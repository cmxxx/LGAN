When I first heard about what a lot of people are calling the 'anti-transgender' law passed in Arkansas last week, it came as a complete surprise to me. I was one of the supporters behind Prop 8 .And so I am quite surprised to hear of this new law passed in Kentucky. Let's all be honest here, it's just a way to try to limit or punish a transgender person's legal rights for that matter.This is a blatant attempt to limit trans* rights under the guise of 'religious freedom'. Here's the problem with that argument though: Religious freedom was never meant to be used this way. And I'll show why it's definitely not fair.First, let's talk about religious liberty. And while LGBT folk should absolutely be concerned about the lack of legal protection and protections from discrimination and harassment, this is a far cry from religious freedom. We are talking about a constitutional amendment, which limits our rights just like any other kind of law.Now, you may be saying, 'But that doesn't seem like a legitimate reason to pass a law!' To which I would say, 'Of course it does, it doesn't matter what the real reason is, it just appears to be a legitimate reason.'But let's take a closer look at this 'religious liberty' law and its religious context, shall we?As you know, a lot of the people that supported Prop 8, were also opposed to gay marriage. And one of the reasons that's happening, in my opinion, is that it is a way for the religious and social conservatives (both of which have a lot in common with the LGBT movement) to gain more control of the public sphere. By taking the issue off the table, they can push their 'family values' agenda that goes against our basic human rights, instead of the other way around. To put it simply, it is a way for religious conservatives to gain more control over our public sphere. This is why all of this is really about control, right here, right now.Now lets be honest here, all of this isn't just happening because you don't like gay people. It's happening because you don't like what we say, what we believe, how we conduct ourselves and what we do in the public sphere. This anti-gay legislation is very similar to laws that were passed in the past against black people. All of the other reasons why it was passed are also exactly the same reasons why it seems to be a violation of your human rights.For example, what if the state wants to restrict gay rights in any way? How is that not a violation of human rights? What if gay marriage is actually something that some people are simply not comfortable with? Does that mean we should not have equal or equal rights in America? Of course not, that would be ridiculous and not in anybody's best interests. What about the issue of bullying? What if this act of discrimination is an attempt to silence or harass LGBT people? Of course not, that would also be in nobody's best interest.So we have laws like Prop 8, but also people like Rick Santorum, who has actually supported laws like this . He even ran ads encouraging people to vote for these kind of laws. In fact, when a law banning gay marriage was being debated in California, Rick Santorum called for a 'civil war' against the 'radical homosexual forces in this country.' He also opposed the Civil Rights Act, which he argued would not protect people from discrimination. But hey, that's just Rick, how can we expect any better from this right-wing zealot?Now, maybe you're starting to see how far right this conservative movement is on this issue. I honestly don't think that's really a surprise either. They are already trying to pass similar laws in other states . And just like the Arkansas law, a lot of people are actually excited about passing these laws, despite what others might think about it. I can tell you for a fact that it has worked on a lot of people because I personally know hundreds or maybe even a few thousand people who would rather have this law passed than have their rights protected.The problem is not the fact that they are trying to pass laws like this, nor it is the fact that they are being so blatantly discriminatory, but rather that it is just another way for conservatives to claim to be protecting freedom of religion or freedom of speech, even when those rights will most likely be used to hurt people that they consider to be 'sub-human', like gays and transgender persons.And I would just ask you to watch this YouTube video again. I don't know your situation, but if you are looking for an extreme level of religious liberty, you could probably take a closer look at this 'religious freedom' bill here: And here's a more personal experience with this "religious freedom" bill:As a college student, I was forced to write a paper on how gay and transgender people were destroying gay marriage and why, and
The FBI is investigating the case as a hate crime following claims that the suspect, Dylann Storm Roof, expressed support for white supremacy in an online post.The suspect reportedly told his churchgoers that he planned to shoot black people because of the "system", according to local reports.Roof is also said to have posted on Facebook that he had pledged allegiance to the leader of the so-called "sovereign citizens movement", Steve King.The case has been referred to the FBI for further investigation.A Facebook post was found that refers to Roof as a "lone wolf" and appears to support white supremacy.Facebook Twitter Pinterest Dylann Storm Roof is charged with nine counts of murder at this court hearing at the South Carolina state court in Columbia, South Carolina. Photograph: Reuters"I had to do it," Roof told authorities, South Carolina sheriff's department officials said. He added he was not part of any "larger group", according to the Associated Press.The FBI are now reportedly investigating whether the killing at his hometown of Charleston was racially motivated."As a matter of course, the FBI is looking at all aspects of the suspect's life and we're talking to a lot of people in this community," John Monahan, special agent in charge at the FBI's Columbia, South Carolina field office, told reporters.

"The thing to know is that he has expressed those views in his own words and he has a history here in our community and this community."Monahan would not comment on the Facebook post. Officials did not release any evidence of the suspect having expressed support for the so-called sovereign citizen movement.Roof, 26, was charged with nine counts of murder for allegedly opening fire on the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church in Charleston, South Carolina, killing nine people. Police believe he targeted the church because of its predominantly black congregants.The suspect's older brother, Daniel, told a news conference: "He doesn't hate anybody. He has nothing against any race." He also said that Roof was "stupid" for getting involved in the shooting.Roof wrote a chilling Facebook post in which he said he wanted to start a race war by executing black people.

He described the suspect as a "monster".On Wednesday, the family of one of the victims, Rev Clementa Pinckney, expressed "heartfelt gratitude" to the community for their support.The Rev Pinckney, was remembered on Wednesday night as an inspiring Christian minister whose life was taken.The city's mayor, Joseph Riley, called him "the most beloved man in Charleston".Charleston shootings: 'That's not the America I know' Read moreThe FBI has offered a $25,000 reward for people who will call them with information about the shooting.

We ask that the media respect those grieving families who want their privacy respected during this trying time. We ask that these hateful crimes be taken away from their families who may need time to grieve."A Facebook post on the website of the Sovereign Citizens of America's local website, South Carolina Law Enforcement Division, also referred to the suspect as Dylann Storm Roof.It is a group that is not recognised by the Federal government but is described as "a broad association of citizens who support and respect the Constitution of the United States and its governing document, the Declaration of Independence".
D-backs third baseman Paul Goldschmidt (6) reacts as he talks to third baseman Brandon Drury (1) after being removed from the game during the third inning of an MLB baseball game against the Chicago Cubs on Thursday, Sept. 15, 2015, in Phoenix. (AP Photo/Ross D. Franklin)PHOENIX — The Arizona Diamondbacks' starting lineup is the reason they've made the playoffs in four of the past five seasons, and that's why the rest of the infield is the target of much of their criticism.Diamondbacks manager Torey Lovullo knows that, and he knows that it makes for a difficult challenge when he needs to choose out of this month's roster five starting players who have combined to play in 1,829 games. But he's also made it clear what's important to him."It's easy to say we don't have a No. 1, a No. 2 and three No. 3 starters," Lovullo said. "That's not the issue at all. I don't think (the issues are) at the top. I think when you start to take a look at what's happened in the field, it's a different story when it comes to our depth and our depth at key positions. That's a different issue."The bottom line is we don't have a No. 2 starter."Diamondbacks manager Torey Lovullo wants the team to play all three teams in the wild-card race by the second week of October so that their chances of winning the World Series will increase.The problem is that as long as the team has a rotation that's comprised of two of Goldschmidt, Zack Greinke and Shelby Miller, or three out of those four starters combined, it's going to remain a question mark who will be the No. 2, third and fourth starter."Yeah, I know that," Lovullo said when asked about a rotation that's lacking a clear No. 2 starter. "It's what we have. We could put on a whole bunch of different guys. I think in the future, in the best interests of our club, I think we would get better by playing all three teams rather than one for four and then the other out of them. I'm not saying you do that all the time."If it was a perfect world, I'd like to have five. It still would be a question. It wouldn't be a problem. But we don't have that in our situation right now. We have a good team. We don't have anyone here that's got the number one potential to be our number one starter. So what's the next step in this?"As Lovullo explained, there's an argument to be made that Goldschmidt and Greinke already are considered the top two, while Miller, the team's top prospect, hasn't been on the big-league club in a year and would need a full-time assignment from AAA Reno to be given the No. 3 spot. Of all three of those position-player-related questions, the one with the most urgency is who will be the fifth starter. All five starters are projected to make at least 32 starts.Lovullo said he is hoping that in some type of move, the Diamondbacks would be able to trade either Miller or third baseman Justin Upton, which would open up a spot for Goldschmidt to play."We'd love to have one of those guys," Lovullo said. "But he didn't turn 23 until May. So unless (GM) Tony La Russa is a complete genius, he's got to keep a lid on those (trade) talks because he knows what his potential is."The final question is what to make of the Diamondbacks' decision not to deal two of their starters for a top prospect. Lovullo said that although the team wanted to add another lefty reliever, the Diamondbacks couldn't get an acceptable deal done to include pitchers Scott Kazmir and A.J. Pollock."I really think if it was a two-for-one deal, to trade Kazmir and Pollock — even just Kazmir — would help our team," Lovullo said. "It's why we couldn't do it. So instead we're going to sit this one out here. But the fact is, the two guys we tried to get, they don't seem like they have the ability at this juncture to pitch and that's the challenge we have in the first half. The guys that we do have are going to have to pitch well and we just didn't feel like at the end of the day we were going to be in a position to address those other needs."This season's schedule is particularly challenging, with only three days off before Thursday's matchup with the Cubs. Still, Lovullo says he
How do you make a show about a guy who is super-intelligent, but super-intelligent isn't super? What you do get is an incredibly weird show that tries to grapple with, but ultimately fails at, what science actually knows about intelligence.It's one thing when the showrunners do not take themselves too seriously, but the main character of Westworld, Bernard (Jeffrey Wright), the guy who heads up the human-equipment startup and who everyone at the park seems to respect, is one hell of a bad guy. That's just how it is, though.AdvertisementIt seems to me that the problem here was that the show is not only going to have a great many episodes about the park's technology, but also about humans, and its producers seem to have realized this is going to be a show, which is all they're ever going to be able to do. Even the bad guy of the series, like the men who run the park, are the ones in the know. It's not like the park's technology is going to get hacked because no one has ever had the ability to hack the park (except perhaps a few of the robots themselves), so if they get hacked, that would just be bad in general, not just the specific characters.So the show's creators have decided to make the robot-haters, the park's antagonists, in some cases sympathetic characters. Not that Bernard ever thinks anyone is wrong, but this is a guy who's at the center of his own empire—and what that empire represents to him and to humanity is a future so great and so beautiful it's hard to understand what the point of all of this is.This is a weird way for the show to go, but as of this writing, it's really going well.AdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisement
It is widely agreed that there is a need for a more open and transparent information policy which is consistent with international treaty obligations, and provides for transparency, consistency, and openness on a global scale. Although there is often concern that an open information policy will not work in terms of achieving its desired outcomes, in this paper we examine the evidence on whether such policies are working in the 21st century and how effectively they are achieving their aims. We find that open information policies are not only highly effective at achieving their goal – to make governments accountable and accountable governments – but also are often more effective than other policy tools at achieving important goals. We find that openness policies often deliver important policy outcomes which would not otherwise have been achieved, including improved transparency, greater efficiency, and greater public engagement. We consider a range of possible ways in which open information policies could be improved in order to further this result.FundingThis paper is written under the auspices of the Nuffield Council on Bioethics.The views expressed in this paper are not necessarily those of the UK research councils or Ofstruments.
For the past two years, the City of Houston has been engaged in negotiations with the city of Houston Independent School District (HiH), a rural district located in southwestern Harris County and located along the South Texas Gulf Coast (STGSC). Although the state does not require districts to have their own schools, most districts do. This negotiation has not been without controversy over the past years as it has taken place between the two districts' officials and the district school board. HiH administrators have repeatedly expressed support for the City of Houston's high standards for education, while HISD has supported HiH's plans to upgrade their schools in order to increase diversity. This has resulted in tensions over which education plan will result in a more academically diverse student body for the HiH district.This year will mark ten years since the Texas Legislature passed SB 17, authorizing the creation of new districts for the cities of Dallas and Houston. HiH became the first district approved for this change in the state legislature's action back in 2007 — which is also the year that Texas Gov. Rick Perry signed SB 16. Following the legislation creating the HiH district, the district's leadership quickly announced that there would be an "extended debate" before the state legislature over the creation of a special district in Humble. This is usually the first year that this process starts for new districts, but it usually takes one or two years. This is the first year where new special districts are even open for discussion, which raises questions about the process and the legitimacy of the process.For instance, some community members may question how the HiH leaders could be satisfied with the new, improved, state-mandated schools when we know that the district's current schools are not meeting the requirements outlined in the legislation. This could be due to several reasons. For example, as the Houston Press explains, a school district must be given an education plan by March 2010 to help "ensure it is prepared to meet the full requirements of the law." However, HiH did not finish their plan until March 4, 2012.A report filed by HiH administrators with the district has also raised questions over the validity of the process:If Hi school board members have a better-educated understanding of what the district has to offer and what they truly think the district should offer, then why is there still so much confusion on what a Hi school should offer?A Hi school should provide a quality education designed to allow for a person of any age or background to thrive. This should be the goal of every educational district. The goal for this district must not be a low-achieving environment.This school system must have a positive effect on the families of the district and not hurt the educational opportunities for the citizens of Houston.HISD can offer the Hi school board the best school environment in the state. Hi school leaders must look for an alternate site for a future high school if they are unable to afford the cost of building them on their present site. An alternative location might also be suitable.As a result of a disagreement with some board members over the plan, HiH is not allowed to discuss its proposed plans with local school board members. They are required to hold a conference in an attempt to reach a consensus on how to proceed. This is a procedure that does not allow for public or private discussions.While it's clear that a district must have its own school sites to comply with the legislature's directive, it would have been better to have the HiH school board meeting occur at a time when all board members were familiar with the plan and its specifics. This decision, however, was apparently made without consultation — and has been challenged.A petition was filed by an attorney who claims that the HiH board and administration are not following the "legislation and regulations" and has called for a review of the entire process. The petition has been reviewed by Attorney James M. Clark and was found not to be within the legal standards to request that action. It is not a clear violation:On the one hand the petition is a valid inquiry into a specific question. On the other hand, it fails to address the fundamental problem surrounding the HiH case: the District Board has been conducting this administrative review in the absence of any legal basis to do so. (…) To the extent the petition does not challenge the legality of the Board's decision, they are not entitled to the legal protections enjoyed by their counterparts. The petition's sole purpose is to attempt to compel a review of the District's decision to deny the petition.And the petition has been rejected:The petition has been dismissed without prejudice where it cannot be proven that the District Board violated applicable constitutional or statutory provisions.As the Harris County District Attorney's Office explained in a recent press release the state of Texas gives special districts a great deal of flexibility over what process or procedures they follow, with certain conditions and guidelines. So while HiH has already stated their intent to
Sugar Shack Diner in Portland, Oregon, is a restaurant that I've written about in the past. Not because it's the best. Not because of the weirdness it has as a menu item. But for the fact that its menu contains something that, for me, is like a dream come true. It's something that I'm thrilled to find that there are good-quality, real-food Diners out there.The owner is a friend of mine, and our mutual friend, Jason Kastner, also owns Lucky's in Berkeley, California, a Diner that I've said is probably better than any other in the country.I recently wrote about that restaurant because I had just had lunch there, and I've been itching to write about Sugar Shack for a long time. So last week, after I came back from lunch, my roommate told me to go check this place out on Google Maps.I've never been to a Diner in Oregon. I had only visited the University of Nebraska at Omaha Diner in the mid 1990's. I had come to Omaha because I was a resident at the University of Nebraska at Omaha, and my roommates told me that this was my best choice for a good meal and to not go anywhere else. Omaha had excellent Diners.I love to eat, and I love to study, so it didn't hurt that the University of Nebraska at Omaha Diner is not terribly far from my house in Omaha. This is my favorite time of day, too. It's usually nice and cool in Nebraska in June and July. There's a high summer rain, and I would ride a bike with my bike helmet on. I remember how great that was for a bike rider, and the sun was warm, the bike felt good, and I just felt so good. I loved it! There were no pretries anywhere, or anything I hadn't gotten before.I'm glad that I went to Omaha. I loved the place, so I'm glad I went back there for a meal. It's the kind of place where I'll have a great meal for dinner and breakfast. I love eating, and I love studying, so it didn't hurt that the University of Nebraska at Omaha Diner is not terribly far from my house in Omaha. This is my favorite time of day, too. It's usually nice and cool in Nebraska in June and July. There's a high summer rain, and I would ride a bike with my bike helmet on. I remember how great that was for a bike rider, and the sun was warm, the bike felt good, and I just felt so good. I loved it! There were no pretries anywhere, or anything I hadn't gotten before.When I was in college, Omaha was my favorite place to go to when I had classes. I was the one teaching class at my school, and I went to Omaha because it was a great place for studying, and it was just a whole lot further away than where I lived. This kind of reminds me of that time.I love Sugar Shack because it is everything I imagined Sweetie Diner would be. Sweetie Diner is kind of a Diner that also has a great menu and a great owner (the owner of Lucky's in Berkeley, Cali.) and a great location in Berkeley, California.Like Sweetie Diner, Sugar Shack in Portland has a great menu. It features a wide variety of Diners. I was told it also has a great wine list. It's an institution for an institution of a reason.I love that on the menu is an option for a Salad with Fruit and A Side of Ice Cream. Sweetie Diner's Salad did not come with Fruit and A Side of Ice Cream, in addition to an option for a Salad without Fruit (the Fruit Diner does).But this Salad, with A Side of Ice Cream, did come with Fruit and A Side of Ice Cream. I love that there is a big option for an Ice Cream, but that the Salad was still very much a Fruit Diner, because the other Diner options were Fruit.I love that after the Ice Cream came Ice Cream Chunks. That's how I knew what was going on here. The size of these Chunks was perfect. So much so, that I didn't really want to wait for the Ice Cream to chill, so I kept eating them with the Ice Cream. How fun, right? What a great Ice Cream.It also tastes a lot like Sweetie Diner, but it's not as smooth as Sweetie Diner's Ice Cream. I didn't love my Sweetie Diner, but I think I prefer the consistency of the Ice Cream on my Ice Cream Chunks here.I have to say, the Ice Cream did have a stronger almond taste, and it was a bit more creamy. But I'm not totally sure why Sweetie Diner

TUSCALOOSA, Alabama – Auburn announced on Monday that offensive lineman John Franklin III will be suspended for two conference games and another two for a related NCAA violation.He is also barred from participating in team activities during the suspension.If the suspension is served through the 2014 regular season, Franklin would not be eligible to return until after the bowl season.Franklin, a redshirt freshman, is Auburn's only true right hand offensive lineman as starters Jake Fromm and Dontavius Russell are injured. Fromm is the starter and Russell moved to right guard for the second game of the season last week while Franklin worked on an assignment.Franklin was also banned from team activities for Auburn's game at Houston on Sept. 27.It's the second straight suspension for the junior offensive lineman. In the spring, he was suspended one game and fined $10,000 for a false start penalty against Kentucky early in the month of July.After Franklin's fine, he was allowed to play in Auburn's SEC Championship Game loss to Alabama, but Auburn coach Gus Malzahn said he and his staff would continue to monitor Franklin closely for the remainder of the season.
The city has in recent years seen a boom in the number of foreign immigrants, who largely arrive to work in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. The influx of workers has led to the creation of a large high school, a professional sports franchise, a college football arena, and a theater and concert hall.However, critics say this growth has had a negative impact on the local public schools.According to the New Jersey Department of Education, high school graduation rates for students admitted to NJIT's Jersey City Public Schools are significantly below the national average, and the state average is currently the worst in the country."It's always a goal to break down the barriers in education," said Jadran Abid, NJIT vice president of student leadership and research. "I think there's a lot of ways for us to do that."During its "Build NJ" week in June, NJIT hosted the city's first "Global Entrepreneur Day," attended by representatives from the business, non-profit, technology, and academic communities to discuss and share opportunities as an indicator to break down barriers of access and opportunities for the community."We've made some gains," said Abid. "These are numbers. They are averages, and we're going to have to be continually working to build on what we have."As an academic institution, NJIT offers bachelor's degree pathways in engineering, business, communications, human resources, and more, and the schools offers several certificates and associate degrees, as well.While graduation rates for students admitted to Rutgers University-Newark are among the highest in the United States, students in Newark attend a fraction of the classes offered, and their educational outcomes are not particularly different from those of their peers in urban districts."From my perspective as a parent that's my biggest desire," said Abid. "Just look at the results, we have our own numbers, in most cases we're better."At the same time, schools in Newark have not been exempt of the national decline in students enrolled in their regular programs."It's still a concern," said Abid. "When I first sat down with the superintendent back in September, one of the reasons why I made this move was to bring attention, but I want to be clear, this is about getting things moving, we have to have an emphasis on our urban district. But I don't want to be more negative than I have to."There is a level of hope that we can help people feel like they can succeed," he continued. "We have to see these numbers, and if we go to school buildings and students are not going in the same classes as their peers around the country, we know that's an issue."During the Build NJ week, Abid also hosted a series of sessions dedicated to bringing together students to discuss their specific concerns, including those of those of teachers, principals, and their families. Abid also noted that the conference drew attendees from the public, private, and charter public school systems."I know many of those parents," said Abid. "When I took on this project we had no idea where these students would wind up. But if we can be part of a process that helps them make the transition into Newark when they finish school here, or if we get a chance to develop solutions that we don't even know are in place here – that's a tremendous opportunity."The week's sessions focused on topics including high school graduation, early action graduation plans, and college readiness strategies for Newark-based students."We'll continue to work together to achieve better outcomes, better performance," Abid said. "We don't just want to be average for the region, we want to be average for the state."
After the Supreme Court handed down two rulings upholding "gay marriage," a flurry of lawsuits emerged.These lawsuits involve not only gay people, but also religious minorities who fear losing the religious freedom protections of the Constitution. The lawsuits also challenge the federal government's policies and actions, such as its recent decision to continue funding the HHS health care mandates for religious-affiliated providers. So when the Supreme Court ruled Thursday that "religious institutions" would be granted the right to deny same-sex couples healthcare benefits, these lawsuits immediately came into focus.In Texas, the legal challenge centers on a lawsuit filed against the state that seeks to deny same-sex couples the right to adopt children. The case was dismissed by the Texas Supreme Court, but the plaintiffs appealed and have filed a brief with the United States Supreme Court. According to the brief, the state's refusal to recognize same-sex marriages violates the Fourteenth Amendment and is not a rational governmental interest. The brief points to legal rulings in other states that have allowed a limited right to same-sex marriage, or recognized same-sex marriages for the purposes of adoption. It is hoped that the brief will cause the Supreme Court to rule that Texas' bans on same-sex marriage are unconstitutional.In Florida, the litigation comes from a gay couple seeking to adopt their adopted daughter and other related claims.The same two lawsuits also appear before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in Atlanta. In a concurring opinion in the lower court ruling, the court recognized "the fundamental right of parents and parents-in-law to rear their biological and adopted children, including the right to a meaningful relationship with such children as the ultimate goal of adoption." If the Supreme Court sides with the Fifth Circuit, it would uphold federal recognition of gay marriages, but it would not impose the same constitutional protections for same-sex couples that same-sex couples have in other states. In that case, the Fifth Circuit's opinion would become precedent in the Fifth Circuit.In Tennessee, an appeals court recently sided with a same-sex couple seeking to adopt, but only after the Tennessee legislature eliminated the same benefits as straight couples in order to preserve marriage.These cases bring up questions of public policy and religious freedom, as well as the government's responsibilities to protect individuals' rights under the law. In this day and age, it is not unreasonable to ask whether "religious freedom" is a fundamental freedom under the United States Constitution, and if so, in what way.AdvertisementBut one issue that has been largely ignored in the discussion of these lawsuits is the Constitutionality of these laws, which are based on the definition of marriage that was established in the Supreme Court's 2007 decision in Lawrence v. Texas. For the most part, the plaintiffs in these lawsuits are merely seeking the right to marry. This is particularly problematic in the case of the Tennessee marriage law, which, as previously noted, was based on the definition of marriage provided in Lawrence, even though the Supreme Court itself did not interpret that definition as providing the right to marriage. The only difference between the Tennessee and the Texas laws is that the definition of marriage provided in the Supreme Court's definition is different from the definition provided by the legislature in Tennessee, even though both statutes reflect the same definition of marriage. To say that the Tennessee definition of marriage is unconstitutional because it is not based on the Court's view of marriage is not to say that any one definition of marriage is unconstitutional. Rather, it is to say that the definition of marriage has been subject to change over time that does not comport with the Supreme Court's definition of marriage.The Tennessee legislature's definition of marriage is in clear violation of the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution. The Supreme Court in Lawrence v. Texas noted that, "the Fourteenth Amendment commands that, insofar as the Constitution protects the liberty of individual States to define 'marriage,' it prohibits the Federal Government from passing anyone's preferred definition." This is most often the case when the federal government's actions and policies are more restrictive and expansive than those of individual states, as in the realm of immigration and marriage. Therefore, this case is important because it is the first time that the Supreme Court has ruled that a state's definition of marriage does not violate equal protection protections guaranteed by the 14th Amendment.At this point, one question is to be asked: Did Justice Kennedy, who wrote the majority opinion in the majority opinion in Lawrence, support any other type of definition of marriage? Did he ever state that traditional marriage does not violate equal protection laws? We will have to wait for the briefs and transcripts from oral arguments, but it is clear he was not interested in upholding a definition of marriage that he himself characterized as a "false promise."The only thing I can say for certainty is that Justice Scalia and Justice Thomas joined their colleagues' opinion in the majority in Lawrence, although there was some debate among the Justices about whether or not Lawrence itself did hold a firm interpretation of marriage.
I'm so sorry…I love you. It's been almost a year and a half since we were in a relationship, and I know I've said this many times on this blog. I was an idiot to think that one day I could be happy with one person. All my life I've heard people say that, so it was hard to believe I could actually find someone that I could fall in love with.After much consideration I've decided to break off my relationship with my ex-boyfriend of over six years (he is, in fact, a genius and a good friend). My heart is broken…my mind is torn. My heart will never truly be the same again–but the way the feelings are running through me is overwhelming, and hard to bear.After six years of being in a relationship, it's time to say I'm done. And that means I have to let go.I would never want anyone to hurt me after I've given my heart to an idea and my soul to someone. And that's exactly what happened to me with my ex-boyfriend. I don't have to be a saint to give my heart to someone (I'm pretty sure there is actually a category of saints), but I must have someone in mind. I want someone that will accept me–because that's all anyone can ask for.I am not looking for someone that will be good for me–though I will miss him too. I just hope that it won't take too long for us to get out of our relationship. I was so worried that I may go through something similar in 2015, thinking that we would just break up and be back together soon. I have no recollection of wanting to break up with him. If there was any chance of us breaking up in 2015, we had gone a long time with only seeing each other every few months. It feels like yesterday.One thing I'd like to make clear–it wasn't only because we couldn't be together for as long as I wanted to. I have always told myself that this would happen eventually anyway, and that I was lucky to have found this person who would do more for me than an hour. I have made that decision in the past and have always accepted it and moved on, even when it didn't turn out to be what I thought it was. It didn't turn out to be the person that I wanted, but that's okay.I've made the decision a long time ago that I'm no longer going to be a saint. I love that there will be someone who will love me in exchange for the gift of my heart–the life of my soul. Now I just have to work on getting there.So why can I not see my ex-boyfriend's face?I know some people will say, "but you told him how much you love him, didn't you?" And that's true, but it's nothing to compare with my love for him. The reason why I had to break things off with him is because of everything I've lived with him. When you have a secret such as this that is so private, you can never truly give your heart to anyone again–but I can't allow my heart to be broken. The feelings that I had for him, and the feelings I had after I went through a whole new relationship with a man with just as much potential. The person he was, the person he was to me, and the feelings I have in regards to him are just so powerful.I believe that I can get to where I want to be. But the only way I can do that is first to let go–and then to find more than someone who accepts my heart. I don't want to have to work my ass off just to have the person that I want, I want to have someone that accepts me–to be honest, who accepts me, who accepts everything about me and my life is just too much to come by.I want to thank everyone who has been reading my website since I've been posting. I think I've received many messages from people who don't believe that I'm a slut, or that I could get a guy just for the sex. I can only hope that someone gets the same feelings I'm feeling here. You will always have my heart, no matter what–whatever it may be…
The European Union said on Thursday that it wants to "deconflict" its military operation with air, land and sea forces as it focuses on destroying an Islamic State (IS) group stronghold in northeastern Syria in the first weeks after the jihadists were routed from Sirte, Libya, on June 28.EU foreign ministers will now meet in Brussels on June 25 and 26."We are discussing a common European action to support an operation against Daesh in Libya, with an eye to establishing a shared European approach to this campaign," EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini told a briefing....
It's only a small, one-lane stretch of highway that leads to the edge of downtown, but the winding road has transformed West Palm Beach and Palm Springs — the former becoming one of the region's premier hot spots, the latter becoming the epicenter for an emerging culture of urban-freight rail transit. "I think it's a paradigm shift," says Mark Crain, a historian who has written extensively about the railroads that ran from Ohio and Missouri, through southern Illinois, on up the Pacific Coast, connecting ports on the west and east coast through California, before the Great Depression."It's an alternative form of transportation," explains Rick Dinsmore, the vice president of development at the Riverside Community Council, a nonprofit development company located along the rail corridor. "Somehow it became this viable way to build housing. When that happened, you see a lot of other things change."With a price tag of more than $30-billion, Florida's state-of-the-art rail system is the envy of the nation's other coastal regions. Just in Palm Beach alone, 10,000 new homes have been built while more than 30 major projects are in the planning stages, along with more than $2 billion in additional investment. The county was the first to develop a full-service rail line — the first "subway" west of the Mississippi River — and it was followed up with an expansion to Miami. Today Palm begrudgingly admits that the train, which has served as a test bed for everything from train stations to passenger boarding systems, remains, well, unfinished. Still, local leaders are cautiously welcoming the development that the rail line has spurred."We've seen a lot of work that's come together, but some of these things have to be done more quickly — I think we could be on the rails before the sun set on the rest of South Florida," says Michael Van Sickle, chairman of Palm Beach Community Development Corporation, a civic group that's also involved in the rail effort.It helps that the two communities are relatively close to each other, with the average distance between the two cities a scant 4 miles. And a little bit of Southern charm can't hurt. "People don't realize that the city of Palm Beach has this beautiful waterfront right by the tracks that is, by far, our most popular tourist area," says Crain.As we've learned from other recent developments within Palm Beach County, that waterfront is already well-serviced by the rails. As of now, only a small portion of the first phase of rail transit (which goes from Boca Raton to West Palm Beach for now) is being used as a main artery. The entire first phase is slated to be completed by 2019. A full phase for a total route that extends all the way from Boca Raton to West Palm Beach, which would connect the city's two biggest tourism attractions, the oceanfront Palm Beaches and the city's other attractions, would cost about $1.5 billion more.Meanwhile, the county is still figuring out how the $500 million in tax credits being given to a new terminal in West Palm Beach will help the project. The county originally hoped to give a $200 million investment to help build the first phase. But local leaders have come to realize that the track might never be completed on schedule, and the county ended up giving just $60 million toward the development. "At this point is not necessarily the best time to announce the tax credits," says Crain. "We've seen plenty of other announcements that have never materialized."If it does make it happen, the terminal would certainly prove a big boost for West Palm Beach. The Palm Beach Post has reported that about 50,000 tourists a week could use the terminal, and that a significant number of them would probably be traveling to Palm Beach International, meaning they'd fly down for a night in a hotel — a big boon to the city's already growing local economy.But many locals are skeptical of the project. While some have questioned whether the local businesses in the area are up to snuff, others worry that the trains will create more traffic problems that would ultimately hinder commerce and quality of life in the area."I don't see it as a big-ticket item," says Van Sickle. "I think a lot of it is just going to be an economic development strategy rather than an actual transportation issue. To me, the whole idea of rail transit is that it's for economic development and jobs, and that's what we're focusing on. If that's the case, how does a train stop in Downtown West Palm get people into downtown West Palm Park?"Others, however, are more sympathetic. As he drives to work through West Palm Beach today, Dinsmore notes that many of his passengers are "people who are working in South Florida and coming into Palm Beach.""It is a lot of work, but at the same time

The term "court of the United States" as used in this subdivision shall include courts of record of the United States or any court of the State of California."For those who would prefer to read to yourself, the new legislation was introduced and passed by the California State Assembly just days before the December 16th deadline for the California State Senate and Assembly to reach concurrence, and without the possibility of a veto from Governor Jerry Brown, who has stated that he is not in favor of the bill. It was passed in a 51-17 vote. The bill will now be presented to Gov. Brown for his decision.As I wrote last night, the California Firearms Manufacturers Association (Compact) said in a written statement of opposition, "...[f]irmly opposes AB 710 (Senate bill 2249), which expands gun registration to California's law-abiding, but already licensed, gun owners. Our members face a multitude of complex problems that need to be addressed, but the law would only impede their ability to acquire firearms to solve those problems."The law will require all owners of guns to keep such records for five years (not just for an individual permit/license, but for those for a company, a partnership, or a corporation as well), including those who do not hold a "transfer" permit, but would not require them to give that information to anyone else (no matter what it's owner might do with it).Those who would like to get a copy of those records can go to a public library or the government's official registration service, the Attorney General's Office (AGO), or go to the website of the Registrar of Firearms.[Editor's Note: This post has been updated to reflect the official text of the bill.]The first few pages of the law have been posted on the official site of Gov. Brown. I encourage readers to explore the entire bill here.UPDATE: It has been pointed out that a number of other states including Washington, Massachusetts, and New York require more extensive background checks upon all firearms transfer, some requiring that the purchase be approved by a licensed dealer that conducts a background check as well as a check of the seller. The ATF defines the term "transfer," as "an exchange of title by a dealer, or by a dealer's employee with consent of the transferee, and includes a loan or rental of a firearm by a dealer and includes a sale or lease by a dealer of a firearm to a retailer or wholesale merchant."Many states have adopted a "one stop shop" or instant check provision. These include California, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia.A recent poll published in the Las Vegas Review Journal shows that 62% of Nevadans oppose universal background checks.
In the past, it might have seemed that the world would become a little more peaceful — that it would begin to resemble a happier and more peaceful age, full of peace, harmony and harmony in a kind of utopian utopia. That's not the case. As the world continues to become more dangerous and unstable, it certainly seems that a growing number of people are trying to stay away from the risks that seem to be increasing the most at the moment.As the first decade of the twenty-first century rolls around, many countries are dealing with multiple threats from terrorism and war to political and economic challenges that are both domestic and overseas. In particular, the world is witnessing the rise of a new phenomenon that will be with us for quite a long time — the phenomenon of nationalism — with its emphasis on nationhood, sovereignty and national pride.Most of us aren't particularly comfortable with talking about nationalism, even though it is becoming increasingly prominent throughout the world. There are some who believe that it is a bad thing — that the country a person lives in or the political system a country uses should not be a factor in how well someone lives, works and plays in this world. As if only people in one country or one political system can be better or worse than anyone else at anything.But this is a misguided conception. Nationalism isn't simply a matter of whether one's nation is politically unified or not within the borders of that nation. Rather, it's a much more general term that refers to the belief that the citizens of a nation are, in principle, better off living in a specific geographic area — that is, a nation's borders — than in any other geographic area. This can have a number of consequences, including the belief that all people living in specific geographical areas are better off than all other people living in other areas.One can't help but note that this is what has happened when many political systems are dominated by nationalist trends. Nationalism comes to exist as a response to the growing instability of a region, or the country, that was once peaceful, prosperous and relatively stable. The problem, though, has generally not been an over-reliance on nationalism (or any particular political system).The root issue, of course, is the rising danger of terrorism — especially the radicalization of young people from various national backgrounds. It all starts to add up to make much more sense when one realizes that many of the root reasons for the increase in anti-Western violence have been created by nationalism (or, as we should now say, a fear of nationalism.)What are these root causes for the growing number of people who fear political, economic and personal insecurity?We often think of nationalism as being primarily about pride and nationalism is one very important element of that, along with a sense of being superior to others in a particular sense of national pride. But, nationalism is also, in many instances, about being able to do something in the face of uncertainty, including the lack of certainty about a person's future. This is especially true for those individuals who cannot see an obvious future in their lifetime. This is why it makes sense that a country with a stronger sense of national pride is generally able to deal with and overcome uncertainty more effectively than one with weaker national pride.It also makes sense that a country with a lot of people concentrated in one place will tend to experience the same kinds of economic problems that people with a lot of people scattered around the country experience — that is, a sense of uncertainty and decline. This is because, just as with national pride, national pride is an emotional response that often includes a high level of certainty. It is a response that is triggered when that region is experiencing trouble, when there is a sense of the future uncertain, or simply when a new problem occurs.But when some people feel more uncertain, when others feel more prosperous, when a lot of people feel that there are fewer problems to deal with, it often creates feelings of hostility and resentment, especially among those who are perceived as being at the margins, like gays or people of a particular religious tradition.Of course, not everyone who is feeling more pessimistic about the future becomes a racist or a homophobe. But the danger really lies in the general belief that there are more or less certain places where one's future lives. As one can see from this, when people believe that there are less stable communities where one can develop one's skills and abilities in a way that benefits others, then this can create resentments, anger and hate crimes.Just like the increasing violence and discrimination toward people who are gay and lesbian in some areas of the world, this is certainly another example of the increasing problem with nationalism, and its root causes.The more vulnerable among us who need government services and protections from violence have a right to an orderly society, and we have a duty as civilized people to make certain that these rights are afforded to everyone — including those who may not currently be living in those
The following blog entry was written in March 2013 and posted to the official blog. The blog has been dormant until June 2017.I don't consider myself part of any religious camp. My own spiritual beliefs are of the non-religious variety. It's a great comfort to know that there are a good number of people out there that share my belief. This blog will feature news of new books available in both paperback and e-book formats. As you can imagine this is by no means a comprehensive blog, I have been working with two partners on this project, they are both booksellers. I will be able to update my website and a few of my other social media outlets to show when new books are out and when other new products have been released.Thank you for your support in the past.M.
The Supreme Court rejected a challenge to the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act in a 4-4 vote Tuesday, with the Justices split along ideological lines, allowing the controversial law to stand.The law, signed by President Obama four years ago, will require nearly all Americans to obtain health insurance by 2014 or face a federal fine of $95 or 1 percent of family income. The law also will create a subsidy that will reduce the premiums for people making between 100 percent and 250 percent of the federal poverty rate.The case concerned the mandate of the law, which the Supreme Court upheld in 2012. The court, however, left the subsidies up to the states. The state of Georgia, one of the plaintiffs, was the only state that sued the federal government, arguing that the federal agency could not enforce the mandate. The Supreme Court said the court's opinion on the law did not alter the case at hand.[pullquote]"This case does not concern the merits of the health-care law," Chief Justice John Roberts wrote.Writing a separate opinion, Justice Samuel Alito said it was a "fundamental right" for individuals to enroll in health insurance, and he voted against the majority opinion."A statute enacted to provide health care security and financial protection is a legitimate exercise of state power under the federal constitution," he wrote.Justice Anthony Kennedy, who wrote that decision and wrote the dissenting opinion on Tuesday, was the sole dissenter that day.Chief Justice Roberts wrote that if the court disagreed with Congress, one way would be to "refuse to enforce" any of the law. He said that Congress had a "very good" reason to pass the statute, and that is that the courts are powerless to enforce other laws."The federal courts are no more equipped to carry out our federal constitution than are state or local courts," he wrote.That sentiment was shared by Justice Alito, who said the court "has never suggested that a state legislature cannot lawfully enact a program that is as extensive as the federal health-care law."But he added that "individual states would not suffer from the lack of enforcement" because of the mandate, and, in his view, that decision was the correct one."A state law that imposes a penalty of 100 percent of the Federal Poverty Level for not purchasing health insurance is not a federal law," Alito wrote. "And it is, thus, the state's prerogative to make this choice."Roberts and Alito agreed on the majority opinion, but not the opinion's language. A dissenter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, wrote that her opinion only referred to the law as a whole, not to individual parts. Ginsburg said she thought the individual regulations that were upheld in a different case were constitutional.Ginsburg's dissent stemmed from the fact that she was the only Justice to vote to uphold Obamacare, and she believed it was improper for the court to overturn the entire law.Alito said the court could not overturn a single sentence of the law, nor should Roberts write a dissenting opinion because he was the only Justice to vote to overturn all the law.The case was brought by Georgia. The law will remain in place through the 2014 midterm elections, and it could be re-enacted at any time should Congress do not act.In a separate ruling, the Court granted a request from the State of Washington to block the Medicaid expansion of the ACA. The decision means that the state, which had previously declined to expand Medicaid, will be forced to implement the expanded coverage of health care to about 350,000 low-income adults with families.This case, however, did have a direct impact on the Obamacare mandate because it is part of the individual mandate. The case was brought by a group of employers and state government officials opposed to the law's expansion of Medicaid, along with the American Federation of Teachers and the National Urban League of Greater Washington.The individual mandate is part of the ACA. The mandate requires Americans to have health insurance or pay a penalty to the IRS for not having it. Under the Supreme Court ruling on Tuesday, the individual mandate can only occur if one person does not purchase health insurance: no one can be forced to carry insurance, only a small percentage of the population is affected by the mandate.The case will be reheard in January, when the court will decide if the individual mandate is constitutional.
The federal government's decision to slash funding for research on a treatment for HIV could prevent many more people from receiving treatment, an expert on medical research warns.The decision by Health Minister Sussan Ley came in response to recommendations made by the Royal Australasian College of Physicians.The current funding model will be in place for five years, which will include a trial and approval process for funding for a universal cure - currently being considered by two US groups after successful clinical trials there.RACP president Professor Greg Woods said the cuts to Australia's investment in research meant less access to treatment, which could ultimately lead to more infections."The best way to approach this is to look at what the research can actually do to improve a person's health, which the RACP would clearly agree would be the best outcome," Professor Woods said."Unfortunately, what we are also seeing here is where Government-funded research has been redirected towards other priorities in health."HIV/Aids Research Australia was awarded $2.4 million of the $2.9 million ($1.3 million Australian) it will receive for research. But the organisation has not been given any information about the research programme funding, beyond that to be released at a later date.Mr Ley said the current funding model was "no longer capable of supporting a significant proportion of HIV research for the next decade". He said there would be no further announcements on the matter.The Australian HIV/AIDS Alliance (now called Positive Health Alliance) said the decision was disappointing but it had not come as a shock.The chief executive said the RACP's call for cuts to the National Aids Strategy, which would be implemented through the Government's Budget."It means that less money will be available to fight the epidemic globally, as well as in Australia," he said."It's a shame but that's the reality. This government has actually gutted the National Aids Strategy to zero, and that makes a lot of us very concerned."This is clearly a sign that no, this government does not mean business from the start when it comes to tackling the epidemic, and the government's behaviour is not making things easier for doctors to access treatment."Topics: medical-research, diseases-and-disorders, diseases-and-disorders---human-rights, budget, federal---state-issues, health-policy, health, australiaFirst posted

In the spirit of the pastimes of his youth, former Minnesota Timberwolves point guard Ricky Rubio, 41, has been playing basketball on Saturday nights since he was a boy. His current coach, Tom Thibodeau, played basketball after he was in high school.But it wasn't until Rubio became a professional basketball player in Spain, where he spent two seasons, and then in NBA Europe's league that the sport began to intrigue him. He even played professional baseball, where he had a stellar career."I saw it for what it was," Thibodeau said after Rubio's NBA Summer League debut in Orlando this week. "He's a really good basketball player, and he's got a lot of upside and an opportunity to grow. He's got to be part of the group. He just wants to get better."As the Timberwolves prepare to open their fourth season at home Tuesday against the San Antonio Spurs, Rubio will have to find his place and continue his transformation from basketball prodigy to NBA pro.During last season's training camp, Thibodeau worked with Rubio extensively, and the pair have gotten along well. Both are driven to get the most out of each possession, and are eager for each game and moment."I believe in what we're doing as [the players] and the coaches, and I'm learning to trust that. You try your best, but you trust your teammates and coaches. It's a good feeling," Rubio said after a preseason victory over Memphis. "We just play to win, and I'm excited for the opportunity."The former college star can already see the progress. The Wolves' offseason workout schedule gives Rubio ample opportunities to work with his teammates. His teammates, coaches and Thibodeau love seeing the growth."He goes at it hard, and he's one of the good dudes we have. He has so much potential, and I like the guy," Minnesota coach Rick Adelman said. "He's got the mentality of a young kid, and a little bit of a kid in his voice. But he can also play a few years in this league, and he can play well. He's a good kid."Teammates and coaches said they are impressed by Rubio's athleticism and how he moves. Adelman said he is looking forward to running and working with Rubio, whose athleticism allows him to guard guards, but who can also protect the rim on a defensive rebound."It's exciting," Thibodeau said of Rubio's potential. "I like his growth from two years ago when he went to Spain. He could not be playing in our league when he came here, but I know he's ready to go. He's an unbelievable athlete for his size and how he shoots the ball. I think he's going to make us better."

A couple of months ago, I had the opportunity to discuss the new and updated ICS SDK and Android Studio with Tim Bray, the CTO of Android at Google. This was a fascinating time because Tim was a key part of the original Android team that created the Android SDK. As a part of that original team, Tim was responsible for the development of the Android SDK prior to the release of SDK 7.0.I've never really been able to get in to the Android world because I've always spent most of my time on iOS. In my first time using Android, I was blown away. Every piece of functionality I used was so intuitive and polished. The entire SDK seemed to be geared towards helping developers create great mobile experiences. It was so smooth, and it was so simple. I could not believe that I could use apps on both devices as I had never seen anything like it. The SDK was so well defined, that it seemed like it was designed to be a living library that always needed updating. I was always updating existing code instead of creating completely new versions. I can't imagine the amount of work that was going into that with each release.In my first time using Android, I wanted to be able to use the SDK on iOS. I want a developer product that I can use any time I want. I want to be able to just open up the app, and immediately start talking to my iPhone or iPod Touch. But, my frustration got into my attitude and I became disenchanted with the Android ecosystem. The SDK was such a great thing to have that I felt it should be on both mobile platforms. I did not want to have to learn something all over again when I was using an Android phone on my iPhone.When I left Android and tried to get into iOS development, I was completely discouraged at first. Not only was there more stuff to learn, it was going to take longer to get my head around, simply because it was so much more complicated, and I had a hard time grasping things. After talking to Tim, I found that it really did not take too long at all to get a decent understanding of the SDK if I just took it apart and did it in smaller pieces at first. In the first couple of weeks, I was able to build an app that was based on the existing code of the SDK. I thought the project would never be finished because the time involved was too high. But, one thing I discovered is that it actually was much easier, than I had imagined. And, it didn't take too long at all. And when I look at an update to the SDK, the time to learn the new features are almost never greater than the time I spent learning the new functionality of an app.Android was not the first platform to build an SDK. That fact does seem like a very strange thing to say. But, that was the point that Tim made. The Android team didn't create the SDK for everyone to use. They created it for a specific user base. Android was about a specific type of user, developers, who created apps and wanted easy, intuitive access to the Android SDK. The Android user base that uses an Android device has a unique and defined set of needs, and that's exactly what the Android SDK is designed to help with. The reality is that developers have a wide array of needs and a wide array of skills. When you're building an app for one type, you're likely building an app that's designed around a certain set of features or user interface paradigms. When you're building for a different type, you're likely building an app that's designed around a different set of features or user interface paradigms. And, that's where the Android SDK is so perfect for developers who build apps primarily for Android users.When I told Tim it was all about the Android user base, Tim was very enthusiastic. That is great news because Android is going to be a very popular platform for mobile devices in the upcoming years. Android is going to have to appeal to as many users as possible. While there are always going to be people out there who do not use Android devices, there also won't be people who use them. So, if developers are going to be competing for those users, then they need something that will help them win those users over.This is where the Android SDK is so very successful. Every single element of this SDK and how to use it is designed for the average developer, to help them win over any new users they might find. There is no learning curve for beginners. There's no complicated menus or hidden buttons. You won't have to read forums and read tutorials. All of this is so simple that it will take you no time at all. It will also take you no time at all to read about things that you don't understand and help you move forward. For developers that know how to use an IDE for a particular language or platform, this is exactly what they should be looking for to
The following is an excerpt from In the Blood: One Man's Journey to Justice for the Murdered Family and a Call to Action. It first published in the August/September 2016 edition of the magazine. Subsequent excerpts are available in different formats:My son Adam is my hero.And for the last four years his story and mine have been told in the open air, in the open, on the streets of Oakland. He is my story's hero because of me. Because of my husband. Because of my son, Adam.The first time I heard it, he was crying on the sidewalk. My son and his dad had just been shot by an Oakland police officer. They had just been shot for doing nothing, having not done anything.His dad had been on his way out of the house, just a block from the house we live in. He was on his way out to buy some groceries, to get some food, to go pick up some kids from the park, to come home. He was going out that very night.He went into the apartment house across from us, so his kids can play, and he said, "I'm leaving you guys a message," and hung up the phone. And all of the sudden the police, with tasers drawn, were just standing in the doorway of the house across from us — they had turned their backs, so they weren't facing us — and they just started yelling at my son and his dad.All of a sudden the cops start to yell at the dad, "Get down!" he said. They start to yell at him for no reason, just because he's the dad of the guy who has been killed. He was yelling at the people in the house too, and he was yelling at the officers.He was yelling at them for two or three minutes.He yelled one last time at the officers, "I'm going to turn around," and he did, turned around. So now my son is in front of the officer, the police officer shoots him, and you heard him scream in agony.And there was blood everywhere. He fell to the ground. He was bleeding. And he was still moaning and screaming for help.And that's where he left his phone, because he ran away. And when my son ran away, they chased him down, he says, and arrested him for trespassing. So I ran after him. I said, "What's wrong with you?" Then they shot him through the heart.When he fell, they cuffed him, and he was bleeding and they were putting him in the back of a police car. The cops didn't put him in a hospital, did they? I didn't see him, I didn't hear him cry out. I didn't hear him saying, "I'm sorry." He was just crying.He was handcuffed for about an hour and a half in that police car. And then he was driven home in an ambulance. As the ambulance pulled away from me, he kept saying, "Mom, I'm sorry." And I said "Mom, I'm so sorry."They drove him home in the back of the ambulance — I think it was an ambulance, the city owned the ambulance — and he was sitting on the couch in front of the TV, holding his son's toy toy truck. And I was sitting on the other side of the couch, holding my son's toy truck. They drove him home. And the next day they took him back to the hospital where his heart was in an artificial ventilator, and I was driving him back and forth back and forth between the hospital and his room in the juvenile jail.Finally, five years after that, just before the day I went to see him and to tell him that I'd moved on [to California] to raise my family — which was two years ago — so he didn't know about his father not dying, just about the fact that I'd gone from him and his dad back to Arizona — so he couldn't tell my family back home — I told him one last time: "You were a great daddy to me, and I loved being a mommy to you." And that's it. They took him away, and then, after his heart stopped, the police said they just wanted to go get his truck. "Get his truck." Because he didn't have to go the juvenile jail with his heart in an artificial ventilator for five years. He didn't have to. The heart was fine.He was a good boy. I'm angry about what went on. I'm angry at every cop. I have to stop them. I have to say, "You're hurting my son. That's a criminal." That's what you told him when he was little, and you just keep doing it. I've got a son right now, he's 15 years old, and he
What is the difference between a male and female brain?What is the difference between a male and female brain?The differences in the size and structure of the human brain are thought to be the result of a long evolutionary history, with the brain being more likely to adapt for one gender role and less well suited for another.For example, male brains evolved to be capable of hunting and gathering while female brains evolved to allow for caring for babies. Both genders had evolved to be able to process information and make decisions.However, recent research into the evolution of gender differences in the human brain have shown there may be a lot less difference between male and female brains than previously believed.The study found that the average differences in the size and density of the human brain's various regions are smaller than some would expect.Lead author Dr Eileen Luders, a neuroscientist from the University of Edinburgh, said: "We found that gender differences in brain structure were actually quite similar to those seen in human populations around the world."This means that it is not true that the human brain is very different from other mammals, but that it is a unique product of human evolution."It is possible that a more global trend of decreasing male dominance in modern societies may be affecting what we thought of as 'normal' as a result."As for the future, given the recent advances in neuroimaging research, we can envision that we may finally understand the differences between the sexes better, and how human brain evolution has affected the human condition."Dr Luders presented her research at the American Association for the Advancement of Science's annual meeting.Dr Raffaella Caserotti, an expert in the cognitive neuroscience of gender, from Loughborough University, said: "The research by Luders and coworkers adds to a growing body of evidence to provide the first comprehensive map of how brain size varies between cultures."The authors were able to do this because they have the same tools as other researchers, such as MRI scans, to analyse human brains from all over the world, and since they used MRI to show that males and females had similar brain sizes and structure, they are able to show the same thing in other groups."The study involved analysing MRI scans from more than 4,000 people around the world to see if they have the same or different brain structures.It found that men and women generally have roughly the same amount of grey matter in the areas of the brain associated with language, planning, memory, sensory perception and language.However, there were some major differences between males and females, particularly for people who use both speech and language.When it comes to using speech, males have less grey matter in their left frontal lobes, while females have more grey matter in their right frontal lobes.The researchers also found significant difference when it comes to the areas associated with visual perception. Men had smaller parts of these lobes, while women had larger areas of the brain.Dr Luders said: "Although other studies had found sex differences between the areas of the brain responsible for processing auditory and visual information, our research demonstrates that, surprisingly, the brain's differentially scaled areas and structures are equally evident in males and females in all cultures."She said the finding is likely to explain the widespread belief that the adult brain is more masculinised in males compared to females.Dr Caserotti from Loughborough University added: "This new information adds to a growing body of evidence for a more global trend towards a narrowing of what has previously been seen as a standard male and female brain."Other recent brain research revealed that men and women seem to have quite different brain wiring to one another. In 2015, researchers found that men and women have different patterns of connectivity in their brain. One of the main findings was that women's brains connect in more 'connections', while men have stronger connections.The research, published in the journal PLOS ONE, suggested that females are less likely to connect 'nodes' within areas they've never heard of, whereas males are more likely to connect up nodes in areas that are familiar to them.The study of the human sex differences on the brain was carried out by researchers from New York University and Stanford University based out of the United States.

A group calling itself the Islamic State in the Arabian Peninsula has beheaded a Yemeni man who was seen as an important figure in Sunni Islam.The extremist group posted the video of the killing on a militant forum used by the Nusra Front, Al Qaeda's affiliate in Syria.Saleh al-Qadhi was filmed earlier this week in the desert city of Hajjah, before the group's leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, declared the creation of an Islamic caliphate stretching across much of the Middle East and parts of Africa.Qadhi was identified by the U.S. State Department as one of the leaders for Yemen's southern Haditha province.The American gave himself up to authorities in Haditha province this year after being in the U.S. for seven years and reportedly was a member of the al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.The video shows Qadhi saying he had no choice but to give himself up because IS would kill him if he did not do so."This is my place of living, my family, my faith, my family and my place of my martyrdom, and the sword will not separate me from it," he said.The video is the third released by the Sunni militant group since al-Baghdadi announced the caliphate. There have been five other videos showing the beheading of captives but the first one to appear online does not feature Qadhi.The killing comes two days before U.S. President Barack Obama meets with Gulf leaders in Riyadh. He is expected to urge Arab nations to take collective action against extremists.The killing of Qadhi, a prominent cleric with a large following in his hometown of Zinjibar in central Yemen, would seem unlikely to stop or prevent the group's gains.Yemen has been wracked by a civil war since 2014, fueled by a Saudi-led campaign that has backed the internationally recognized government against Shiite rebels who seized power in March 2014.The U.N. estimates that more than 6,100 people have been killed in four years of fighting.More than 90 percent of Yemen's 22 million people are estimated to have been displaced, the U.N. says.The death of Qadhi will fuel fears that the conflict is becoming a proxy war between Saudi Arabia, which backs the government in Sanaa, and Iran, which backs the rebels. The Houthis say they are fighting Iran's proxies.Saudi Arabia and Yemen are now locked in its worst crisis in decades in which a civil war has claimed the lives of more than 10,000 civilians, according to U.N. figures.The international community, particularly the U.S. which has led the fight against IS, has been increasingly concerned about a rise in extremist groups, particularly Al Qaeda affiliates in Yemen.The Saudi-led coalition has also been criticized for targeting civilians, the BBC reported.The Associated Press contributed to this report.
The government will bring into force its plan to decriminalise cannabis consumption in a bid to reduce the number of deaths among drug users and to cut the number of people jailed, Health Minister Simon Harris said on Friday.Cannabis will no longer be classed as a controlled substance under New Zealand's new drug laws, giving judges more discretion in sentencing, he said.Marijuana (Photo: supplied)"It means, in effect, that the maximum time that can be given to those currently in prison for offences associated with possession and use of cannabis or cannabis preparations will be increased."This means that prison sentences will be more proportionate and the sentences will be more effective for less serious offences," Harris said.As part of the plan, the government will also abolish the maximum 18-month jail term in court if somebody was caught with cannabis for the first time and used it only once.Harris said the aim was not to criminalise people for cannabis use but to get them off the streets and out of court.Harris said the Ministry of Health and the police, as well as the legal profession, support the plan.The move, made after years of work under minister Helen Clark, is the largest overhaul of the country's drug laws in 20 years.The move will be announced by Labour leader Andrew Little at a press conference on Friday morning.Under the measures, all cannabis use in New Zealand is now legal.The maximum penalty, a fine or imprisonment, will be lifted on March 1 next year for people who are at least 19 years old and have not been in court on a cannabis charge for at least 12 months.New Zealand is the only country in the world to have decriminalised possession and the only country to have gone as far as to decriminalise drug use for the whole population – not just those aged between 18 and 25 with prior charges of cannabis use in a court of law.The move to decriminalise cannabis use is expected to save the government $1.6 billion per year, Harris said today.Justice Minister Amy Adams said there would be new penalties and the penalties that apply can now be changed.There will be a significant increase in the number of police and prison resources dedicated to these issues if the rules are properly implemented.Adams said it would be a mistake for New Zealand to move "away from our legal regime where we should continue to treat cannabis as a public health issue with the harm that it can cause, especially to young people".The government is also considering the introduction of other measures to tackle the drug in addition to the decriminalisation."One of the proposals would see a small proportion of people convicted of cannabis-related offences who are already serving sentences for other public order offences be sentenced to an additional minimum of 12 months in jail for each offence in which they were convicted as a result of a cannabis-related offence committed since they got out of prison," Adams said.Adams said she wanted to make sure that the law reflected the reality of cannabis use and possession in New Zealand today.She said the "target" for cannabis use is 1.3 million people, far less than the 12 million people who use tobacco every year.
When I saw that a group of American tourists were taking pictures of their shoes, I felt like I was walking through the backwoods of Louisiana. It wasn't until I realized that their shoes were almost always made of cotton that the "Oh hell no" reaction set in. I know that their shoes are not made of cotton, but what other words do you need to know?One of my friends from the Philippines, who works in an English-speaking school, wrote in describing an experience of this kind to me. She said that most of the kids in her school use the word to describe their shoes, but they usually leave it out when addressing their own feet. "To speak of your toes, or of the heels of your foot, is a sign of shame." If you're in the Philippines, the phrase usually makes you feel like you're part of a different species.AdvertisementPerhaps you already have an idea of what that means."The word 'shame' is often used as a polite way of saying 'not cool.' It's a way to get back at someone who hasn't gotten the message—especially an outsider, since it's quite an insult to try and say 'hey, I'm from your culture/race' and have it actually come out right."She went on to say that for some reason, she thinks she's always had a thing for these type of shoes. She calls them "totally made of cotton." She was even looking for something that looked like an American shoe, but just wouldn't fit. Of course, she still wants to use them.Advertisement"I can't speak for the rest of the foreign students around me, but I could never tell you how many times I've worn a pair of these jeans and then thought to myself, 'what's wrong with these shoes? I'm an American and I wear these,' and then I thought something completely different."And that's the thing: these shoes are completely made of cotton. Cotton's a plant. Maybe in some places it has been grown to have a high cotton content, perhaps some of us have actually walked in cotton fields with these. But even if they were cultivated in a place where the cotton has been grown to be a good quality, which it won't, that doesn't mean that it's completely made out of cotton. The cotton that ends up making the products that we buy are different, and they do not look like cotton at all. They have the quality and the smell of a different cotton, and it takes a certain type of person to know that, because of our lack of exposure to those types of shoes in our daily lives.I've spoken to several students who said that they really are afraid to say the words "made of cotton," because they don't want to feel as if they're embarrassing themselves. I also talked to two girls who said they didn't even know there were different types of cotton. They really don't get why they would want to say that these shoes are "faux-cotton" if the majority of the shoes they wear are actually made out of some kind of natural fiber, even if it is cotton.AdvertisementMost of us wouldn't have said something like that even if the shoes were made of cotton, but because they're not, these students have the power to really shape the world of shoe-buying in the Philippines.I asked a few of my American friends in the Philippines what they thought about the use of the word "shame" and they said that they didn't actually know where their shoes came from, but that they were "shocked."But I told my friends that I've been around plenty of places that are shamed. And I wondered, how did they know we were all shamed?
The New York TimesI had a good run.From the time I ran for mayor of New York City six years ago — when I ran as a populist and a radical, calling for a city where every woman held a top-level job, a city where every child could go to decent public schools, a city where children and families were treated as more than a budget balance, and a city that built great schools, community centers, public housing, affordable housing, and job training for New Yorkers of all backgrounds — we had the most vibrant young and vibrant Latino population, the deepest and best-organized working class, and a vibrant Muslim community. And we made enormous progress.But the job is not done. Our city is much too racially divided. Our budget is too huge. Our transportation system is too broken. Our schools are not keeping up. The gap between rich and poor is too wide. As a city, we remain under-served by police, by fire and by education.So I take stock. In addition to taking more personal responsibility for the things we can do, I plan to get even more ambitious: I will put forward a plan for the citywide creation of a task force — like a commission or a government-wide task force — to take a hard look at the problems and take concrete action. I will also have a task force on homelessness.So, after a decade of running for mayor of the most diverse and most prosperous big city in the country, I don't have high hopes for success.But I've learned that change can happen. And it's better today than it was when I came here in 2005. So I'm ready to go to work.AdvertisementThe New York TimesLet's look back, shall we?I can't remember a time of better times. The economy was booming: We had over 300,000 new jobs, the unemployment rate had dropped to 2.7 percent, and home values were booming. New homes were being built; the number of renter households was rising.I remember standing on Fifth Avenue with the people of Brooklyn and Queens watching the skyrocketing rent rates they were seeing. I know from talking to people in housing projects, low-income apartment complexes, and churches that rent is a struggle for people in this city.I remember when I was still in my 20s working three jobs and struggling with housing issues, and when I was running — a city where housing conditions were terrible and there were no new homes being built and where a new city council member from Brooklyn would have to walk from his house to the public safety building on Fifth Avenue in order to get to work.I remember running, campaigning for my first full term, in an election where turnout was at only 38 percent. And what really got me was listening to people I'd met in my first campaign, many from the neighborhood with the most problems.I remember when I talked to people, I was standing in the lobby of a hotel on Lexington Avenue, and I asked a group of young people to help me move one of their desks. They said, "We can't do that!" I said, but your life depends on it. And they couldn't believe it. They just couldn't believe it.I remember when I ran for mayor, with only a few days to go, and I was having breakfast at two different spots — one was at La Boulange — when the young woman who helped to make my food came up with a brilliant idea: We should have one place where we could all grab a bite to eat at 8 o'clock in the morning.I remember when I was running for the mayor's office, and someone called to say that I had won the Hispanic endorsement. It was a remarkable achievement for a candidate with so little political experience.I remember when I was running for the executive office of New York City, and I walked into the office of one of my supporters — a very bright and dedicated young man who had already worked on my presidential campaign in Miami — and asked him, "Can I come over for a few minutes and talk to your kids in the living room?"I remember how in my first inaugural in Brooklyn, a young man from a low-income community came and told me, "The first thing I want to do is to hug my mother and father." I told him, "Well, I think I've seen what a hug feels like, but I think I can handle it."I love you son," he said. "Go hug your mom."The New York Times
A new video released by the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) group shows militants throwing dozens of children into a river after a suicide bomber blew himself up in a mosque in Mosul, Iraq, killing at least 20 men attending prayers in a town about 60 miles away.At the center of the video is one man, an Iraqi jihadist who claims to be a former member of Iraq's military police but is not identified by name. On his shoulders is a white flag that depicts the black skull and black wings of ISIS, which says its aim is to bring about a black caliphate to rule over all Muslims.The man says in the video:"I was a member of the Iraqi security forces. We were protecting people from ISIS but we couldn't stop them," the video narrator said. "I was forced into hiding, not because I was a traitor but because I had a son in the Iraqi army. I can no longer stay because I have no power to protect him and his father. I do have power to defend my people because I am the Imam of the people of Mosul."In a second video that the ISIS group released Wednesday, a fighter with the group said that there would be "a lot more killings" in Iraq."We have just finished a week of operations in the areas of Nineveh and Salahuddin provinces," said the jihadi, using a common name for Mosul and neighboring Nineveh provinces.He told viewers that "We did a lot of killings because many people are being killed," according to The Associated Press.This video is the first time ISIS has released a video showing the mass beheading of captives. In the videos that have been released from the group's Iraq holdings this year, the militants have shown the killings by ISIS of members of the Iraqi security forces they captured.In 2014, ISIS killed more than 200 people — mostly captured Iraqi soldiers who had surrendered — in a series of mass beheadings, according to the Iraq Body Count Project, which tracks executions carried out by the group.The Associated Press contributed to this report.
An online petition calling on YouTube to remove videos by the hate group Islamic State continues to rack up signatures, with more than 3.4 million as of Thursday afternoon.The "I Don't Like the New World Order" (IDONETWN) petition calls on the social media video-sharing site to remove the Islamic State's "depictions of 9/11, violence, and the murder of Muslims in the video 'The Innocence of Muslims.' ""The content of this video is hate speech directed at all Americans," the petition says. "This content is being widely disseminated online, and we hope that YouTube will take immediate action to remove this content."In response, a YouTube spokesperson told ABC News that it "does not tolerate terrorist content and removes videos which violate our terms of service."In the three-minute video, the Islamic State is mocked as the "new Pharaoh" who rules over Muslims and Jews after taking over their land.While the video's description, which says it is "a film by the Islamic State depicting events in the life of Muhammad from 632 until 661 A.D.," leaves the door open for legal interpretation, the video is clearly inflammatory and likely in violation of YouTube's policy. The video's description includes the following:This video is a response to the crusaders who have waged a war against Muslims for 30 years. These crusaders have killed, oppressed and displaced millions of Muslims and others. The West is not ready for Islam. Therefore, the Islamic State will continue to bring you crusaders. You will be treated as the enemy at your own place; you will be slaughtered in your own land.On Thursday, the "I Don't Like the New World Order" petition had attracted just under 4.2 million signatures.As reported by ABC News:
As he walks to work at a big box store in St. Petersburg, Vladimir Karpov sees a man, a man in a suit, and another man walking to work down the street behind him.He says the uniformed workers look nervous. His boss later talks to Karpov about an elderly man who suddenly went missing. The man has never been seen again.Karpov says he saw a lot of strange things as he drove up and down the peninsula, but when he saw the missing man, "that was strange, man, you know."Karpov, who has been a truck driver at a big box store since 1977, is retired, and says he wants to be home with his family.But, he says, his job is to make money for his boss, so he must take it.The man he saw wasn't taking his job.When a man disappearedMakhmud Talaat, 65, was a member of the same neighborhood social club and a devout Muslim who prayed at the same mosque. He left home Thursday to visit his granddaughter at school. But two weeks ago, he disappeared. He never came back.Talaat's relatives and friends have wondered if he was the victim of a targeted attack. If so, it wasn't done on an isolated area. The suspect seemed to target someone who already had the misfortune of dying young on the peninsula, and not someone who would make a claim on a body, Talaat's family said.A few days after Talaat vanished, someone called the mosque in Alabino, one of the neighborhood's most popular Islamic centers with about 40 to 50 members. The mosque members got together and sent police with a list of Talaat's relatives, friends and coworkers.But police believe Talaat was killed somewhere else, because Talaat's wallet and identification were found about a one-mile distance from his house. No body parts. No blood stains. No indication his remains had been subjected to violent death.Talaat's disappearance has caused anger and frustration in the neighborhood. One man in the community, Muhammad, was a leader of a community group aimed at helping the mentally ill. He's a heavy smoker and uses a walking stick, but he now believes his own life was spared because he was Muslim, he said.He says his own children, who are Muslim, were sent to a school away from the neighborhood, and if they were killed, they could have blamed it on a hate crime. He says that no one even knows what the suspect was doing on the peninsula. He says he thinks the family is being targeted because it's Muslim.Muslim leaders tell a different story.In a written statement, the mosque says it has "no knowledge" of any "person of interest" in the case nor of any Muslim in Alabino or St. Petersburg being targeted in "any way."'People say we're crazy'In the neighborhood, one neighbor thinks it's ridiculous that no one has stepped forward to help the family. She says she can't believe they don't know what happened to Talaat."We don't know what the motive is," said the woman who asked not to be named. "People say we're crazy people. But why should a Muslim be killed in the neighborhood for that?"When reporters asked the woman how her neighborhood could be so different now, she replied, "Now I'm thinking the problem is more than us."
This morning, the first day of the week-long G20 summit in Hamburg, I made a stop at the main train station (Uebersee) in Berlin, one of the few in Germany with an airport that serves international rail service. (There's also one in Zurich, but that only serves the city's inner city.)Berlin is the capital of West Germany. It is also the largest city in the country. From where I landed, I couldn't help but feel the power of that distinction.The city's skyline is a sprawling mass of concrete and glass, and the whole thing comes to life at night. My view of the capital today was very different from what I was used to — and indeed, what I had heard about.I was standing in line for the DHL express (a very fast, cheap international transport service that connects more than 35 major German cities, and takes about 2 hours to travel), and looking at the long lines of people as they waited and waited to board a train of people I had never heard of before.I felt nervous, but not so nervous that I had to stop and get off the train. A few times people tried to talk to me, but I never took the bait. The feeling I got was one of sheer boredom, and of looking at people waiting in a line that had been there for quite some time."We're going to Hamburg in a few hours, but there's a lot of line-jumping around here!""We need to see this, even though it is in Germany!"A few hours after I left, the bus I'd booked with the express ended up taking me to Hamburg. It took me around 20-25 minutes to get there. When I got on board, the first thing I noticed would be the smell of the city that I had no previous experience in.There was something in the air, though. It wasn't that I had suddenly been given new knowledge of Hamburg. Instead, it smelled like a giant food court, with a few different stalls selling food, drinks and candy.It reminded me of the first time I visited an Indian food court in New York, and found that the food sold at that space was not the familiar Indian fare we see at most food courts, or at the upscale American Indian restaurants in India.After a few more hours on a crowded bus, I made it to what will be the main venue to hear Prime Minister Obama speak. This is a new, completely refurbished area — it's been completely revamped since the last summit there in 2009.The large conference floor has several large meeting rooms (where the prime minister will attend), as well as smaller meeting rooms with more intimate seating.This is where the speeches will be, and it also has several auditoria, with rows of speakers in front of large picture windows, and tables to place things.It's hard to tell exactly where in the room Obama's speech will take place, but it will likely be in front of the large picture windows in the center of the auditoria, and it likely will feature a question-and-answer portion with participants around him.I had my camera around me a lot, trying to get shots of him talking. On any given day, I may be standing at a different spot from thousands of people behind me, and I will only be able to see a few flashes of images that are shot for a day after the event, but for me, it meant a great deal. That's how it was when I visited the G20 Summit in 2010.
An open letter to the U.S. and other world leadersDear President Obama and Foreign Minister Kerry, I was greatly pleased by your June 21 speech at the UN Human Rights Council, in which you outlined your commitment, as president and prime minister of the United States, to promoting and protecting human rights around the world. At a time when human rights are being threatened on an unprecedented scale and with impunity by the U.S. government, I was particularly pleased that you made the following clear:As the leader of a global alliance, the United States will never tolerate a new human rights record, and is prepared to hold those responsible to account.The international community must ensure this commitment translates into concrete steps to improve human rights in the United States. I can only hope that our response to Russia's actions in Ukraine demonstrates the seriousness with which we take this matter.When it is necessary, the U.S. government will stand with its allies if that is what it takes to bring about true change. Indeed, the United States is prepared to take those actions. This is why we have begun a broad review of our security co-ordination with our allies – including Australia, Canada, and New Zealand.While there are other important issues between this nation, including our enduring alliance with Israel, our relations with Russia must define our diplomatic relationship. That's why, in recent days, I have been in contact with Foreign Minister Kerry and with President Putin, working as we speak to ensure that Russia meets its commitments to the Minsk agreements which aim to end the conflict.This is not the first time our foreign policy has been threatened with isolation or decline on this issue by the United States. In 2010, just three months after the U.S. election, the Foreign Minister Kerry took his nation's foreign relations into his own hands by calling Russia's military action in the Ukraine an assault on the sovereignty, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine and urging the Russian president to pull back from that aggression. It was a watershed event for him, and for this nation. As Foreign Minister Kerry said at the time, "The Russians are clearly testing America's resolve. . . . If Russia has decided that it is in the best interests of its own security to intervene, that is a breach of international law. . . . That has consequences."Since then, we have made a determined effort to work directly with Russia to resolve this problem. The work of the U.S. State Department and the Departments of Defense, Energy, Treasury, Treasury-Commerce, and Justice has been tremendous, and the United States has worked closely with our allies, including Australia, Canada and New Zealand, in helping to reach a solution through direct talks between Ukraine and Russia.The United States will continue to stand with its friends and allies to protect the rights of all countries, including the rights of those who desire to move the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. That will not change. However, as a nation that recognizes the historic importance of Jerusalem as the undivided capital of the State of Israel, the United States has not and will not recognize Russia's claims to this holy and historic city. That is where this issue stands.The president and vice-president have expressed their commitment to a peaceful solutions to this conflict and have indicated that they expect the Russians to follow through with that commitment. The U.S. government also hopes that a solution will be reached in this case, because the status of Jerusalem is a matter that is of deep significance to the future of the State of Israel and there is no legitimate basis for Russia to insist on changing the status of the city as claimed by the Jewish people for thousands of years. I believe that is a matter for negotiation. But for now the focus is on trying to get the parties to come together and find a way forward. And that is what this administration is committed to doing.Now you do find it interesting that the administration has chosen not to have a national security meeting prior to that point and that President Bill Clinton held a meeting on Monday to discuss the international response to Russia's actions in Ukraine. Now, as you know, there are two possibilities: either Mr. Putin believes it is a good idea to violate international law by conducting a military operation against the country of his allies and friends in the Ukraine, or he has a lot less confidence in a U.S. president that he can work together to achieve a lasting settlement in Ukrainian matters. The question is whether or not that is the choice that the Russian government has chosen to make.I wish it were otherwise. I think at this point in time there is no other course for resolving this issue. There are simply no easy diplomatic options and there is no excuse for taking the options off the table.If Russia doesn't want to accept the facts, then in a manner of speaking, the United Nations, acting under its own authority, needs to accept the facts. As I have said
The White House and the State Department have not responded to questions from BuzzFeed News over whether Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, when he was CEO of ExxonMobile, tried to block a sanctions plan that would have hit Moscow with a "haircut" when he headed the US energy giant in the 2000s.The report comes as President Donald Trump's White House faces scrutiny from Capitol Hill over a variety of issues.A spokeswoman for Tillerson denied any pressure on government officials to take steps to ease the sanctions, which have been blamed for contributing to the deaths of American diplomats in Moscow, and the alleged meddling of the Russian government into the 2016 election. The spokeswoman has said that Tillerson is committed to lifting the sanctions.But a senior State Department official — who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak about the matter publicly — confirmed that Tillerson pushed the department to change Exxon's stance on sanctions in 2011, after a Russian deputy prime minister announced that the company had decided to stop investing in Russia.The sanctions were later finalized in 2012 with the help of Congress and the Obama administration, but Exxon was not required under the sanctions to disclose the decision in its annual report to the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company eventually did, and on April 4, 2013, the company wrote a letter to the Treasury Department saying it had decided to put that sanctions relief on hold.The department's letter to Exxon came after the Russian energy giant decided to return to investing in Russia — this time without the need for a sanctions agreement. The Treasury statement gave the company 10 workable months, until December 2013, to get a renewal of sanctions waivers for its oil and gas sector.A State Department official confirmed that State Department lawyers met with Exxon's attorney, who was trying to convince the agency to reconsider its position on a sanctions waiver, after Exxon informed Treasury Department officials that they were changing their stance. But the official would not say precisely what the lawyers said."When we decided we would make the decision to pursue sanctions relief, there was a discussion and a review process in which all relevant parties were involved; we made our decision, and I think it became very clear very early on that it was not going to move if we didn't have a waiver," the official said.The official said that officials at Treasury are required to look at the facts and the law in determining whether to grant waivers. "It's not like if you're an oil company, you just come into the administration because you want this waiver or that waiver. There has to be a nexus between sanctions relief and the company, and that's why we're reviewing the waivers going back to 2002. It's not that if you're an oil company [you] want this and that, you just come in and say, 'I need this waiver because of my business model,'" the official said.The State Department official also denied that Tillerson, through the company that bears his name, tried to block sanctions. ExxonMobil's 2013 annual reporting to the SEC includes a statement that Tillerson's office, as chief executive for the previous five years, urged "refraining from further exploration into, and investments in, Russian resources." Tillerson's spokesman, R.C. Hammond, said he could not confirm that his boss had pushed State to reconsider sanctions in any way.Rep. Ed Royce, the Republican chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, in a statement described Tillerson as "unfit" to hold the office of secretary of state. He said that Tillerson's "history of pushing the interests of ExxonMobil before America's best interests are served as a result of American foreign policy is deeply troubling and, once again, proves the Trump administration has no real plans behind some of its most important foreign policy decisions so far."A spokesman for the committee did not respond to a request for comment.The Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which has oversight over the State Department, also asked the FBI on Thursday to investigate whether ExxonMobil acted appropriately in its 2012 sanctions application. Senate staff and lawyers for the committee's chairman said they received a response from ExxonMobil on Monday that concluded the company didn't alter its report to avoid sanctions.Asked about the FBI's request on Thursday, a State Department spokesman declined to comment — saying the FBI, a department unit that investigates possible crimes committed by US citizens abroad, has no role in reviewing its filings or determining what, if anything, is a violation.According to the Treasury Department's 2012 sanctions statement, Exxon declined to issue a waiver, since the sanctions in place could be lifted by December 2012. The Russian government, at the time, had made its own request for sanctions waivers, but the administration rejected that proposal, said the Treasury official, who requested anonymity because he wasn't authorized to speak about the matter publicly. "By the time Exxon was prepared to consider it, sanctions had been reimposed and sanctions waivers had been revoked," the official said.The Treasury official also said that Tillerson wanted the sanctions cut
The most important thing about The Avengers is that it made Robert Downey Jr. into an action hero. The same thing happened to Chris Evans when he became an Avenger. It's a credit to Joss Whedon that he used the ability to play up his physicality and charisma as an actor as well as his considerable talent as a filmmaker.While Evans may be playing a superhero, it's his co-stars who are the true heroes of the piece. It was Evans who brought down HYDRA. The Scarlet Witch was the most surprising character to make her big screen debut yet and she worked as a major motivation to bring down another of the most sinister villains in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.But while we were watching Captain America take down the baddest villain in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, one other super hero stole the show. His name is Chris Hemsworth and he's been making his mark on the action scene while still being the best thing ever to happen, Thor.You know that Thor has one huge weakness. He doesn't eat much. But there was one scene in The Avengers where he did eat and he looked like he just really wanted to. And I think we can safely say the man has an appetite. Thor's not a superhero who can be trusted by the general populace to just make sure they're safe from danger. Thor is a god. Thor has a mission to be on top of everything. It's his task, and it's really his responsibility. The second Thor is done on the battlefield, he just returns home to Asgard. This character is not for the faint of heart, which makes his appearance in The Avengers pretty awesome.A lot of people were surprised how quickly Thor took down HYDRA leader Baron Wolfgang Von Strucker but let's face it, Thor is a lot more powerful than the Baron. It was only a matter of time before Thor was going to put their heads together and save the day. And guess what happens when Thor and Thor's wife run into each other?The Avengers might have taken down HYDRA, but they definitely helped get some people some new jobs.Captain America makes a decision to put together his secret Avengers team in the wake of the events of The Avengers, and the next day one of his people is doing a little job clearing out some trash at the local dump. If you've not seen The Avengers, you might not be aware that Steve Rogers is a former Nazi named Steve Rogers. He turned himself in after the war and was welcomed back to the United States. While his past isn't easy to forgive, it does make him a strong and honest member of his Avengers team and it'll be sad to see him go anytime soon. That's why a little bit of a reminder that he once was a Nazi is always welcome when it comes time for Steve to help out.One of the reasons I thought this was a great scene was because of how believable it was. The Nazis and the Avengers are two very different groups with different ideologies.That's one of the reasons why I love the movie more and more, even if I can watch some of it on TV. If I'd heard that a man who hated my country was helping fight a war that would eventually help end his country's existence, I wouldn't have been too surprised.So don't let the fact that I enjoy it on TV prevent you from getting the movie. It's just too good.Share this: FacebookTwitterTumblrRedditGooglePinterestLike this: Like Loading...

For the first time since 2008, one person who was originally named in the WikiLeaks release of hacked DNC emails has been confirmed to have actually been in the DNC payroll.Interested in DNC Leak? Add DNC Leak as an interest to stay up to date on the latest DNC Leak news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add InterestOn Thursday, a source confirmed to ABC News that John McFarland was in the DNC payroll in the spring and summer of 2016, as was Thomas Perez.McFarland, who was a speechwriter when he left the Obama administration in 2014, was named by hackers in a leak of emails from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which were released by Wikileaks this week.DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz also did not publicly address his role on the DNC payroll, though she did not immediately return ABC News' request for comment.McFarland has not denied the Wikileaks allegation, telling ABC News that he was "in and out of the system" and that he had "zero" impact on the election for Wasserman Schultz, who was forced to resign as DNC chair in the aftermath of the leak, though WikiLeaks has not officially offered its explanation as to why it named McFarland.ABC News' Jack Date contributed to this report.
LANSING, MI — The Michigan Court of Appeals reversed last week the conviction of a woman accused of fatally shooting her boyfriend because the case hinged on the definition of a weapon."This is no longer an open question," writes Judge James R. Brown in reversing an August decision by Lansing Circuit Court Judge Christopher Kratz.After an eight-day bench trial, Kratz found Kristie Ann Kopp had shown enough evidence that her handgun was an intentionally lethal weapon, a standard the state's court system applies in capital cases. Brown, who presided over the trial, wrote he was struck "by how well" the state's evidence had established its case from the beginning."It did not do so only with a handful of witnesses and a few exhibits," Brown writes. "As a result, Kopp's jury could see the evidence presented, hear the testimony of those witnesses, see the expert witnesses, and arrive at its verdict quickly and decisively."Catherine Johnson, 45, was convicted last September of second-degree murder in the Sept. 5, 2013, shooting during a domestic violence incident at Kristie Ann Kopp's home in Leland. Johnson shot her boyfriend Michael Edward Smith four times with Kristie Ann Kopp's .38-caliber Taurus Judge revolver.After the fatal shooting, Michael Edward Smith was flown back to Grand Rapids. He died at St. Joseph's Hospital, where he and Kristie Ann Kopp had known each other since they were in high school.Johnson had admitted to police that she shot her boyfriend with Smith's own gun after an argument in their basement, an allegation she maintained for weeks following the trial. She also testified that she was not certain she had fired the gun at Smith, according to court records.At the time of that shooting, Catherine Johnson told police she had left the gun inside the kitchen sink as she went to clean it."She then proceeded to clean the gun by submerging it in the sink, but she then discovered the gun was missing," according to a trial transcript. "She thought it might be on the counter, so she looked in the sink. She found it on the counter."Johnson's trial lawyer, Jennifer Churack, told MLive Michigan that her client accepted the verdict after prosecutors called three separate mental health professionals to testify."She accepted and accepted the fact she did the wrong thing and she's going to pay for it," Churack said.Kopp argued the evidence presented at the trial showed she did not intend to kill her partner. She said she had recently moved to Southern California, where she said her estranged husband was living, where she was not engaged.Prosecutors argued that even though Catherine Johnson said she did not intend to kill Michael Smith, she was guilty by reason of being present when she shot him and that she knew she had the gun was not allowed under state law.Michigan law defines a weapon as any object with "an electric or mechanical trigger," including a handgun. Kopp argued her firearm was not an object with a mechanical trigger, meaning the jury could consider it as an intentionally lethal weapon because she deliberately fired a gun."(The defendant's) deliberate intent does not require her to have an intent to kill. (Instead) her deliberate intent could be to shoot someone else, because that is what she intended to do," argues Kratz. "If that's what she intended to do, she could lawfully have shot and caused the death of a third party."Defense arguments to the contrary also failed to convince the jury, according to the opinion.Michael Smith's family, who was present at the trial for most of the trial, also testified that even though he did not attend the crime scene, he had been in the residence for several hours prior to Catherine Johnson's arrival.One witness, Patricia Kocher, told the court she lived in the upstairs bedroom at the Leland residence where Michael was shot through the window that faces down the alley."I heard her yell that she was going to shoot him, and when she shot him, he was on the floor," Kocher said of Johnson.On cross-examination, the defense argued Michael Smith was unarmed and that Catherine Johnson knew he was unarmed."He wasn't holding a pen, he wasn't holding a cell phone," Kocher said. "This is a man who was not armed, in a place he was not known to go."Another neighbor testified that she saw her neighbor's daughter, also by Michael Smith, coming home from school at 10:30 a.m., and that she and Michael Smith were involved in a fist fight at about 11:30 a.m. that night."(The defendant) said, 'We didn't fight.' That's when my neighbor asked 'What happened? Where is she?'" testified Barbara Koss, who
I love my first-person shooter, but there were times when I would get frustrated with the poor gameplay. That's not too much of a problem, though. The game gets you to where you want to be quickly, and it is simple to play. If you ever want to step back and think about what made this game great to begin with, you'll know the keys to it.Here are four things:You need to have to know how to read your surroundings, particularly the world map. I don't mean to sound like my advice is the only way to play, but you need to know where the action is. For example, if you're in a large room full of enemies and you hear them walk into the direction of the sound source, you should look around it. You don't want to be shooting one enemy and then another coming toward you at the exact same time.You need to know when to move around and when to stay put. A great many shooters give you a set amount of ammunition to take down enemies, but you must remember not to hold all your ammo before going to the restroom or taking a bathroom break; you MUST be ready to handle any enemy that comes knocking at your door.And, finally, you need to know how to get out of the heat of battle and start a new one. You have to constantly choose your tactics. You have to know when enemies are close enough to be a threat and when they're not. You have to know when to move through thick crowd and when to move to a clear path. You have to know who and when the enemy will show up from your direction.These are things that are easy to pick up, but they are hard to master. Thankfully there are plenty of videos on YouTube, websites and books to help you get your bearings. The video above shows you the basic movement around levels, and even gives you an overview of how to kill every enemy type you can.Of course you'll learn more by playing, but some of the best weapons out there have no words on them.
The best of a number of new "breather dives" planned for the South Australian capital will come in the form of a raft of events, from community walks and food stalls to cultural activities to the launch of a bicycle-sharing scheme.Events planned for Adelaide's CBD, as well as the outskirts, will include a community day of "street life" in the centre on March 14, the city's first Bike Week, on April 18-22 and the launch of the city's first public bike-sharing system on May 12."What Adelaide has demonstrated is that there is a very large demand for more sustainable, alternative modes of transport in the city," transport planning and development manager Peter Firth told the ABC."The city's population is going up and the public transport system is struggling to cope for the ever increasing demands associated with public transport."
By Jeff Ruch for NiskayunaBy Jeffrey Ruch for NiskayunaThe author would like to thank her editor, Nitza Mankin, and to all colleagues for their support and encouragement.The title of Robert C. O'Malley's book is the most important statement you'll make while listening to this podcast. You need to understand this book in order to fully appreciate what's in store.In other words, if you were going to choose from a menu of books on the topic of the environment in America, Robert C. O'Malley's book would be the first thing you'd take: "The Case Against Fossil Fuels is an epic exposé, one that takes on the Big Polluters, the global energy complex, and the political-economic powers that be," O'Malley writes. "It was published, just a couple of weeks ago, on July 28, to much excitement and high hopes."O'Malley goes through the entire history of America's energy sector, from its origins in the American west to the oil industry that we know today: the hydraulic fracturing ("fracking") and tar sands extraction that continue to cause environmental devastation that is still being done today.Throughout the book, O'Malley takes you from the beginnings of the oil industry to the present day. In the process, O'Malley not only lays out a clear vision for how the energy sector can change the course of American history, but also describes a number of solutions.You might ask yourself, "I think the world will never be the same after reading this book." The world's population is increasing exponentially due to an increase in the world's human population (that we're aware of in fact), and the human population is not evenly distributed geographically. There is more room for the world's richest countries to grow and spread out around the world instead of being so isolated, which means more room for our planet to expand and grow into a completely sustainable and habitable place.O'Malley's book starts with an early exploration of the energy industry in America and the role it played in American history and society. In 1790, the United States was just beginning to emerge from colonization and was a country with just one state, Virginia, with a large and wealthy population. Coal, which was one of the more valuable commodities available at the time, was mined in the Shenandoah Valley, a region of the Appalachian Mountains that stretches from West Virginia through the western part of West Virginia to Maryland.In the same way America has been developing over the last 200 years, the U.S. economy has also been growing exponentially. The economy grew more than 4.5 times between 1820 and 1880, for example. The 1820s and 30s was a time of great prosperity, particularly in the northeastern corner of the country, thanks to a huge increase in the number of railroad yards and telegraph poles."The growth was dramatic—there were two million jobs created in 1820 and another two million a decade later," said O'Malley in a discussion with Jeff Ruch on Niskayuna Community Radio this summer.But during the mid-19th century, the "business cycle" (that is, the natural, cyclical movements of the economy) slowed down. It was during this time that coal mining in the U.S. began to go downhill, thanks to cheap, plentiful natural gas that was being found in Ohio and the East. Oil was in the process of becoming more expensive, but still the U.S. remained the world's leader on oil production.O'Malley points out that before the industrial revolution, the economy was not a significant source of the national budget, but "in about 1880, the U.S. was the biggest source of the national budget. We used to get about $900 from the national budget for each of our workers."Fast forward to the turn of the century and the Great Depression took over the country. Between 1929 and 1933, the U.S. government cut its annual budget from $3 billion to $1.6 billion (or 0.7%).During the war years of World War II, however, the economy took a major hit. By 1945, the GDP in the U.S. was down to $1.8 billion (or 1.2 percent of the GDP of the United Kingdom at the time), a decrease of almost 25 percent.With the war out of the way and the country rebuilding after it, the U.S. economy continued to thrive. During the 1960s, the economy was growing at an annual rate of about 6 percent.Then in the late 1980s, the United States experienced a slowdown in GDP, and it's growth started plummeting at an annual rate of 2 percent in the 1990s.During this time, the American population started to drop. Between 1990 and 2000, the population of
In April 2014, the Supreme Court upheld Arizona's "show me your papers" law that prevents some undocumented immigrants, and later all of immigrants, who have not yet been in California for more than six months to get a driver's license or state identification card because they are here illegally.In June, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that the federal government could have taken away state money that states give to the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office for implementing the ID check program, even as the federal government did not stop issuing driver's licenses to undocumented immigrants and did not take them away.The state sued the DOJ and, among other things, said that the federal government should have stopped issuing ID cards from federal public funds and given the money to the state to implement the ID check program.The state was also demanding that the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel have to say whether it would uphold the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling.On Oct. 7, both the Justice Department and ACLU filed responses to state's suit, but in the latter lawsuit, the Justice Department does not provide a specific opinion on whether the federal government can stop issuing ID cards to undocumented immigrants from the funds that states give to them, so it is not a clear-cut case of federal usurping state law.Nevertheless, the ACLU also claims that a Supreme Court ruling would "exonerate the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office" and that "law enforcement officers have a serious choice" because a ruling in the state's favor would "impose an unconstitutional burden on law enforcement."In one of the government's responses, it is said that it would be a "major departure" from the opinion of Supreme Court to do away with the program because the state has no "good-faith reason" to continue with the program. Moreover, it is said that the federal government, not the state of Arizona, should have paid for the program's upkeep, which would still remain a question of state laws.In another part of the government's response, it is also said that since the state of Arizona has no "good-faith reason" to continue its state-sponsored program, it could not take money in the future from the federal government. As a result, it is said that the state would have to get a good-faith reason to continue the program.It is also said that the program should be scrapped in the future because it would violate one of the most important parts of the "federalist system of government, the separation of powers."Finally, it is said that since the federal government is not giving the money back to the state, the state can also be sued if it did not stop making ID checks at its borders and checkpoints and if it did not get a decent money for the program's upkeep.The lawsuit comes just last month and the Justice Department's response is only four pages in length.Arizona Governor Jan Brewer signed the ID check law in 2011 after she vetoed similar legislation that would have given more funding to the DOJ.In its response to the federal government, the state of Arizonans for Responsible Immigration Reform (ARIR) criticized the government's decision to not go through the appeals process.According to a copy of ARIR's response released by ACLU-Southern California, ARIR said that ARIR was "puzzled" by the government's decision but that it has asked for answers to its "hundred-plus questions" concerning the program from the Department of Justice.The Arizona-based group also noted that it is not a state because it has been under federal court injunctions and could be considered a litigant. Since ARIR is not a state as of its most recent filing, it will only be allowed to ask for answers from the DOJ.
From Dwarf Fortress WikiThis article is about an older version of DF.More InfoThere are many other tools with similar functionality to the trade depot. One good idea is to do all your mining and smelting outside of fortress mode. Doing all your production inside does add a lot more work and may result in being unable to keep up with your fortress's current output.The Trade Depot consists of an interior and an exterior.edit] InteriorThe Trade Depot cannot be built on a magma level and is thus built on an empty space. Inside the depot is a stockpile of goods. At least one stockpile should be placed outside of the depot due to the fact that trading is a risk. On embark you will often find yourself carrying several times the number of items you are likely to need, in the end it is more cost effective to bring some goods with you, when necessary.An example of what an interior is like with the contents of a workshop stockpiled near it.The depot is a big enough space that you can move your workshop or the smelting or extraction rooms into it.The contents of the depot are as follows:Lumber. The Lumber stockpile is placed near the depot, and you can use it to produce and stockpile wood. It can also be used to trade wood with other fortresses.MetalFood and drink. Food and drink stockpiles are placed near the Depot, and the food and drink are used by the depot for trading purposes. Note that food and drink in the Depot still need to be placed and brought to the Depot before they will be used.Weapons and armor. Weapons and armor stockpiles are placed near the Depot and can be used to make your fortress more formidable, in addition to your dwarves' current equipment.Cigar BoxesToolsThe Depot has a 1-tile-wide walkable space (or 10x10x10 room).edit] ExteriorThe Depot is built in the ground on the edge of a map square (this square can be a corner of one, two, or multiple squares). The Depot is always at the edge of a "fort" square, which may be a small square in a long wall of fortifications or possibly several walled fortresses.To dig out the Depot inside the map square:Dig out an area equal to 8 tiles by 8 tiles (e.g. an area of 6 by 6 by 6 tiles will give you an 8x6-tile square). Note the direction you want the Depot to be built. This may differ (although not much) from how the Depot appears on the surface to your fortress. You may dig diagonally up to get more room for your buildings. Build a 3x3-tile Depot inside this area. A depot is a 1-tile-wide space that can hold up to 16 stockpiles. However, the Depot is not necessarily built in a 1x1-tile space. Dig out an additional 1x1-tile area of the Depot to make room for your other buildings. Build stairs outside the Depot for access for your dwarves if required.A depot's "top floor" is the area above each stockpile that contains all the stockpile's objects.edit] TradingA dwarf can build a trade depot with a workshop but can only work inside the depot. The trade depot can be used to receive goods from one fortress to another in the current or previous game days. The dwarf will have zero work to do in-game days, even if you have no dwarf inside the Depot.Trading can be broken up into three stages: importing, exporting, and carrying goods from one fortress to another on the current or previous game day. In the process of importing or exporting goods from the depot, dwarves sometimes drop their items into the stockpiles of other dwarves or go to the Depot and pick up their lost items. A depot will not accept any items dropped from a dwarf that is on active duty.ImportTo import goods from another fortress to the depot (you are probably inside the Fortress Mode map, so you must have the trade route open).To import the goods to the depot, use a carpenter's workshop and a wagon to move the goods, placing them in the appropriate stockpile. You can set the direction of the wagon by moving the cursor to where you want it to go, but the wagon will attempt to go in any direction, even down diagonal roads (though the direction a wagon will go when it enters a diagonal road is determined by the direction it starts at). The wagon will stop if it runs into a stockpile, and if the wagon is carrying more than one item (including items in carts) then the wagon will try moving as quickly as possible. Any objects being transported by a wagon are pushed directly towards the wagon. If the depot accepts multiple items, then it
I was trying to work on a bit of a math problem. The problem was not a simple number problem, but rather a problem that required knowing the number of digits in a certain sequence. What I really needed was to know how many digits needed to be present for the algorithm to make the right decision.I knew how many digits were necessary, but I was also trying to determine why the algorithm made the specific choice that it did when it did choose that number. In other words I wanted a more general answer to what makes a rational numbers sequence a good decision, not just a question about the algorithm I was solving.The most straightforward means of going about this would be to get the exact sequence of digits needed, and then work backwards to figure out why the algorithm went that way. It is also possible, but much more time consuming, to actually calculate all the digits of the sequence in question, then find the answer, and then try it out. Both of these approaches are time consuming and tedious tasks, especially when they require memorizing the solution.So I went ahead and got the answer, then used it to figure out what made the algorithm go the way it did (not without a bit of time-wasting as well!).I'm going to explain how I did that, since my technique is pretty much identical to some techniques that people have used a bit in the past, but I'm not going to actually discuss that.How To Choose The Minimum Sequence Number To CountThe first step, in fact the most difficult step, is to figure out the minimum number of digits. This number is known as a minimal number of digit sequence to count. That is, the minimum number of digits is the smallest single digit sequence that can be the result of the algorithm if all the digits were available. That is, if each digit in the number is 0 or 1 depending on how you count, then the minimum number of digits would be the sum of the digits in these counts, times the size of the count.The idea is the smaller the count, the more digits it needs to have to make a correct decision. Thus, by reducing the number of digits is the number, you eliminate the amount of work required. Now, the algorithm actually did make the right decision based on how many digits were in the final digit, so I wasn't done.The next step is, again, to get an exact sequence count. The easiest way to do this is to first look exactly at the digits that make up the number, and then to take the square root of each digit. This count is the minimum count of digits that would ensure that the algorithm actually made the right choice. After doing this a few times, you know that in order to make the right decision, there needs to be at least this many digits in this sequence.However, to actually figure out exactly how many digits are in the sequence is an art. There are many algorithms that will give you an answer where the answer is exactly what you want, but not everyone is going to do exactly what your algorithm says. This is especially true when the algorithm doesn't say how many digits it wants, but the right answers come out anyway due to luck. For most people, they just have to make a best guess based on what the digits were actually used to build (not by what the algorithm tells you to do, even if that means some guess guess).How To Count The Minimum Sequence NumberThe only thing left to do is to go through this process a bunch of times and figure out how many sequences of digits to count in order to make the algorithm make the right decision, and if it's too much or not enough. Once you know how many digit sequences it requires to make the right decision, you're done! You can stop figuring out what sequence of digits it needs and can just look through the problem again. If the algorithm can always make the decision, then you need to be asking how many digits it needs.Now you have an example where each digit is not even possible to count without wasting too much time. It would have just been better for the problem to require no digits, or at least just 1 digit. But you have a starting sequence of digits, which is a really important first step. Now that you know how many digits are in the counting process, then you're going to do this process again for each digit in the counting sequence. You're going to find how many digits are required to get to each digit in the counting sequence without wasting too much time. You won't be able to guess the answer exactly due to chance, but that's not as important.For example, let's use the following sequence I created in an algorithm. If I want a minimum number of digits, I would have wanted 0,1-1,4,5 on the right, 0,1-2,3 on the left. By using the algorithm, I'll be able to figure out
I would say that what Trump did was "unpresidential." His refusal of "normal" responses to crisis-driven events, which include diplomacy, is a recipe for disaster. It's bad enough that he's incapable of doing that on his own, but also the manner in which he decided to undermine Tillerson. The secretary obviously had no intention of quitting; the resignation was his alone.Trump seems to have a lot of power in these matters. But he also has a lot of enemies. And some of them are within his own administration.On the day of Tillerson's departure, I wrote: "If Trump is truly concerned about the chaos caused by his constant firing of senior staff, then he must put his own senior aides in a position where they have to make tough calls—and if he doesn't he's going to lose his remaining leverage over the chaos.""If he doesn't" was exactly the way to put his people in that position, by ousting Tillerson in his own staff in his own party. If he were serious about the job, he wouldn't have done that. And since he clearly is not, he's a threat to democracy. You can't have a democratic system, with checks and balances, without checks and balances — even when you want to get tough with your enemies.As the New Yorker wrote:Trump now has his own "shadow Cabinet" of Cabinet secretaries – people who share key traits with him and whose only job is to do his agenda; who may or may not agree with his decisions; or, if they don't agree, to be his enforcers. At the moment, the key members of this Cabinet include Jared Kushner, the president's son-in law and now an advisor, whom Trump was said to have favored for the job of national-security adviser before he picked Tillerson; Reince Priebus, who replaced Priebus as senior counselor and now commands the press-bashing, White House-infuriating apparatus; and Gary Cohn, who is both Cohn and Jared's boss. In addition to these senior officials, Trump has also chosen a dozen individuals who have served as Trump allies in the campaign or administration but who appear to have no job in the Trump administration. They remain in their previous positions, which suggests little concern whatsoever for what their new boss might do or say.To take a hypothetical example:The administration is now considering deporting a group of roughly 800 people held by the D.C. jail system on "parole violations." Trump promised that those who had committed a crime, as with others, would not be allowed back into the U.S., but Sessions did not follow this pledge. This would be a very clear violation of a major campaign promise, on which Sessions is now serving in a crucial advisory role.Would Trump, or his lawyers, say, "We don't care about these people"? I would bet on the latter, and that his lawyers would argue, as they often have when under pressure from Trump, that because the policy is at his discretion and not Sessions's, Sessions may not enforce the rule.In addition to the cabinet appointees, we've had other leaks, some of them coming from within the administration, most of them damaging to Bannon. In August, the New York Times reported that Bannon was in conflict with National Economic Council director Gary Cohn over the administration's economic agenda; Bannon thought Cohn was a soft-on-China ideologue, with which he disagreed.Cohn later confirmed that the conflict was real in an interview with the Financial Times, explaining that he thought Bannon's criticism made the administration look stupid. After the August story came out, Trump tweeted in response, "Gary Cohn who is secretly working for China,bank on salaries of 200K", and Cohn responded by pointing out that he was only making $265,000 (the number of years Cohn's current contract lasts). Later in the campaign, Trump repeatedly called Cohn a "loser," so that's what he's becoming.Now, to the question of whether Trump has any legitimacy as a leader of the nation. On Friday, CNN's Fareed Zakaria noted that Trump has become the president of his own Twitter account:On Twitter, Trump has said things that no other President has said. His supporters love it, and the rest of the world hates it. At various moments, he has said that he believes Barack Obama was not born in the United States, and that he thinks President Obama may have been affiliated with the Islamic State. He's said that if Mexico sends its people to the United States, the United States will no longer honor a longstanding agreement that's keeping their country of origin from sending immigrants to the United States…. He used one of these lines: "I was the one that got him to do the 'New York Times' interview. I get to do the 'New York Times' interview, you can't do that. I'm the President of the United States. You

The vehicle itself is compatible with a wide variety of vehicle kits, but the cockpit and cab sections are not compatible with the majority of M.A.C. builds. This was done to keep the price down and to keep the kit compatible with a wide variety of different vehicle kits. It is also compatible with nearly all of our various Tamiya 1/35 scale vehicles.Due to our size, we do not generally offer our products for sale anywhere else on the internet. However, the majority of our models are available as "Kits" which are complete kits from the manufacturer.
C.O.D.O.M.S. C.O.D.O.M.S. SourceForge, an Open Source project.C.O.D.O.M.S. is a software component oriented framework for the creation of robust, easy to maintain and extendable GUI elements. It is an independent fork and port of C.O.D.O.J.A.W.S, a toolbox based GUI construction framework.Note: This project is based upon version 3.x of C.O.D.O.J.A.W.S.FeaturesSupport for graphical elements composed of many individual graphical classes and attributes, in addition to generic HTML objectsA graphical user interface is represented by a tree of child nodes in the DOM, each of which can have their own properties, attributes, and events. When one child node is clicked the entire tree is altered to display the event object and value of that childProperty names and attributes are case-sensitive and can have mixed case variants, unlike JSON.NET; C.O.D.O.M.S. uses snake_case as its default dictionary orderingCustom data structures are supported, via objects and objects of classes defined by the designer. Data classes supported by the toolbox can have any structure necessary to maintain GUI properties and events. Classes used in the creation of GUI elements and events should be defined in the main GUI file, usually a C# class file named GUI.cs. The Designer's code can access property and event data without regard to the actual class structure.Multiple layers are supportedEvent handlers provide a clean, declarative approach to creating events. Events can be bound to GUI elements from a GUI handler in a manner similar to Windows event binding.A variety of custom event methods are provided via the event_handlers table in the GUI code. Most methods accept a single argument, which contains a parameter specifying a function to return, or a collection of parameters which may be used to pass additional information to the callback function.The event_handlers function accepts two arguments, the first representing the parent event handler and the second representing the event handler to which the event should be bound. When an event handler is selected in the GUI, its event_handlers table shows information about the parent and event handlers which this event matches.ExampleThis section contains examples of how to create and display GUI elements in C.O.D.O.M.S. A full description of each example is linked here on GitHub.Creating a Simple Simple PanelThe C.O.D.O.M.S. source code for the following example creates a simple menu panel which displays an image:GUI' This code displays a simple menu panel. Console.WriteLine( " The 'Hello world' example " ); // Create the panel. Panel panel = new Panel(); // Define an action button to be executed when the panel is clicked. // This button fires when the dialog box shown to the user is closed. panel.AddAction< CloseableMenuButtonClicked, Console.WriteLine( " Close to the Menu " ) >() { Console.WriteLine( " Press Ctrl+X to save the file.

LONDON — The head of police in England and Wales was arrested after police said they found a large amount of heroin concealed in a bag of potato chips that the officer took on a recent trip to Hong Kong.The Metropolitan Police said officers had received an anonymous tip and had followed the officer, whose identity has not been released. They found a bag of the snack mix that had "a reasonable degree of heroin in it" when they searched the officer's vehicle.The officer, who has not been named, is being held at a police station pending summons on Tuesday.The drug was seized under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971, and investigators believe they may have smuggled the stash across the border on a flight to Hong Kong before landing in the UK, the Met said.The Metropolitan Police said that the drugs were packaged in a bag filled with potato chips.Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

C.S. Lewis and the Problem of Evil"There seem to be two kinds of stories that Christians tell themselves about God: The first sort is the simple-minded story that everything was designed by God in accordance with the laws of His universe. The second sort consists of stories which claim that there must necessarily be evil, if the existence of God is to be genuine." C.S. Lewis is credited with developing a third sort of story, that of evil as the by-product of human actions. He did so in a discussion of an apparently contradictory statement about God's will to the Romans: a passage in Romans, where Paul states that God "has ordained in the church first to reprove sins and to bring in repentance," and "in the latter end of the age has appointed it as a charge to every man to obey his father and to love his neighbour as himself" (Romans 13:8-10). The trouble is, Lewis does not seem to have noticed that Romans 13:2 is contradicted by the fact that Jesus says on several occasions in the Gospels that God is his Father (Mark 12:40; Matthew 16:18-19). (As an aside, it would be interesting to see, among other things, whether Lewis would have rejected Paul's statement "He has a son in the same way that one man has a hundred sons" in which that same person has one hundred sons on one name—the Lord, as he would have put it.) On the other hand, Lewis does notice something different from other theologians of old who think that we should be glad when God chooses us for His good work, that of salvation: namely, the presence of evil in the world, and this he explains in a remarkable book, The Problem of Pain.The Problem of Evil provides a succinct summary of Lewis's argument about the existence of evil in the world. The problem he explains is that in the very passage he quotes Paul is talking about an evil that is not part of the world. In fact, in this very passage Paul states repeatedly (with no other reference in the NT to any kind of evil) that "the word of God is living and active" (Romans 1:19). And that in addition, the Word of God is "working through His Spirit" (Romans 8:27)."It was by one good God he created this world, and that good God, who is good, has given all its goods—the land in a country, its cities and lands, animals and human beings." There are lots of things in the Bible which don't make any sense. The problem with the concept "good" is that if there were good and evil out there, where could the good come from? The problem with the concept of "life" is that what's important here is the quality of individual existence, not the quantity. But one thing is still clear: if there was a good God, and if he chose us to exist, he would want the good things—the human soul, the good of the individual's life. As the problem of evil shows, he doesn't want it. The problem is that he doesn't give it to us. So if God doesn't give us everything as well as he can make it, then if we want to be his children, then there's nothing wrong with being evil.Lewis argues that because we don't believe in God so there's no evidence for the existence of evil, then there's nothing to blame God for, and we have to try to understand what's going on in his world and figure out how evil came about. The only thing left is to understand the problem he presents, and to be prepared to face it. It's a difficult problem, and it's not easy to solve. In this respect it resembles the problem of the Trinity—and the problem of evil is just as confusing, but far more difficult to solve. The reason being that Lewis and other theologians think that God is all good, but evil does not come about according to the principle "if a tree falls in a forest, and nobody is there to see it, is it not the responsibility of all the people that happened to see to it that nobody gets hurt?" The Bible doesn't say that. It says "if a tree falls in a forest… nobody but those that happen to be sitting there when it goes down!" We can only hope that Jesus himself was ready to face up to the problem of evil (but not too hard, for this was at least 200 years ago!).It's also worth noting that Lewis doesn't really have much use for the idea of "evil" as a by-product of human actions. He never says that "it must necessarily be this way" because the evil of one person is the evil for all persons, and is therefore by the nature of evil inevitable. In order even to make a good statement about God's will to bring about the good in the world, Lewis requires God to have the
"I'm glad to hear that you and your team are still in the process of developing your new website. I too would like to see a site that is accessible to our children and all individuals with disabilities," said the head of the Wisconsin Child Advocate. "The Child Advocate provides guidance on rights and benefits for disabled people and children and families, and their rights when it comes to care and custody of children. We have recently posted new guidelines on how parents should be advised and to what extent they should be advised on the rights and benefits of allowing their children with any disability or disability that may develop."This is a vital issue as most children are in the care of their parents. Your site is now an important part of keeping kids with disabilities, families and their children safe. We hope people will continue to use our resources to help them understand their rights and how to make a decision that will be correct for their family. We encourage you to communicate that information to parents and children so that you can continue to build this important relationship between parents and children, and to keep our communities safer."In her opinion, "The most important part of building strong, protective, and loving relationships with children is establishing open communication between the parent and the child and parents and other important adult family members. In other words, parents should be honest with each other about their parenting decisions; parents, teachers, therapists, clergy, friends, doctors and other family members should always work together to establish the right relationship in the home. Communication should be honest, and it should include the full range of information that a family is most interested in sharing: information about the child's interests, wishes, health, abilities, behavior and appearance, etc. Parents should also communicate well with the child on what the child is currently doing, saying, or thinking about; about their activities, their interests or desires, etc. These interactions will also help the parent make more informed decisions about their decision about their child."(The Child Advocate provides) a forum for parents and adult family members to discuss issues of parenting and children and the role of family members. It can be very helpful during these discussions to listen to the child, and to respond with your own feelings and thoughts. It can also be helpful to use the advice provided by other families. The Child Advocate is open to all qualified family member advocates so they can offer advice, as needed, including if you choose to hire a counselor."The Child Advocate also gives parents information and advice on issues they might face as part of family court hearings, including issues of custody, and the law relating to joint legal and physical custody of a child. They also recommend that families contact family court services such as Child Protective Services (CPS), other child welfare service agencies, and other legal services if they feel they need help in these areas.
ROME—There's a new way to get to the altar: a 3D printer.Italy's Satei Institute for Artificial Intelligence recently developed a system that uses 3D-printed parts to build wedding pavilions. The technology could also be used to build anything from a mobile phone case to a space-age wedding cake.The 3D system, called "3D-Printing Platform" or "3DP," was recently presented at the Institute's annual conference in Rome.Three-dimensional printers are used for a wide variety of things. They can carve, weld, print 3D-printed parts and even 3D-print food.The Satei Institute was founded by the Italian military and scientists specializing in artificial intelligence. It is one of 13 Italian institutes at the forefront of artificial intelligence research.In 2013, the institute partnered with technology company Osterhout Design Group in an effort to develop the 3DP, according to a news release from the institute. Osterhout Design Group is a designer of consumer technology.As part of the partnership, Satei worked with the company to develop an end-user-friendly software package to work with the 3DP. Now it is possible to print wedding pavilions, interior decor, wedding cakes and a number of accessories that the institute has in stock.According to the release, the 3DP can also print architectural features such as windows, doors and floors.The project came after research carried out by Carlo Gaggioli, a 3D printers professor at Satei. At the conference, Gaggioli presented a "technology of 3D printing," which uses layers of plastic to build up structures."At the end of the day, as you are moving down the printing, the plastic needs to be fed in and the plastic needs to be replaced," Gaggioli said, according to the news release. "We found a way to do it in a way that it can be easily operated and is not so costly."A paper from the Satei Institute described the 3DP as a "new design element" and "a new application of the 3D-Printing Technology."The 3DP has been made possible thanks to the work of engineers from Italy's national institute for automation research, or Inria. The 3DP is essentially a 3D scanner that scans the area and creates a 3D model of a specific building, then turns that 3D model into a 3D printable part."This technology is not an alternative to traditional industrial prototyping procedures, which have in fact been used by designers from the architectural firm of M.C. Frere-Jones, a leading architect with offices in London, Paris, Milan and Berlin," the paper reads. "The application of 3D printing is, rather, to provide the designer with a new and powerful means of prototyping."Other examples of 3D printing include 3D-printing parts of car parts to make them stronger.For more, visit the Rome news release.
When a member of the media calls a company to report on an illegal trade, they will have several options for what information to share with them.They can use your phone."What is the most efficient or discreet way to report the issue to an appropriate regulator at the earliest possible stage?" asked the CRTC in its new guidelines for press reporters as they report on illegal activity by Internet service providers.They can use an anonymous chat."What kind of information will you be comfortable sharing with an unknown person?" the CRTC asked. "You should weigh the importance of reporting the report and the privacy implications."They can use an e-mail to report information or they can use the media alert services provided by each company.But when it comes to getting information from the Internet service providers themselves, most media outlets are stuck with the "best option." The only way to get the information is through direct conversations with the service's customer service representatives. When the CRTC released its new guidelines for reporters covering illegal trade, media agencies were directed "to contact each of the [internet service providers] with the information they have on the account."The CRTC does note that the service provider should tell the media outlet which accounts they are aware of, and where they can contact these executives.But media agencies feel it's still too much of a hassle to ask these companies to provide information and to contact them directly is not an option.
DETROIT - A Detroit man with a concealed gun permit has been charged with attempting to commit a crime of force after a 9-year-old girl reported he threw popcorn at her on a flight.Christopher Lee Giannini, 27, was charged with assault with intent to do great bodily harm less than murder Tuesday in Oakland County's 27th Circuit Court.Detroit International Airport Police say Giannini picked up the girl and her family after taking them to the Detroit airport on August 22 of last year.Investigators say they were alerted by the sister of the girl whose brother had been hit by a pop can during a plane ride, causing him to be placed in a medically-induced coma.Investigators contacted the family on September 29, and learned the girl had witnessed the man who threw the popcorn, the family told police."In the investigation, we learned that Christopher Giannini arrived at the airport from Chicago and was asked to meet with members of the Detroit Police Dept. He drove to Detroit International Airport when he noticed an unidentified man standing near the area that the family was seated in the air bus when he was transported.Investigators say the alleged victim's brother was hit by a pop can thrown from the area as the man drove by as he passed through the area on the plane, according to court records. The plane was forced to make an emergency landing, and the injuries occurred to Giannini's brother, officials said.Giannini, who had a concealed carry permit at the time of the alleged incident, is facing charges of assault with intent to do great bodily harm less than murder, assault with intent to do great bodily harm and carrying a concealed weapon.Copyright 2016 by WDIV ClickOnDetroit - All rights reserved.

It is provided for information only, since there is no current source of reliable information.DescriptionThe M20A1, along with the M40A1, is the last model to be manufactured by the Ordnance Department. For the M40A1, the barrel extension was redesigned, giving the weapon new reliability and a larger length of pull, increasing the weapons versatility on the battle field. The M20A1 is also chambered in .30-06, the last service rifle standard in Europe, where it was introduced in 1961.After being designed and tested in 1961, the M20A1 saw very limited use, and was replaced by the next generation M14. Production of the M20A1 halted in 1962 following poor sales, and the final M20A1 rifles were sold to the Australian Army.
Leeds United are to join the race for Nottingham Forest full-back Chris Baird, according to reports in the Daily Mail yesterday.The Championship outfit were forced to use full-back Sam Byram to cover for Baird when the full-back was away on international duty earlier this year.The 23-year-old's future at Forest – the fourth club he has spent time on loan at since moving to the Championship from Bristol City in 2014 – has been the subject of considerable speculation following his performances of late.It should be noted that Newcastle United have been known to keep tabs on the centre-back but have been rebuffed so far, with a reported £10m bid rejected last week.The Mail report that Leeds – who are looking to bolster their squad following promotion to the Premier League – are believed to have turned their attention towards Baird after speaking to Forest's manager Dougie Freedman.Speaking to Sky Sports, Leeds boss Neil Warnock said: "There's lots of clubs involved in it. Everyone is trying."He continued: "There's no way we'll stand here and sign a defender. I can't see too many people doing it. Maybe the club that get Chris have had a chance to go the route of Norwich City (who have recently signed Ryan Bennett from Rangers) and it's been good for them."
In 2012, the city of Seattle, Washington launched a bike-share bike sharing system which has seen steady attendance ever since. It was launched by the City Council; in early 2013 the program was given a name – Citi Bike. And in early 2014, the first members of the program had their bikes returned to them unharmed. Citi Bike made this bold promise.I, like many others, was excited about this bike share system. Many of us had seen other high profile success stories (New York and Chicago have similar systems!) and there seemed to be some exciting momentum in the system.In late-June, Citi Bike did something very remarkable. It had just celebrated it's fifth anniversary and it was about to launch the first ever bike share pilot in the world. This pilot would use a fleet of 15 different bikes (plus a shuttle).Citi Bike was going to give a bunch of us free credit on their bikes. And for those of you who don't know, Citi Bike gives you unlimited credit onto bike share bikes in exchange for a cash fee. At the end of June, the system had about 50,000 members in Seattle and the credit on that first flight was worth $300. And Citi Bikes was going to give a bunch of that credit back to all of them. They called the new program Commuter Club (CC).CC gave our members an amazing chance at free bicycles and at having a greater sense of ownership in the system. It gave everyone a chance (free) to take the Citi Bike on their commute and take more of the bike shares trips into the city. Citi Bike was also going to give a bunch of of members who had been riding bikes around town as part of Citi Bike's initial launch on May 14, 2013, a free credit into the system until September.Of course, Citi Bike is a system. A system is always going to have issues and these issues need to be addressed after launch. Some of the issues the system has had, in the past, have been about a lack of maintenance, about people using the bikes inappropriately, about people not being comfortable sharing bikes with others. And, there are plenty of people who don't agree with free credit to begin with.But all of that is behind Citi Bikes. The system has been a success. In 2012, it launched, and it's now been around for four years – and I say that as an actual resident of Seattle. And the system has always had some people who have complained, and I have met and heard all of those complaints. I have been a member a handful of times, with my last membership in 2013.This has been the primary complaint from people who were members before Citi Bike, although it has always affected more than a fraction of those who were members. There's been complaints about the bikes themselves (it wasn't the same bikes that were out of range or the bikes I was used to). And it is true that the system is now a different place than it was on May 14, 2013. For every issue, there are tons of happy and grateful new members.And what's more, Citi Bike has continued to give members plenty of ways to ride. You can still ride it for free by paying cash for a $40 ticket (for adults, children ages 13-18 and $10 for kids 12 and younger) or you can buy an annual card that gives you unlimited rides or gives you cash back for every ride you take.Last July, the City of Seattle announced a new and much-improved Citi Bike system which has expanded the size of the fleet, increased the amount of bikes in the city, reduced membership fees for everyone and made the system easier to park.That's right. They started charging only $5 more for members so that they can pay for the cars! What better way to give back to the people who helped fund the system than to give them some bikes back!In the long run, I have one message for all of you who are members of Citi Bike: Please sign the petition that Mayor Ed Murray and the City of Seattle sent today. Sign it. Send it to your friends and family members. And please share. Share this.We cannot afford to pay people back. We cannot afford for one thing or another to make the system more expensive (which is often the case). We must always strive to see the system be as fair and equitable and accessible as possible. And that means that when we see an issue – we must find a solution.You can learn more about Citi Bike here.

From Valve Developer CommunityThis article explains how to work with the entity_detail_controller_client_player entity created by the Engine. It is used for the player to specify whether he or she has the ability to aim.IntroductionThe details of whether a player is able to aim are defined in the id.txt file under the "model" header.Example:-weapon: hklm-id: weapon_hklm-player: player2-model: model_hklm-angles: 2-view_angle: 90-aim_dist_angle: 30-uniform: ui/idgameobject/id_gun-model_scale: 1All objects in the game will be loaded into a hierarchy called model which is a subdirectory of the game's source directory. Note: The model tree doesn't exist until the game's start. The player_unit entities from the engine's files exist under the model directory.If the player or server has a model with an id of "model" then the id.txt file has been assigned to this model. On any other instance, this id is not set.When the user enters a map, the entity_detail_controller.cpp handles rendering the model of any player that has the id of the character they are playing. The player (and others in range) should have this model available before the map is loaded.The id.txt fileTo have your model added, set up a basic id.txt file which simply lists the values:-model: model_HklmThe model's name should not be used in the file. For instance, it might be called "model_Hklm.mdl". That does not matter if you use the same model name in other id's in the file.Example:-model: model_HklmHere "model" has been used because the name doesn't matter for purposes of editing in the editor. The file also contains -model, -skin, and -position values to let you set up the model.After doing so, edit the id.txt files under the "models", "-model", "<model name>" and "-model_name" folders.If you have a model named "model.mdl", then you would put id.txt under the "models/" folder:-model: model_HklmThe model_name must match the name of the model you wish to save, and the value of -skin must match the name of the skin you wish to save as.The position value is set in the editor like this:-position: 0The name of the skin must be unique among the skins of each model, and must be at least four characters long and contain alphanumeric characters.The value of -model_name, -skin_name, and -position can be left blank, in which case the models are listed as the same for any of the values.Tip: If you change positions for your model, then move to another map a short time later, the game starts up with the new positions selected for your model. You have to reset the other model position manually first. To do this, go to the "Player->Game->View->Player Status->World->Reverse Map" button and type.Note: This will also work if the player is the server (in which case you can simply set the -view_angle value for the model to zero). See the example below.Tip: If your model has an alpha channel and has an id of "model_Hklm", then use this code: id:model -texture_mask "texture_main_base" -model_name "model_Hklm"This overrides the -skin_name and -position values specified on the model, and creates a new model using that skin.If you want to change the name of your model in relation to what you have selected in the Steam Inventory, then you can put an empty line like this in the file. This will then show up in the models list at the time the map is loaded.-model_name: model_HklmTip: If you are using a skin file you have already saved on your other clients, it might be a good idea to move your skins into this folder so that they can be found when you open the "models/" folder one more time.The parameters for the modelThe parameters for the model are defined in the map's header file.The parameters for the model are given within parentheses in square brackets.+model: 0The initial values are as follows

"They want to put them on the shelf."When it rains $300 Million Dollarsby Brian DunningFiled under Alternative Medicine, HealthSkeptoid Podcast #433September 20, 2010Podcast transcript | Download | SubscribeAlso available in RussianListen:http://skeptoid.com/audio/skeptoid-4033.mp3As the Internet continues to grow at a remarkable pace, so does the "Internet of Everything." It's a concept so absurd that it almost deserves to stay as the most out of touch concept in the world.It's a concept whose full realization will seem like a fantasy.Consider that the Internet of Everything, of which we have already seen prototypes, has more computing power than the Earth has resources of, for example, air, water, forests, etc; more than half of the world's population, about 1.6 billion people, have Internet access through mobile phones; and the number of wireless users on cell phones is expected to increase to as many as 2 billion by 2013. By comparison, NASA's global satellite fleet is around 30 spacecraft and is constantly replenishing itself.By 2013 even the International Space Station will have some kind of Internet connection, but you won't see it on your satellite-equipped phone unless it happens to be orbiting over your apartment or office building at that moment.So just how much data can be collected? That's a pretty good question, since there's a lot you can put on your cell phone without anyone even knowing it.The average cell phone contains about 1 trillion bytes of data, which is about 50 million gigabytes. As a result of this fact, your cell phone is a very effective and ubiquitous way of recording everything you do on it, since you often end up putting the same things over and over.A typical computer has at least 100 times as much memory as your cell phone, and it can record about 1 quintillion bytes of data per second. Now it might seem that the two computers can be combined. In reality, if they were added together, they would only reach a maximum capacity of about 10 quibbles (1 in 10 trillion billion or 2.3 x 1032), so what you are essentially doing is storing a 10 quadrillion byte, or 10 million megabyte, file, rather than a data file.So what are computer programs and data files in the first place? They're just a way of storing information in a way that's efficient for computers to read, and are a huge part of the Internet we now have and will use.We have computer programs that tell a computer how to do something, such as "type this paragraph" in the text box, or write a text message. These programs are called software; they typically have names such as "calc," "word," "gawk" or "python," though it's probably easier if you just think about them as computer programs. They are software written by programmers in various languages. Often, however, the programs that contain the software are distributed as free-software programs, free-software being a loose term for the whole of the software world that includes the source code; and even more commonly, they are distributed under licenses that prohibit you from reproducing the software; thus, it is possible for someone to distribute a program that is free-software (such as the programs you find in the GNU Project's distribution tree) and to give you copies of software written in any of an enormous number of other languages.Most of the programs are written in an ordinary text-editor or word processor language, and most are written for Unix-type operating systems. The Unix system is the most popular computer operating system in the world, with about a billion and a half users running it right now. It's based on the BSD operating system, which was written by a group of UNIX computer science students, and a group of UNIX programmers, working on their own time for many years, working with a few universities, such as MIT, Bell Labs, Carnegie Mellon, etc., to create a complete, robust, and powerful operating system, complete with a graphical user interface. It's also been ported to many other systems, such as MS-DOS.The main difference between Unix computers and MS-Windows computers is that the former allow programs to be written in assembly language (a language for making computer code), while the latter do not. Unix programs are often called "binaries," while MS-Windows programs are "dlls," or "shared objects." Some MS-Windows programs are also called DLLs. But that's a whole different article, and one I don't want to get into here. The Unix-like software is usually installed on your computer and you use it directly. So, Unix-like software is usually installed as a Windows executable or a C program, since it's normally
A group of students at University of California Los Angeles was given a chance to write an opinion piece about the merits of Obamacare, with the help of some of the nation's most notable left-leaning public intellectuals.The class, titled "The Importance of Health Insurance in a Modern Society," was offered through the school's student-run newspaper The Daily Bruin. The opinion piece was authored by UC-Los Angeles graduate student Lina Medina, who called out the U.S. for spending billions on unnecessary health care while simultaneously defunding social programs.The UC-Los Angeles opinion writer went on to criticize Medicare: "the only public insurance program where senior citizens actually feel safe and secure.""Medicine is often more expensive, but people still demand it because they've been convinced it's saving money," she wrote. "But don't you know that in reality it's just increasing costs?"Students also voiced their dissatisfaction with healthcare. The Daily Bruin reported that a large number said they don't have insurance coverage, and that people who do have coverage are still unable to obtain doctors they need to treat their illnesses.This prompted the Daily Bruin:"In the last four years, the cost of health insurance has skyrocketed for our college system's most vulnerable students. The cost of living – the inflation index – is even higher. Many students still don't have health insurance, while others live with cost-increasing bills or worry about the cost of care as they face graduation and beginning their careers. They're not the only ones at risk."A study conducted by the Institute of Medicine found that Medicaid expansion would ultimately save the federal government $32.5 billion over ten years.The Daily Bruin also reported:At UC-Los Angeles, almost 70,000 students receive free or reduced price food assistance which is funded through their financial aid packages, with some going as far as asking to be able to buy breakfast at McDonald's.The Bruin also noted that the school's faculty "are among the highest paid, working on average $80,000 with full benefits after working 50 hours a week – paid vacation and health, four days off a week, and $11.75 an hour."UC-Los Angeles students were represented on an advisory panel for the Affordable Care Act which was sent to Washington, D.C., to meet with members of Congress from both parties during the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.The Bruin is no stranger to left-leaning opinion pieces. This past January, it featured an opinion piece "The American Way of Life." In that piece, the school said its students wanted to show their support for the Affordable Care Act and suggested that "there is no such thing as a free lunch."
There's a big difference between playing music, singing, and talking in public. That's what an "Easter egg" is. It's not supposed to be found in an ordinary game, but rather is something that a developer puts you to think about if you play with friends. (And, let's face it, you're going to play by yourself at least ten times when you're done with Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker.) While many of Sony's PlayStation Vita games put in easter eggs that you need to solve to progress forward, Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker's big Easter egg is what makes the game special.In "Trench," two new characters, Meryl Gray and Roy Campbell, appear. To unlock this cutscene, you need to finish Meryl's story, complete "Revelation" and complete "Trench" before the credits roll, so you're going to have to get through this in one sitting.The whole easter egg is fairly simple. The two characters just walk in the scene and it shows off several things: Meryl is wearing a uniform at the mission briefing, it's a night out, the characters are in their respective uniforms, and Meryl's helmet is on. The other characters are dressed in their regular clothes, the camera pans to the ground, and there's a brief flash of the scene they're in.What makes the easter egg really awesome is that there are no actual puzzles or anything like that. The scene goes off without a hitch as all there is to do is wait for it to unfold. It's a great example of how a simple scene can surprise players and create an unforgettable experience.[via Kotaku and Reddit]
LONDON (Reuters) - The British government will soon publish a draft bill that would require internet service providers (ISPs) to allow the police to view their customers' browsing history, under plans by Prime Minister David Cameron to make law-breaking by internet users more difficult.The British Prime Minister David Cameron arrives with Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace in London, Britain, July 12, 2015. REUTERS/Luke MacintoshCameron set out plans in the 2014 election campaign to make internet-related activity illegal with civil penalties and fines of up to 10,000 pounds ($A16,000).The draft bill, scheduled to be published in July, would set up an oversight "exception" to current rules on the interception of communications as well as internet-related activity, a government spokesman said.While the draft bill will not make a complete ban on monitoring internet-usage data of internet users, it will require internet providers to store it for up to a year in case requests for information are made by law enforcement agencies.It would also require internet providers to store metadata such as a user's web-browser and internet address."We need to act now before the internet is seen as a safe haven for criminals and terrorists, and we hope to reach agreement in the House before the summer break," the spokesman said."We must do all we can to combat the use of the internet for criminal activity and threats to national security and we will continue to work closely with industry."Cameron announced his plans in January 2013, saying Britain should lead the way in the fight against online extremism due to a threat from jihadist groups such as the Islamic State, which have used social media as their tools of propaganda.Cameron made the proposal just weeks after Islamic State made its first large-scale in-roads into British territory, seizing swathes of northern Iraq and Syria.The draft bill has been heavily edited by lawmakers since it was first published in June.
As this series was going to be the first in which we'll review two different types of asexuals, it seemed fitting to compare them against asexual women. In previous episodes of this series, we've noted how some asexuals are men, while others are women. Today, however, we'll find out more about who the asexual community is in comparison to its closest relative.As far as I know, some asexual men are not sexually attracted to women. As far as I know, some asexual men may consider themselves "feminine," while their asexual female counterparts may consider themselves "masculine", or "gender-neutral"… or something else entirely. But what does being "non-sexual" actually mean? How does one define sexuality?In the article below, written by a woman interested in the asexual community, we read,"I feel like sexual attraction to either genders/sexualities is a non-issue for me. I don't really see myself fitting into categories as long as they don't affect my mental health. Sex between individuals of the opposite gender and non-sexuals/lesbians are also an issue in my eyes, and should be seen as such."The article goes on to describe the differences between asexuality and some other non-sexual orientations, but again, we don't feel that it's necessary here to go over each individual point:"I do not consider myself cisgender (passing in any form), non-binary, or asexual. I am neither heterosexual nor homosexual, but neither male-dominated nor female-dominated. I also do not identify as transgender for the same reason that many asexuals do not think it necessary to categorise themselves in sex-classifications for fear of triggering a mental health issue. The term "asexual" is used when people say they are not attracted to either gender/sexuality in any sense, because it is a term that refers to one form of non-sexual sexual attraction."In the article, she goes on to describe herself as "an asexual man whose sexual identity is not tied to the sex, gender, or gender role assigned to him at the moment of birth." For many asexual women, identifying as asexual does not necessarily mean a lack of interest in sex and romance. As stated in the article, "I've identified as asexual for a very long time. I have not always been attracted to people of any gender(s): I did not experience any romantic attraction until I was 25. Before that my entire orientation was non-sexual."As you read the following, we want you to keep in mind that asexuality does not mean that an individual is celibate. Asexuality does not mean a lack of desire to have sex, love, or find true love, even within committed relationships. Asexual individuals do not necessarily consider themselves as asexual (i.e., "non-sexual") from a religious sense, nor are asexuality and celibacy mutually exclusive.In other words, if asexuality was an umbrella term in the context of asexuality, someone that only experienced sexual attraction to certain individuals, then some asexual individuals would be considered celibate (for example, they may choose to live without romance or sex due to religious reasons), whereas, an individual that only experiences romantic attraction can still be considered asexual (for example, they could say they are "non-sexual," and consider it a separate sexual orientation).In our community, there are people who identify as both asexual and celibate. It is our tradition to view a life of celibacy or life of celibacy and asexuality as one and the same. Asexuality should never be seen as synonymous with celibacy, and those who identify as asexual or celibate with asexuality, or those who have a sexual orientation at odds with asexuality, should be treated as such.This is a topic of great interest to us, as asexuality is rarely studied in depth or treated at a professional level of discourse. This means that we have to make decisions as individuals, and those decisions (as we know and as any other individual should) should be rooted in the asexuality community that we are part of. We know that many individual asexuals are not ready to explore the concept of celibacy yet, either because they feel it is a "risk" or they're not able to commit for the time being. We've seen a number of people come to the Asexual Awareness Movement and learn about asexuality before making an emotional or financial commitment to celibacy, and for good reason! Asexuality can be a life long, complex journey!It goes without saying that we believe in the right to choose one's path, and that people can and should choose their own paths (including celibacy) without pressure

And once Li Tingxian arrived there, he immediately summoned an attendant to let him meet up with Ye Shuiyao."This lady wishes to have a discussion on the matter!" Tang Wu Lin asked, standing beside him."Alright." Ye Shuiyao took out from the bottom of her bag a book, "Let's leave it here till after the lecture finishes, then hand it over to this gentleman.""This lady will see." Tang Wu Lin nodded, then began to take out his own book.As he walked into his living quarters, he was greeted by Ye Shuiyao."Young lady, you have made a great choice by choosing me as your Master. If it wasn't for your Master, you may have failed at cultivation." Tang Wu Lin sat next to Ye Shuiyao, "I feel that it's best that we have a discussion on this matter, and to discuss it with others as well.""Yes… Master." Ye Shuiyao looked up at the moon, feeling relieved."Young master, why don't we speak in secret? You're not afraid that you'll be discovered? Otherwise, it'd be better if you didn't tell others about my cultivation." Tang Wu Lin nodded, feeling very comfortable lying to her."Yes… I feel that it's best that I don't lie to others." Ye Shuiyao answered.The entire time, they stayed on Ye Shuiyao's floor, discussing the matter of the Deathly Wish.Tang Wu Lin was slightly anxious and reluctant as he waited, but at the same time, his heart was full of anticipation. Ye Shuiyao was a person who had cultivated for fifty years without breaking a sweat, who had a calm and steady temperament, and as for her appearance, her skin was clear and fair.When he finally felt that her mood was turning more favorable, Tang Wu Lin suddenly sensed a powerful force pushing towards him forcefully."What's that?" Ye Shuiyao was startled, "Tang Wu Lin, this child can be considered to have reached the early stage of Soul Formation, but why is it that you're able to resist my push?""This is my Soul Heart Technique." Tang Wu Lin did not reply her, "As long as I do not let you down, it is equivalent to my training in the Soul Heart Technique."Ye Shuiyao remained silent for a while, before saying, "I've heard before that your training can only be carried out in closed doors."Tang Wu Lin nodded, "You're right, with a closed door, you cannot fully use it. But I've discovered a little technique which is not sealed like the Soul Heart Technique—you can call it Soul Heart Opening.""Soul Heart Opening?" Ye Shuiyao was shocked, "Your Soul Heart Technique is not sealed, but you can still do it?"Tang Wu Lin looked at her and said, "Do you still remember that little boy you once had? I think so."As he said that, he slowly opened his own Soul Heart Technique, the Qi rushing towards her like a huge tidal wave.Ye Shuiyao felt as though her body was about to be split in two. At the same time, she felt a powerful power entering her body. However…"This power is not that kind of power. It's a true kind of power." Tang Wu Lin explained.Ye Shuiyao stared blankly for a bit before shaking her head and saying, "That… that's impossible…""He must have forgotten to seal this power. Perhaps, it's because he didn't seal it well, and as a result, this kind of power is still leaking out… Ah." Tang Wu Lin didn't answer Ye Shuiyao. He continued to keep looking at her with a determined face.At this moment, Ye Shuiyao had already turned pale white. That black magic which she had never seen before could clearly make out the power that was leaking out from her body.Tang Wu Lin continued to stare at her a bit longer before turning and leaving. Once he left, Ye Shuiyao could feel a terrifying pressure emanating from his soul.Once they left the room, she could feel the black power slowly circulating in her body. However, it was not strong, and was only causing some minor discomfort. She could
DUBAI, May 19 (Reuters) - The leader of Yemen's al Qaeda branch said in an audio recording released online it would be impossible for it to return soon after a Saudi-led military operation there that has killed hundreds of its members.Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and other militant groups have taken advantage of a war between Iran-allied Houthi rebels and forces loyal to Yemen's president to seize land since 2015, forcing President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi to flee the capital Sanaa to Saudi Arabia."The Yemeni people rejected the idea of any foreign intervention and rejected all other proposals by the Saudi warplanes over the past few months," AQAP cleric Abu Abdulrahman al Marri said. "But there was no solution on the ground."With warplanes of the Saudi-led coalition launching almost daily air strikes on Houthi-held areas in the south, a senior official of Hadi's government said on Sunday that Yemen's war could go on for years.

(Reuters) - Three former executives at U.S. investment firm BlackRock Inc, including former C.E.O. Howard Morgan, pleaded guilty to securities fraud on Monday and agreed to forfeit $8.8 billion to settle investigations into BlackRock's involvement in the subprime-mortgage-backed securities market.Federal authorities said BlackRock, whose $3.9 trillion assets under management make it the largest provider of mutual fund assets in the world, knowingly facilitated the market-making schemes in which investors lost money.BlackRock Chief Executive Larry Fink was arrested last January, and the other executives were charged a week after his arrest on May 25.Morgan had been held in a Miami jail since his arrest. He was charged with conspiracy and fraud for his part in the scheme, which targeted subprime mortgage bonds and involved a BlackRock-owned asset manager in the Cayman Islands.Morgan, a former chief executive at investment firm Salomon Smith Barney, resigned on Feb 8.U.S. federal prosecutors said that BlackRock failed to exercise sufficient supervision of the two defendants who ran its BlackRock Asset Management unit.Prosecutors said Morgan participated directly in the firm's actions and approved the actions of his managers."It is a testament to the skill and judgment of the men who managed these funds and who were entrusted with their trust and responsibility that we believe the appropriate sentence is appropriate to reflect their misconduct, the seriousness of their misconduct and their impact on our nation's financial markets," said Stephen Mance, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, in a statement.Fink stepped down in May 2010 after BlackRock's internal review of the mortgage-backed securities portfolio found that some of the investments had been sold by dealers it deemed to be sound.But Fink and two of BlackRock's former top executives, Richard Meiss and William Boyett, remained as members of the company's board until last month's announcement of charges.The criminal settlement includes fines of $200 million.BlackRock is still trying to sort through a civil lawsuit. Lawyers for the defendants had said in court filings last week that the settlement amounted to "incompetent supervision and supervision of the firm's own directors" and amounted to "intentional misconduct."Briefing papers filed in court last week showed BlackRock was trying to negotiate a settlement, and that a trial may be held later this year. A federal judge said the firm could begin serving the fines on Monday morning.BlackRock will take the money from its $17 billion fund, which was set up in 2009 to help its wealthy investors, and distribute it to shareholders and others.
There's so much more to the film that goes unmentioned, even though it's a very specific and personal story. For example, in the book, this incident is actually a big secret because it's a big event in the film, though in the book it's something that isn't kept quiet.Another example is that, in the book, Jules is a very good friend; Jules is a father figure in the film but not in the book. A big event that's actually in the book, which gets Jules on his side, doesn't exist in the film.Also, the book has other characters who are important to that story as well. In the movie, there isn't as much screen time given to these other characters like in the book.The one question that I want to ask is, if this story is so important to Jules, why doesn't the plot do more in service of telling this story?
I had the opportunity to talk to one very excited participant, Mr. Denny, in the first meeting I had with the first-floor meeting room on the third floor of the New York Stock Exchange. (It is the second floor at the moment. I have not been inside the first floor yet.)Mr. Denny is interested in learning more about how to create a profitable business that will support his family. But he is also very interested in the possibility of being in a leadership position in a local or national startup business. This conversation took place after a meeting with a well-established local startup in Manhattan's financial district.What's the next logical step that you can take? What are the key takeaways that you can share with others that are interested in going down this road? What are the challenges you've run into?One of his main concerns was how difficult it would be to grow a startup in NYC's venture capital market. He mentioned that he's had trouble finding funding for his business. I explained the situation and I discussed the opportunities that exist in NYC to find funding. I also mentioned that there are very few people that have the connections and the ability to fund this type of venture in NYC without being involved in a venture. It is usually a combination of business development expertise, connections on Wall Street, and an established business in NYC.After a few minutes of this conversation, Mr. Denny and I decided to give up our meetings for the day and set up a time to meet to talk more about the potential of this type of business. I also had another one of my investors in the room with us and an early employee working for us who spoke to his experience from looking into it as an employer.This led us to meet with a couple of other people (not my investors) and go through the potential of the concept of the startup and what the opportunity could be for the entrepreneur.I spoke with everyone that I could reach on the subject and it was clear we all had great enthusiasm about the idea.You've described yourself as very passionate about working in a startup environment, what is it that attracts you to the idea of starting an entrepreneurically-oriented business?I like to see change happen. I don't want to be in charge, I just want to be a part of the team. I've always felt like I want to bring other people along with me, whether by offering my expertise to help with the business of their startup, and then leading them into their next business or helping someone create that role for themselves.What was a key takeaway for you?The key takeaway for me was how important the entrepreneur is to the success of the business. You can't be focused on the product, you need to be focused on the entrepreneur. It's going to help get results faster if you understand who your clientele is going to be because they've got a lot riding on this success. If they're having to make this investment because they have a business to run, they'll be more inclined to invest.The way I look at entrepreneurism and entrepreneurship in general is that these people are the engines that are going to keep you going after you're done with the business. They are the people that will keep the business going without your help. This wasn't an afterthought for me. In fact, it was a key factor.Have you seen other startups that fit this mold?I think other types of businesses are being developed in NYC and across the country. A lot of what makes it possible to get a business off the ground is that the entrepreneur will invest early. They are the ones that will be in the trenches right away, and they will know what to do to be successful.A lot of them have a business background. A lot of them will have had some experience in the private sector, and they'll share those skills with their investors and partners. This is a great group of people to know because it's a group that I know of that will be dedicated to bringing the business to life.Why have you had an opportunity to experience this kind of project in the past?It's always rewarding, every time you get an opportunity to participate in that. I feel like the industry has been on a bit of a downswing since 2008. I think this is great because I feel like we are coming back.It's been amazing to see a new crop of young professionals emerging who are starting to realize that there is a different business opportunity that you could be in if you understand how an entrepreneur works and what their challenges are in creating a successful business.Mr. Denny went out on a limb, spent the resources necessary as mentioned above, and created a business for himself that was a success. He has invested money in other startups and hopes to return the favor to them by investing in the next startup that succeeds.
(CNN) — "She looked like a zombie!" an airport worker told the authorities.She looked like a zombie!The moment that the unidentified woman was taken to an Albuquerque hospital was caught on surveillance video, and has gone viral.The unidentified woman was found in a car, covered in blood and holding a knife to her neck, authorities said.But she was actually trying to get help from a passenger in the back — who did not believe she was a terrorist, the airport worker told the authorities.The unnamed woman had reportedly been suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, the hospital said. Her throat was too swollen to open her right hand, she wasn't breathing and she was having trouble breathing, hospital spokesperson Dan Clark said.She couldn't see, so the authorities asked the passenger to help guide her through the airport checkpoint.
When I go, I want to have a cup of tea with friends and family. I'm not too keen on a cup of coffee either. And what makes a cup of "Tea" different - in a similar way to coffee - is that the difference between tea and coffee starts to fade as you get older, if it's not already done so. Most of us know at some point that our cups are filled with an aroma of something, some kind of fragrance or flavour. It's important to discover when and where the tea begins to take this shape, and I'm starting to enjoy the journey.I'm not talking about some kind of black tea, where you get a "pinch" of the leaves and the smell immediately permeates the room. Instead, you have to go to some of the finest, most well-appointed places in town and have the tea that has been carefully selected.On a recent trip to Edinburgh, I visited the Leaping Bunny tea room, located in the basement of a 19th Century mansion. When I first visited this delightful little room, I didn't think anything of the tea. It smelled fresh and it was delicious. The only change was that I noticed that it was full of white tea leaves.I can't think of anything better to be drinking white tea. I'd never tried it and it was something that had never been on my radar. And suddenly I couldn't get it out of my mouth. It tasted exactly as I remembered it but with the distinct taste of white. I'm a fan!This tea was picked by David Tait, Head Brewer at Leaping Bunny who was also my very first tea mentor. David and his team have been carefully selecting a selection of the country's finest whites in order to get a balanced flavour. It tastes like a nice sweet tea, not a bitter one. When I visited to sample a cup of this tea, I found that it reminded me of an Earl Grey, with some hints of tea and grassiness that made it different and yet oddly refreshing, at the same time. It's not a bad tea, just different.If you're lucky, you'll find a tea like this in your favourite tea shop. Maybe it's in the trolley, or in the glass display tray next to the water heater or the tea pot. They may not show it on the menu, but they're there!
Image copyright SPLIf you use up all the sperm in your lifetime, you could still become pregnant. But the chances are tiny and, in most cases, if you become pregnant, you'll have twins.You might think your semen has been wasted, but it might in fact still be "good enough" for a couple who want to have a family - or even for more.Sperm counts are falling around the world, and the fertility industry is working hard to persuade couples to get a little more "good" in their lives by having more than one baby.In fact, many sperm may survive their short lives, but are often destroyed by the immune system and the immune system of their babies.Image copyright SPLEven if all those sperm get to a woman, they're unlikely to become a pregnancy because of how they are harvested and processed by the body.Sperm is produced by the male testicles when he is fully erect. In a tiny number of cases, he can produce so much he can pass sperm around for a very long time in his urine or faeces.Sperm is "scooped" out of the scrotum, or testicles. When the testicles are inflamed or swollen, the body can not remove the male reproductive organ (sperm ducts) and there is a large concentration of fluid and sperm on the surface of the affected tissues.These tests tend to be performed on men between the ages of 30 and 49.In a paper published in February, researchers looked at 669 cases of men with cancer with testicular disease in the US and Belgium.The men underwent an in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) procedure to remove the sperm ducts. They were then treated with chemotherapy within one month of the IVF procedure.The results showed no difference in pregnancy rates between couples that had a couple of births, and couples that had one or more children. The difference was very small.In the UK, a study by Cancer Research UK and the Scottish Cancer Intelligence Network in 2012 looked at about 2,700 sperm donors with testicular cancer. Two years later, just over 50% of sperm donated to have been inseminated with sperm recovered from one man, and one other.And now, a study presented at the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology in Vienna, in 2013, shows sperm from a dozen donated UK men with testicular cancer have been tested for the presence of a rare chromosome abnormality.As reported in the journal, Human Reproduction, they were found to have the DMRT1 mutation, which causes the testis to shrink.Image copyright SPLIt occurs in around 0.4% to 1% of men in the UK.Experts say that having a child with a single child is a great option for some people, who have a high degree of certainty they will have only one child.But more and more couples want and are now using in vitro fertilisation (IVF) for one baby to have multiple children. IVF can be an effective way of having multiple children regardless of the size of a couple's family - and because of the limited likelihood of the sperm cell being destroyed from the immune system.A study published in January found a test of 1,000 sperm from 20 people with genetic disorders found that around 20% of them could potentially produce healthy offspring.Researchers hope IVF will increase the number of healthy babies in the future.But for those with a genetic condition that can affect fertility (such as an extremely small testis in the case of Down's Syndrome, or very low sperm count), they will need to wait longer for that family member to reach the "childbearing age".Source: NHS ChoicesFollow James on Twitter.
On Thursday, the day after the United States and France launched an attack on ISIS targets in Syria, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov offered his personal opinion of the incident.During a discussion on Russia's TV channel Rossia, the reporter asked Ryabkov: "You've praised the way the French and Americans have conducted their attack, and now there is an anti-ISIS coalition among other countries. Are the operations in Syria, launched without the authorization of the Syrian Government, legal?" Ryabkov said: "Of course, it was legal. As a matter of fact, the operations by the United States and France weren't authorized and are illegal."According to the Syrian National Coalition's media office, the air strike on a Syrian military position came under US command and Russian's in good faith. However, the coalition's spokeswoman Nasser Haddad criticized Ryabkov's remarks. "It's not up to Russia, Russia is not in charge and no one is above law, so I think it's inappropriate for him to criticize the international coalition," Haddad said.RT asked Russian Ambassador to Syria Alexander Lavrentyev: "The Americans had a very serious decision to carry out such an operation inside Syria and there were no UN authorization. Is this not just a little bit hypocritical?""They are saying this is an American operation, yes, as you see, but in fact they do not have any legal basis for it," Lavrentyev replied.
If you're looking for the best of the best in all of sports, you've probably come across the phrase "best of the best".This quote is attributed to John Wooden, who once said "If you have to pick four things, pick 4: Best team, best player, best coach, best coach" to describe the characteristics that a great team should possess.What it means to be a best team is difficult to determine. The best team of the best is likely different every year. In general, it just means that your team did better than the best team of the best.Some people might argue that winning is a measure of team quality, and the best team of the best might as well be the team that just won the most games. After all, teams that win the most games tend to do the best in the long term.If you want to talk about the current day best teams, I might be happy to oblige, but before I bring up the new crop of best teams, let's look at some of the best teams from before the era of Best of the Best.The Best of the Best TeamsThese teams actually play the game the best, and there are quite a few of them over the last 80 years.The Chicago Bulls had one of the greatest runs in team history. They won 5 NBA championships in 7 years. They won championships in 1968, 1973, 1974, 1975, and 1976 and had an incredible 30-1 regular season record over that time. The next best team to Chicago in regular season record was the Boston Celtics.The New York Knicks were one of the top teams of the last two decades. They won 5 NBA championships in the 1980s.The Miami Heat won 2 of the last 3 NBA championship. They were the best team every year from 2000 to 2003, and won 3 NBA titles in the 2000s.The Los Angeles Lakers have been the gold standard of the NBA for the last 50+ years. They won two of the last three NBA championships in the early 2000's.The Detroit Pistons won 4 NBA championships from 1967-1973.The Washington Bullets won 6 NBA championships from 1966-1973.After that, I'll break down the best teams from the last 25 years using some of the names I mentioned above.A Quick History LessonIn case you've never heard of the word "Best" before, I'll try to briefly sum up their impact on the basketball world.The best of the best are a way to measure the best of a group of people, teams, or athletes in sport. They're not a way to quantify their accomplishments, but rather use that to understand and communicate a certain skill.This is one of the purposes of the phrase as it was coined by John Wooden, in reference to team wins.The phrase is frequently quoted on Twitter, and it's common for people to reference or cite it when answering basketball trivia questions. For example: "What number did the greatest basketball player of all time, George Gervin, wear?" Or "Who was the 1st to ever dunk the basketball?"
MELBOURNE (Reuters) - The number of Australians who have lost personal information via online services such as Google in the last fortnight has climbed to a new high, a leading cyber security company said on Friday.The logo of Google is seen in front of a logo at the company's office in Rome, Italy, April 13, 2016. REUTERS/Alessandro BianchiThe Australian Cybercrime Online Reporting System, also known as ACORN, saw an increase of 1,000 new cases in the last two weeks, according to Australian Cyber Investigations Centre (ACIC) chief executive David WalshACIC released its findings in response to a request made to it by Greens senator Scott Ludlam. The data came from a report which found that as many as 4,600 of the 11 million complaints from 2011 to 2015 had been lost to the internet."These are people's lives that have been exposed," Walsh told reporters in Melbourne."What it tells us is that ACORN does have a real-time picture of which personal information is being left in the internet. That can be very useful for people who are going to make a complaint."He said it had become apparent that the personal information of hundreds if not thousands of voters was likely to have been compromised by online service providers, and was likely to have exposed politicians' personal information to fraudsters.ACIC released data from the ACORN site showing the number of privacy and security incident reports over the past fortnight.ACIC said that after dropping to nearly 200 in September last year and November last year, the latest month to report data, there had been about 950 reported incidents in the last fortnight.The highest number, 765, was recorded in the last two weeks between Monday and Thursday last week.ACIC noted that other countries such as the United States and Britain had been using similar databases for years, but said that Australia had had trouble using ACORN to find data breaches.The new report comes months after the High Court ruled that the data of Australians whose email was stolen by criminals overseas could be made public, although it left the question of how it was stored.ACIC said the data was likely to have gone to criminals in the United States. It said about a third of the incidents took three months to resolve and about a half took a year to be fully resolved.
We're going to be talking a lot about this, so hang with me:We're going to be talking a lot of this, a lot. The season 2 finale of "Game of Thrones" is here, and we're still not done with the season (or the whole season). (This is not a spoiler alert; "Game of Thrones" is just one part of my binge series.) What I won't do is make predictions about the rest of the season, because I might lose sleep over it. I will, though, give you a few predictions about what we are in store for in season 3. Here are some things we know for sure about season 3.We're not going to see a full Targaryen invasion in season 3, and you can thank Tyrion for that. We don't know what kind of invasion he's planning, but we do know what kind of show he'll be writing about it—and it's probably not quite as good as "Game of Thrones." In fact, it's quite possible that what we're in store for is not the best of "Game of Thrones" and that our worst fears have been confirmed.You may recall that, during a conversation between Tyrion and Bronn, Bronn asked the most important question of all:Why did you say these things, Bronn?"Tyrion is the world's greatest chess master. But what he has not figured out, is how to play chess in the court of the Mother of Dragons." That is probably about as good a summary as I could have asked on this topic, and you know why? Because we have only known Tyrion Lannister for the past year and a half, so none of us are a chess expert. I say this as someone who, until episode 5, had never watched any "Game of Thrones." So I feel a little weird mentioning a game I've never played. (I might have to tell my mom about this later… or I might make a "Game of Thrones" movie. Who knows?)In the meantime, if you don't watch "Game of Thrones," then go watch it. Because you will love it more than you have ever loved anything else in your life.Tyrion won't be happy about the show, because he knows it is going to be terrible, even less so than his "Game of Thrones." His main objection would be that Tyrion is being offered a dream job—a seat on the small council of Westeros—the moment he gets out of his prison cell. You could write a whole book by comparing Tyrion and Joffrey. Tyrion's desire is for the Iron Throne, which means that he hates all his enemies and dislikes that everyone loves him. That's the most Joffrey-like thing Tyrion could do. In the "Game of Thrones," he was always thinking about himself. This is different.What's the most "Game of Thrones" thing your characters say or do or do not do at all in this episode?Mara's speech was the most disturbing in season 2, but it wasn't until later that we realized what a weird thing she said. It was an echo: she heard the other characters' thoughts and said them back, as if they were talking directly to her.So, instead of getting to watch these characters talk directly to her again, she's been listening to other people talk directly to her.This may not be a big deal for many people—and it's not a huge deal for me, because I don't talk to people back at the bar all the time—but it is a huge deal because it means that Tyrion and Cersei did not make up after this whole scene.Did the Sand Snakes just come back?As I've mentioned before, the Sand Snakes do not have a real plot in "Game of Thrones," and their return was the most anticipated moment of the season finale. They were supposed to show up in the series finale, but for reasons that I do not understand, George R.R. Martin decided he wanted to do something a little more interesting with them, especially since the whole "Sand Snakes" thing might as well be a lie. In other words, he made an entire episode out of them, but they never showed up in a meaningful way. Now they do, and it feels good, especially since we know that it involves Cersei, and not because we can read anything into it. (And, as you can see above, I'm a little bit surprised I didn't guess that something really was going to happen with the Sand Snakes after episode 4.)In this episode, however, we do get to see the Sand Snakes interact with each other. For most of the episode, they are only in the background; sometimes they might speak, like on Bronn's horse, but otherwise, we just see them as extras
The United States is expected to announce on Wednesday a new round of sanctions against North Korea that may be even tougher than the first set of sanctions imposed after the country's third nuclear test in February.The sanctions are likely to target new individuals and companies in the country, and may apply a heavier financial arms embargo, a senior administration official told Reuters.The sanctions could be announced as early as Wednesday morning, the official added.A North Korean propaganda poster which features Kim Jong Un, leader of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), stands on the bank of the Yalu River, near Sinuiju, North Hamgyong province - Sept. 15, 2015. REUTERS/Damir SagoljThe sanctions will include a ban on coal, iron, lead, lead ore, and seafood exports, as well as new sanctions on North Korea's bank transactions. They are expected to be announced by Treasury Secretary Jack Lew and US Ambassador to the UN Samantha Power. They will likely target a total of around $11 billion in new sanctions, according to Reuters calculations based on the most recent data on the United Nations Database of Conventional Arms.Although North Korea conducted its third nuclear test with the knowledge of the United States, Russia and China, the United States and its allies have shown a much more dramatic increase in economic pressure to try and get the country to change its nuclear and missile program.The new sanctions will most likely be announced just days after North Korea conducted their fourth nuclear test on Sept. 3 - the day after North Korea's Supreme People's Assembly met. Kim, in a televised address, claimed the test was a hydrogen bomb.The sanctions on North Korea's bank transactions will be the first imposed since Kim Jong Eun was elected by the North's people in a landslide victory in 2012, according to North Korean officials.North Korea's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. US officials have not commented on the timing of the sanctions.The sanctions announced so far have targeted the country's nuclear and missile programs. The new restrictions will target people or entities that aid or conduct business with North Korean entities, or the country's exports to or imports of weapons from China or Russia. These bans will apply to all sales, purchases, and dealings across international borders.
Polls from a number of outlets, including the New York Times, CNN, Monmouth University, and Quinnipiac, show Hillary still enjoying strong leads over Donald Trump among voters in the presidential race for the state of New York.As in many other swing states, the former secretary of state leads on a number of different issues, and has a clear advantage on who would provide the best president.In an update of its previous poll out last week, Monmouth reported that Clinton leads Trump by 50% to 39% nationally. That includes a lead of 54% to 37% just from Pennsylvania, a state which the Republican nominee is trying to win back to put him within reach of winning the White House.In a separate survey, the New York Times said that the majority of New York Democrats polled believe Clinton to be their preferred candidate, while the minority of Republicans favor Trump.Among Democrats, Clinton garners 50%, and while Trump fares better at 41%, a majority of Republicans say he should not be the Republican presidential nominee.The Times also said the results of the New York State voters polled suggest that Clinton has an advantage on who would be better for the state's economy. She's currently tied with Trump on this metric at 44%.As a result, voters in New York say that she's the better option for the state and the nation.On the other side of the equation, voters in New York also gave Clinton a 50% to 40% advantage on who would be better for the economy and on who is the better choice for handling terrorism.On the Democratic side, however, support for Clinton on economic issues is higher (54% to 39%).Trump's advantage on who would be better for both domestic and foreign policies, however, is slightly narrower. 49% to 43%, and on terrorism, he leads by nearly half a point (48% to 43%).Trump leads Clinton among men in New York in all categories, and leads by 10 points among those ages 25 and over.In a state like New York where Clinton doesn't have the benefit of incumbency, the former first lady, U.S. senator and Secretary of State clearly has a leg up on her likely rival.But even after four weeks of campaigning, the numbers aren't exactly rosy for Clinton in the state of New York. The last New York poll that could be considered in the same ballpark as the current poll was from NBC earlier this month. That poll showed Trump and Clinton tied, and found a large number of independents undecided.Another poll was conducted in New York by ABC and the Washington Post in late August, during the Democratic National Convention. That poll also had Clinton up by five, with 51% compared to 40% for Trump.Follow Phillip On TwitterHave a Tip?

It was, as a student, a year-long nightmare. And it ended today.The University of Michigan announced Friday morning that it had fired football coach Brady Hoke and demoted Mike Bobinski, the university's director of student development.The University of Michigan has fired football coach Brady Hoke, sources told ESPN on Friday. Bobinski, who took over last year, will lead the team. AP Photo/Carlos Osorio"A decision has been made by the Board of Regents and President Young to terminate the contract with coach Brady Hoke," the announcement read. "Coach Hoke should have better communication with his players, and he needs to put forth a different, improved performance with them both on the field and in the classroom."The university has made this clear to the coach and he has agreed with our decision."Hoke and the University of Michigan Board of Regents had been in ongoing negotiations since Dec. 15 in an attempt to avoid the school's first program-wide dismissal in 16 years."Following consultation with members of the football coaching office, the football team and University, the Board of Regents has agreed to terminate the contract of Coach Brady Hoke," the regents said in the statement. "This was done in the best interests of the college football team, and Coach Hoke."The abrupt announcement was a shock to university faculty, staff and players. The university did not release a statement early Friday afternoon, but sources said Hoke notified the athletic department that he was fired as early as 5 a.m.Many on campus said the abrupt decision made news conferences Thursday and Friday pointless."I didn't see why more couldn't go on Thursday and Friday," Michigan offensive lineman Matt McCants, a sophomore, told ESPN. "Obviously if it was like any other person that was fired, you'd be mad, but to just not talk about who the coach was, that's the main reason I didn't go on any more."McCants and offensive coordinator Doug Nussmeier had previously called for the coach to be fired."We have been pushing for this for two years now ... it's not a great feeling," Nussmeier said Friday. "The reason I'm still here is because of what Coach Hoke has done for me and my brother."Hoke met with University of Michigan officials to discuss his future on Jan. 25. On Tuesday, he told his players to go home for Spring Break because negotiations were going nowhere.Michigan had been searching for a coach after the dismissal of Brady Hoke in October, a firing that came after the former Michigan head coach and athletic director Jim Harbaugh and the school had a tumultuous relationship.On Oct. 18, just a day before Harbaugh officially stepped down as head coach, U-M interim athletic director Jim Hackett met with Michigan's players to outline his expectations for Hoke. They had a long and heated conversation with Hackett and Michigan's president.Harbaugh's firing was seen as a statement in itself and a final end to the Wolverines' tenure as a Big Ten football program. Hoke, a former NFL quarterback, was not the problem.The U-M players' meeting was conducted by Mike Garrett, a former New England Patriots defensive coordinator who is now the head coach at Central Michigan. Hackett said in a news conference days after the firing that players told him, "They felt disrespected and a part of the team had lost itself."Michigan football players kneel out of respect to the U-M Players' Association during the playing of the national anthem before their game against Michigan State at Michigan Stadium Dec. 24, 2016 in Ann Arbor, Mich.U-M players have held a number of meetings on the issue, with the most recent one occurring at a university-run training center in Ann Arbor in late November."When things are going against you, it makes things much harder and it makes it very hard for you to find the solution for everyone involved," defensive end Mike McCray said. "It's the players' time now."The University of Northern Iowa fired coach Kirk Ferentz in December after a five-year stint. Ferentz had a record of 64-44 and had only won one season outside of Michigan, but the school has a new football coach in Iowa State's Matt Campbell."What is most important to me is to make sure that all the programs I support remain strong," Hackett said.On Friday, Michigan Athletics Director Dave Brandon said, "We are very grateful for Coach Hoke and the support he has given to our student-athletes and the staff here at Michigan, and we wish him the best."On Thursday, Hoke told Michigan coaches in a video message that the university needed to be more accountable, and the message was relayed to players. Some players questioned why that message was
Hackers are targeting the computers running the Democratic Party's voter registration database, and there is "a real threat that individuals could use this information to engage in voter fraud," the party said in a statement Monday. "Our security team detected the intrusion, as well as attempts to access other system accounts, but there is no evidence that the account information has provided access to the DNC."The news comes two months after hackers broke into the records of the Republicans' national committee and stole opposition research on Donald Trump.At the end of August, the New York Times reported that Russian hackers had been using malware that exploited vulnerabilities in the DNC system to launch attacks on the Vermont senator's campaign computers, and that the Republican National Committee was aware of the attack.As CBS News reported, Russian intelligence agencies, which hacked the Democrats, were also monitoring Sanders for signs of disloyalty.It's not clear who is behind the attack but it's known that the hackers are known for their skill with computer tools.The New York Times reported that the hackers gained access to the software as well as the computer network of the Vermont senator's campaign, and accessed a "camellia" server, which was identified in security circles as being a Russian tool.They did not get deep enough into the system to gain access to Bernie's personal information, but an analyst with ThreatConnect told CBS News it's "very likely" that "they got a glimpse of his personal information that he had stored on that computer system." That information includes his Social Security number, home address and credit card numbers."When the Sanders campaign discovered the breach, it immediately took steps to update its software so that the server was protected by two-factor authentication," said his campaign manager, Jeff Weaver. "We then alerted the DNC.""When the Sanders campaign discovered the breach, it immediately took steps to update its software so that the server was protected by two-factor authentication."He added in a statement that the Sanders campaign "believes that, at this time, our data was not compromised and will remain secure until the DNC and FBI provide an update."This is a developing story and will be updated as more information becomes available.
"We will take you out of there!"The officer told me to get back into the car, which I did. (He later pointed out the window of the passenger seat at my face and said this wasn't safe for me. The officer then explained that he was "trying to get to the bottom of this issue and I have not seen this woman who could've done the harm that this has done." Then he started to give me directions.)"Why are you calling 911?""I can't talk with you," the officer said. "I'm calling them for you."The driver, the woman in the vehicle, and the two security guards in town (I can only assume they're on her side) had all been in the other van, and were on their way back, too, when I was pulled over."I got here a minute ago," I told the officer, who then started to tell me why I was being pulled over while driving."What did you do here?""I didn't know there are no lights on here. When I drove by, I saw the other vans, like, they were in the middle of the street.""What are you doing in our driveway?" the officer asked."I just came here to get the car fixed, I don't know what's going on."And then she started pointing at the other vans and said:"Are you going to call your friends if you get pulled over?""I am going to call my friends," I replied, "I don't want to get in trouble."He then said: "What are you saying that'll get you in trouble? We're going to take you out of there."So I got back into the van and the other driver took off."What's so wrong with having a front license plate light? Why is that a problem?" I asked the officer as we headed back towards the parking lot. I figured that, if only one of the vans had had a front license plate light, the other two wouldn't have been so close to each other, and the woman wouldn't have seen me until it was too late."There's the problem with that," he told me. "It's illegal. We have to go to the mayor for permission if we want to do this. I can't do this."And so it sat, and waited, and sat. After a little while, I couldn't take it any more, and the driver pulled into a rest area."Are they going to put the citations on the van?" I asked."You'll pay $250," he said. "And they'll take the van. I can't take it with me. I'm not allowed to take an illegal van.""Are you taking me to jail, or just taking me into court?""I'm just taking you to the police station," he said. "We've heard that you're involved with that woman. I'm just going to give your name and you can call me back later."That seemed strange to me. I had just been pulled over for being too slow through a light-controlled intersection, and now here I was on my way to the police station because I was about to find out where I was going to be put when I was pulled over for parking illegally.He was right to call the mayor of the town we'd just visited and ask if he'd like to see a front license plate light in our town, and he was right to let us park, but why stop in the first place to ask if we could get our cars fixed? We'd just left the house anyway, after all.He also started talking about the state's parking ordinance. It's pretty interesting.The officer gave us our tickets, the $250 fine on top of the state's $200, and told us to "go to the police precinct and bring copies of the tickets." He had taken our license plates off, and put them back on the other van, then parked it there for a while to make sure we would pay. This seemed pretty weird, but it was the only option at the time. The officer then took us to the police precinct.After the paperwork had been done and we'd gotten what we expected, an officer came in and said that they were going to turn the van in to the insurance company that was covering the damage. The driver went with her. We were asked to sign a document stating that we would "make no comment" about what happened.We did.We still haven't heard from our insurance company.Advertisements
This has finally happened - it will soon be 3 years since I first got the opportunity to design a motorcycle. I have always loved motorcycles, I have always wanted to do something which I could fully enjoy in my spare time... and I have finally achieved that.For me a Motor Bike is something which provides a lot of different reasons to experience, for me a motorcycle is simply a tool which you can use to accomplish things you cannot in a car.I designed the Yamaha R1 because I didn't feel like working for a company which just produced cars, as I love the thrill of designing my own bike, a bike which is not only good to ride but also has a real potential to be used for the transportation of people. I have always loved designing motorcycles and I hope there is a lot of pleasure for me in the design and manufacture of the R1. All the ideas which were developed to create this very bike have been created to make it possible. I believe it is very important for a company to be interested in what it designs - the people of the world have much to talk about with motorcycles.

The U.S. government is preparing to spend $500 million to fund a consortium to build the second U.S. nuclear power plant in Louisiana -- and possibly up to $4 billion on others in the region, according to documents obtained by The Associated Press.The documents were released to the AP in response to a request made under the Freedom of Information Act.The AP's report follows other recent media reports about a potential nuclear renaissance in the U.S. Southeast. The AP has previously reported about several proposed reactors in Louisiana and Mississippi.According to the documents, the Energy Department is considering funding a project that would put a plant near Magnolia, La., near the Mississippi shoreline. The government would also support other proposals to build plants elsewhere in the Southeast.The project would be named EPCOR or the Energy Production Corporation of the Mid-South, according to two documents prepared for a meeting of the Mid-South Association of Regulatory Boards in Baton Rouge, La. The meeting was recently canceled when the consortium behind it failed to respond to emails from the AP.At least a dozen members representing the regulatory board in Baton Rouge and Louisiana's coastal regulatory board said this week they had no idea how the consortium would pay back its loans or what would happen to Louisiana power rates if the nuclear plant never gets built."It doesn't mean this will happen or this won't happen," said Mike Larkin, an engineer and regulatory board member for the Coastal Basin Management Council. "It was just to keep us busy this year. … We have a few projects like this."Nuclear power is currently the largest source of electricity in Louisiana, but there's not much more than that in the state -- no new nuclear plants, no planned reactors.The Mississippi and Louisiana permitting processes for nuclear plants take more than four years.
You have probably seen photos of the original Einsturzende Neubauten. I am going to tell you about that and what happened after the original factory was destroyed. There was a big protest against the plan to destroy a city center that was the centre of the industrial revolution in Germany. They were not interested in people. They wanted to destroy the city but the people were not interested in destruction.A group of workers in the 1930's tried to stop the building of a new Einsturzende Neubauten plant by erecting barricades. The plant wanted to keep building on the old site. Then they hired some local people who did not want to do it the same way they had been doing. The workers were then hired, paid, and allowed to stay on the new site.The new Einsturzende Neubauten plant built in the city center in the 1920's became very successful because a lot of people from other districts did business there. The people of Einsturzende Neubauten were proud of the city center they built. They wanted everything to be perfect but something was wrong.The original Einsturzende Neubauten plant was destroyed by the company that operated it, the same company that owned Bremen Gas. The new Einsturzende Neubauten plant was being built on what was called a "greenfield" site with the original park and trees. The Einsturzende Neubauten plant was planned to be built on a large scale and was supposed to have the largest building on the site. The original plant was supposed to be a city center.The new Einsturzende Neubauten plant had to build many things from scratch. The workers were given a lot of equipment that was only available to corporate America. The workers were not allowed to have some equipment because the equipment costs a lot of money in Germany today. The workers worked on the plant and were expected to pay a lot. They were expected to do the work in one day. The factories were small and not well organized. They did not have good roads. The plants were small and small people worked in them. The workers had no health care. There were no paid sick days. There was very little work to begin with. They had a small assembly line and no actual "production" or sales. They did not sell products or services. Einsturzende Neubauten simply manufactured machines that they sold to big corporations. They only made the machines, but they only sold the machines. They did the research that had to be done for them to work. There was no money in marketing because the people were paid a small salary for a job they had no interest in. The people of Einsturzende Neubauten were paid a little more and had some health benefits. The workers were not allowed to go home during an eight hour day, which meant that they had to continue working and stay on the job. There was no vacation or sick leave.The Einsturzende Neubauten workers had a lot of anger and frustration. They wanted something different. They did not like big corporations owning everything. They wanted local ownership and control.They were not going to accept a company like Bremen Gas deciding what they could have and can or could not take. They wanted to be part of the community even if some of the things they did were not a good idea.In March of 1934, the Einsturzende Neubauten workers went on strike. They occupied the plant while other workers were out. The Einsturzende Neubauten company took action against the workers and tried to kill them. A lot of them were shot. Einsturzende Neubauten fired everyone on strike, except for a few that were sent home. Many of the workers were killed. Many of the workers who had not been fired went home and tried to organize the workers. They continued getting paid and tried to work. They also went to work. The Einsturzende Neubauten company tried to get rid of everyone on their side. They did not get far. Some of the people who were fired came back to work. Some of the union organizers were fired and killed. After that, other workers tried to stop Bremen Gas. That is where the Einsturzende Neubauten plant was located. Most of the people that went on strike at that plant was from the neighborhood that made up the Einsturzende Neubauten factory area.The Einsturzende Neubauten plant is still standing. It has become a museum called the "Dachau" of the Einsturzende Neubauten company.In this photo, the people who went on strike are marching near the Einsturzende Neubauten factory. The workers
On January 23rd, the government of the People's Republic of China closed the borders to the United States of America in order for the people of that country to "restore their national dignity and dignity". This border closures has affected almost every single corner of the United States, including our southern border.What exactly happened and is it worth your hard earned money? We all know the government and military of China has never been shy about conducting military exercises close to its neighbors and also the Chinese Communist party's own People's Liberation Army (PLA) has been known to take military action from time to time too.While we do not condone these military exercises or any threat or action against neighboring countries, we believe it is the government of China – not us, our allies and friends — that should bear the primary culpability.In the coming weeks and months, we will be updating this page with a more comprehensive look into the closure of U.S. borders to the People's Republic of China.To date, we have already compiled detailed information describing every closed border to the People's Republic of China in the United States and we will keep you updated as new closures and details are released. For now, here is the latest and most up-to-date info you can find:South of the Rio GrandeA border closure of the Rio Grande river between El Paso and Laredo, Texas, was implemented around late December 2015. According to the U.S. Border Control there were only six agents on site, just enough to handle about two hundred illegal immigrants crossing through the river. This is the only border closure of the U.S. in which the entire river is taken out of service as part of the closure. The U.S. is a sovereign nation which can determine the security of the border it owns.MexicoSeveral Mexican border crossings are closed to U.S. Border Patrol agencies around the country. These closings are mostly temporary, and some remain active. In some cases the closure is a consequence of the closure of the U.S. border with Canada. The border closure with Canada has closed the Canadian border to U.S. Border Patrol agents, making the ports of entry unusable. On September 6, 2016, the Canadian government announced that the Canadian Border Services Agency will be working with U.S. and Canadian governments to reopen the Canadian border with the United States. In order to make this happen, the Canadian agency will be using special fencing to construct new security features in the area while working with the U.S. Border Services Agency to develop and implement plans for the restoration of the border. The temporary closure of Mexican borders to U.S. Border Patrol agents does not mean that all border arrests have been eliminated but since September 2014, border arrests of illegal immigrants are down significantly, from 1,200 illegal immigration arrests per day in August 2013 to just 150 per day in August 2016.Evan Vucci/APSouthwest borderBorder restrictions are typically implemented on a week-long basis at many border areas. On January 7, 2016, the Rio Grande Valley sector began implementing a week-long closure of its U.S-Mexico border area for commercial trucking and human smuggling. The reason for the closure is likely to be the surge in recent months, as much of southern Texas is not used for human migration. The closure has reportedly been successful in cutting down human trafficking activity and also allowed the government of Mexico to better patrol the border and catch illegal immigrants making the long journey northward. The closure is still in effect and the U.S. Border Patrol is attempting to catch anyone crossing the border through its enforcement efforts.The border closure is one of a large number of border closures the U.S. government implements every year. The U.S. has nearly 500 mile long land border with Mexico.Naco, Arizona - Southwest BorderOn February 1st, 2016 Arizona became one of just fifteen states to require all state law enforcement agencies to report any suspected illegal activity occurring on state-maintained facilities or grounds within their jurisdictions to the Arizona law enforcement agency first and foremost. According to the Arizona Department of Public Safety, the new law allows law enforcement agents to report illegal activity they witness in Arizona without fear of being detained or ticketed by local or state authorities. This law creates a statewide database to monitor activity, which officials hope will ultimately reduce the influx of illegal immigrants to the U.S.
In a bid to address the nation's health care crisis, President-elect Donald J. Trump announced today the formation of a White House commission tasked with providing him a report on reforming the health care system.Leading the effort will be Republican National Committee Chief of Staff Reince Preibus, who in a press statement described what the commission would do as being "focused on real solutions that will improve people's lives by lowering their health care costs, controlling their health care costs, covering more people more effectively and improving access to high-quality options for Americans."A report on the commission is expected in early 2017, a timetable that does not align with reports that have previously issued from President Obama's administration.The Republican Party's plan would repeal and replace Obamacare, which is now law, while giving states the ability to opt out of some of Obamacare's more burdensome provisions.The details of the plan remain unclear, but a plan that will presumably replace Obamacare will have to meet numerous challenges.According to Politico, one of those "challenges" will be figuring out if and when a proposal will ever become a law.
After the last few meetings we've been able to focus more on working on the actual mechanics of the game. This means it's a little more like a live game which is great but also a little scary. This means we haven't been able to post a lot of progress images yet. We don't want to give too many spoilers ahead of time but we have some information and images that you can expect to see very soon and soon if you follow us on social media.Our artist has made a great start on the character designs. They are looking great. And now it's your turn.What's the current state of the game?Well, there's a full build of the game but you can see the first parts of the "Tower" area. The first dungeon is complete with the first boss. There's one new enemy added to the game this week, and we have plans to add some more in the future.Some of you may have heard that the main goal of the game is to get as many people as possible playing it as soon as possible. We want to get more testers into the game so that we can see what people are like and the issues some of you have when playing the game for the first time. There's a few different ways to help:Help us keep you in the game by sending us feedback and ideas about the game on reddit, twitter or email (info@camelotknightgames.com if you want to help!) We need to know more about how it looks, feels, how long it takes to finish a mission and so on. We're trying to improve that information in the game so that anyone playing the game will get the information they need to be able to make an informed decision about whether or not they want to play their first mission.Donate to us on Kicktraq and give us funds that will go directly into the costs of the game to ensure we can keep developing it. There are some things on the table that will provide some extra incentives if we can fund them through the kickstarter.We can't keep developing Camelot Knight if we're not sharing updates about the game. Please tell your friends about it, give us thumbs up on steam and check us out on all our social media outlets.The game is currently undergoing heavy development so please stay tuned for updates, the next couple of weeks will be busy. Stay tuned to our subreddit for more updates at reddit.com/r/camelotknightThat's all for now,The Camelot Knight Team
What is a "NICU?"I'm really excited to go in there this summer (no, seriously). Last year, I was in the NICU on more than 20 days. I was there longer than I have ever been, both times. The first visit there was a four-week stay, the second a two-week stint. I will have been in the NICU for about 7 months if I am lucky by then (and the hospital won't want to release me, so…).   That makes me pretty awesome in my own way!!I had a very happy childhood, but when I reached my teenage years, I had an overwhelming desire to change, to be different from my mother and stepfather. I was a good and kind girl, but I was a bad liar.   I felt like I didn't exist. I wasn't pretty, or funny, or smart, or pretty cool, but I'm what they call "a good girl," so I should probably just live my own life and have some fun.   My mother's family (she moved many times with my father) was the opposite.   Not only was she not "girly," she was so incredibly gorgeous that I didn't care.   She had a huge personality that could take you to some pretty funny places, but she was also a strong woman. So, what do I do? Well, I guess I just get as far away from there as I can.And what is the NICU?I can see where you're coming from, and I won't sugarcoat it.   It is an amazing place. No one in my family has ever had to go there, but it still remains a part of the family for me — because the nurses are there with patients, and it's a part of life for a nurse. I will never forget my first day there, but I would tell you the same thing right now because you will still remember it, probably.The nurses at the NICU look much different than nurses you hear on TV. They are much older and dressed in their scrubs. They are also really good at what they do.  I was able to watch nurses who had spent their entire career in the NICU at other hospitals on a daily basis, and you'll see the beauty in those nurses when you are there.  It's not like what we see in TV.   When you come into a room from another hospital, everyone looks the same. The nurses wear scrubs, they wear hats.   Your eyes have a hard time taking in all of them at once.   The nurses in the NICU wear short-sleeved shirts, dresses, even skirts and dresses.   When you walk into a room, you would definitely see some variation in the ward, but you never would have seen the nurses' scrubs in those photos.  When it has to perform an emergency, they can't call a nurse over. We have an emergency nurse, but we would have to wait for a second nurse to get there.   The first nurse would stay close to the patient they were treating, and then we would have to wait for another nurse. We also had to ask everyone to come in and watch a screen. I wasn't sure what to do, because it was not my room.I did talk to nurses who were working in a medical device room, and the way they handled things were extremely kind, and they even taught me things about using the machine.They also were very, very good. You hear those stories about the nurses getting hit by cars, and you know what? You will hear those stories about the NICU.   A lot of the nurses have been in more than one hospital and they know what they have to make people feel comfortable there. It's one of the greatest things about being there, because you can always talk to someone else who has actually been there and felt what they experienced.As I've gotten older, the stress of being a patient has helped me to become a lot stronger.   I'm not the easiest person to be around, but I know that I'm a better person because of them. I am a good listener and I don't get into arguments too often. I really listen to what our families are saying and their concerns, and that seems to help, too.Why have you chosen this specific hospital?It's really hard for me to think of anything other than the NICU, because every day is a new day.   Every day I have at least two new patients that we have to manage. This way I have been able to get to know many patients and patients' families. I think that it will also have helped me to be the person that I need to be in order to handle everything that is going on, because I know that I am strong and able to do just fine.I'm a really strong person and I would like to think that has helped me. In your book, you
The following blog post, unless otherwise noted, was written by a member of Gamasutra's community.The thoughts and opinions expressed are those of the writer and not Gamasutra or its parent company.Welcome to my first guide post! First off:I need to say a few things to help us all understand where I'm going. (This is my first guide.)First of all: What is "Racing"?Race is a way of expressing yourself. It is a way of defining your character when making a character, and it is a way to define your identity with other people. Race is a social expression, and it is a part of a larger and more complex topic.First off: Race is a way of expressing yourself.Race is a way of expressing yourself. It is a way of defining your character when making a character, and it is a way to define your identity with other people. Race is a social expression, and it is a part of a larger and more complex topic.The way we interact with others will be defined by the way we feel that interact.There are people like me: non-white, Asian, gay, etc. If you want to interact with someone like me, you need to understand a little background before you talk to them. The "background" of being non-white in this day and age is still a bit of an unknown, but you can get a good idea of it from watching movies and reading books.If you want to read a good book on it, read The Color of Success by Michelle Tea, or even better, go read the book now (that is not on Amazon, by the way)The Color of Success by Michelle Tea: The color of success is the color most often associated with success and success-seeking, and it is a good idea to understand how it works.I won't go into as much detail as Tea does, because much of the subjectivity is already in the book, but I will give the broad strokes.The color of success is the color most often associated with success and success-seeking, and it is a good idea to understand how it works.In the case of racism, for many, race is very important and defining aspects of your life and career. Race is an extremely important part of how we think of ourselves and how we view others. When you hear "I'm a racist" you are often thinking of a person who, by definition, sees themselves as the "race that is superior."You are also a racist if you are racially biased. And that is one of the most difficult parts to deal with - racism. Racism is not a one-time thing; it is an aspect of who we are (and what we do) and it is an inherent part of who we are and what we do.Racism, as defined by the dictionary, is racism when someone believes, "I am superior because of my race." So, racism is the belief, "I am superior because of my race," the thought process behind it, and the actions that reflect it.As the above definition points out, racism is also something we do.When we say "I am a racist" we are talking about ourselves, and it's not just about us, it about how we see our relationships with others, and it is also something we feel when we interact with others.Racism is very often present in everyday speech and most of the conversations in "normal" social contexts. If you are white, and you walk into a restaurant, your waitress, hostess, or waiter is likely white. I know that's obvious, but it's an important distinction to make. It's easy to be racist towards black and brown people, and easy to become racist towards white people. To understand how easy it is to get carried away, think of the worst racism you've experienced in your life, and try to imagine how easy it was to get in trouble by thinking a racist thought.So, with that said, let's talk about race within the context of the video game world.I want, as an indie developer, to be able to talk to other people and get feedback. We want to create things that appeal to everyone, and people will come up with their own ways to talk about games and people.But how?I do not want to hear "You're so ugly!" or "He's fat!" It might make me uncomfortable to be told these things, but I don't want someone making a big deal out of it.I would still want to talk to said person. But it will not be the same as if someone made a big deal out of calling me the n-word. It has not, for the most part, been part of my life. It hasn't changed how I live my life
Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption Researchers found that even a small drop in blood sugar can result in a fall in alertness, concentration and memoryA small drop in blood sugar can result in a significant drop in cognitive function and alertness, a study of mice has found.Scientists found that even a small drop in blood sugar can lead to a substantial fall across several brain areas.They say it suggests that the brain might be able to detect a small change in blood sugar and alter its levels accordingly.The study is published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).The findings could have major implications for the treatment of people who are acutely hungry or have diabetes or type 2 diabetes.The PNAS authors said they believed the findings might have significant potential for the treatment of diseases such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's.This is an incredibly important experiment - I think it will provide scientists with clues to how the brain works Dr John-Dylan Haynes, National Institute on Aging, USDr John-Dylan Haynes, director of The National Institute on Aging, US, said: "This is an incredibly important experiment - I think it will provide scientists with clues to how the brain works."Lead researcher Dr Peter Gasser, from New York University, said: "Blood sugar can cause a lot of harm in our brains because it can cause inflammation."This inflammation can cause other changes and, by interfering with blood sugar, you may affect brain health."Our aim was to see how blood sugar levels are controlled in the brain and what they do."The scientists wanted to learn how the brain deals with glucose and insulin levels inside the nervous system and how those levels change when sugar levels in the blood become too low and insulin levels increase.They first looked at the effects of various levels of glucose in the food we eat.What happens in the brain?This suggests that changes in one part of the brain may act on changes in another part of the brain to affect the functioning of the whole brain in some way Dr Peter Gasser, New York University.In tests involving both mice and rats, the researchers found that even a minor drop in blood sugar led to a significant drop in cognitive function and alertness and was followed by a period of brain fog.A small amount of glucose can also cause the body to release insulin rapidly and produce large amounts of it, which the researchers say may be a key factor in reducing glucose levels in the brain.Dr Gasser said: "We did see some of these effects in the rats, as well. When glucose in the blood was kept steady, it had no effects in the rats."But when glucose dropped, it produced a significant drop in alertness in the rats and a significant drop in memory and concentration and memory, and in many cases, that drop in alertness was more severe that the drop in alertness in the low glucose groups."He said these findings were important in the long term because they showed that blood sugar was important to the processing of information and the ability to do everyday tasks.
What Is the Average Salary of a Major League Player?What Is the Average Salary of a Major League Player?By Jason MooreBaseball salaries are all over the place when it comes to the level of money that is paid to those who play a game that pays over 20 million dollars per year. From $60,000 a year to $600,000 a year. So, what is the average MLB player that might be earning? In the interest of being as thorough as possible, here are some of the most common estimates for the average MLB salary that have been put out by various news outlets and sites in the past.If you're looking for a detailed overview of all the salary information, see the article What is the Average Salary of a Major League Baseball Players?The New York TimesThe New York Times had a very large list of salary reports but it only included salaries for the top 75 players in the big leagues. It was published in 2008. Here are their estimates for 2009, 2010, and 2011.• $2 million for the first year on a contract signed after the end of the 1997 season• $3 million for the second season on a contract signed after the end of the 1998 season• $4 million for the third season on a contract signed after the end of the 1999 season• $5 million for the fourth season on a contract signed after the end of the 2000 season• $6 million for the fifth season on a contract signed after the end of the 2001 season• $7.7 million for the sixth season on a contract signed after the end of the 2002 season• $10.9 million for the seventh season on a contract signed after the end of the 2003 season• $11.5 million for the eighth season on a contract signed after the end of the 2004 season.• $13.3 million for the ninth season on a contract signed after the end of the 2005 season• $15.1 million for the tenth season on a contract signed after the end of the 2006 season• $16.7 million for the eleventh season on a contract signed after the end of the 2007 season.• $21.5 million for the twelfth season on a contract signed after the end of the 2008 season.The New York PostThe Post estimated in a 2006 article that the highest amount of pay was only $15 million. It was an estimated salary to go with bonuses that had been added to every contract signed since 1998.• The first $15 million was earmarked for bonuses that were being rewarded for winning the World Series• The total bonuses were $18 million, including $12 million for winning the 2007 World Series• The next $45 million in bonuses was paid after the 2008 season• The total bonuses were $44 million, the last part of which was due to be paid in the 2010 season• The total was due to be paid to be distributed to the clubs for signing bonuses, bonuses for winning the Triple Crown and bonus money for winning a Gold Glove• For the 2009 season, $5 million more was expected. However, the Nationals, who made a run at the 2009 American League East Division championship, did not sign any of their players until early September 2009.• The Nationals received $28 million in their $45 million bonus pool, $9 million in the first three days, and about $6 million from the final three daysUSA TodayThe most recent USA Today estimate was for 2008. It was about $14.3 million.• $14,320 annually, which includes about $3 million in salaries; the league's minimum salary, an additional $3.75 million; and an additional $1.5 million in bonuses.• A contract signed after the 2001 season is valued at about $13,000,000• If you add back bonuses that were not paid due to the Nationals missing the playoffs, you would come up a very large $17,000,000• If the Nationals don't sign at least one player during the season to a contract that includes a bonus equal to the minimum salary, those bonuses are still taken out of the total bonus poolThe Washington PostThe Post has only provided an estimate of the 2007 salary, so we have to take into account the possibility that the salary could have been increased significantly during the offseason.• $15.8 million for the first year on a contract signed after the end of the 1998 season• $15.8 million for the second year on a contract signed after the end of the 1998 season• $16.3 million for the third season on a contract signed after the end of the 1999 season• $18.2 million for the fourth season on a contract signed after the end of the
What is it about the world of "Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D." that has so many people hooked. It's smart, entertaining, has amazing acting, and never misses an opportunity to get a little gross as well. From the mind of Joss Whedon and his production team of Jeph Loeb, Jed Whedon, Smith, and Drew Pearce, "Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D," is the product of the best of all of America. And when it comes down to it, these characters and plot lines are as American as apple pie, baseball, American history, and American football. Even after an extended hiatus from the series, there are still ways to enjoy the show. One of the most underrated pleasures is the fan-made "Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D." comic series which was published by Dark Horse Comics. The comic series focuses on many of the fan-favorite characters on the show such as Bobbie Draper/Mockingbird, Lance Hunter/Beast, and Leo Fitz/Skye. It's a wonderful, fun read for those that want to get an even further insight into the world of "Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D." and can't make it to the show. Here are 15 "Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D." comics that are perfect for fans of the show.Continue scrolling to keep reading Click the button below to start this article in quick view Share Tweet Email Copy Link Copiedadvertising15 SkyeThe only female character that has ever managed to survive in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the character of Skye can be described as super-smart, but not super-powerful, and is usually paired up with a guy. This makes Skye a good fit for the comics that focuses on her life in the United States, specifically her love for the show. Here, we see her at her worst, but in the comic, when she needs the most, she seems just as smart as the heroes she's teamed up with. This comic series gives readers a look into Skye's childhood while she's studying at Columbia University. She's also getting a bad reputation for her crazy antics after the team discovers she's pregnant.14 Lincoln CampbelladvertisingThe name "Lincoln Campbell" doesn't do justice to his many achievements in the world of science and technology. Lincoln Campbell was a member of the Strategic Scientific Reserve. The S.S.R was an organization created by Robert Oppenheimer in order to ensure the safety of the United states. Campbell served as the head of S.S.R. and was known widely by the name he chose for himself at the beginning of the series "Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D." "Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.," explores what it's like to be under the watchful eye of the S.S.R. Campbell serves as a mentor for Skye, but it's Lincoln that can have the most impact on the character. The comic series portrays Campbell as a smart and knowledgeable scientist that seems to know things that Skye doesn't. While it's hard to believe that Campbell wasn't a part of the S.H.I.E.L.D. team, "Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D." doesn't shy away from showing him working behind the scenes as the new head of S.H.I.E.L.D. We've learned a lot from Lincoln and we're glad to see that the new "Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D." series will let fans take a deeper look into his role to see what role he has for "Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."13 FitzadvertisingFitz seems like the most unlikely of the group of heroes that makes up the "Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D." team. This guy is literally, a fox. We all know Fitz and he's the reason why Coulson can always get what he wants even if its something that might just be illegal in our world. While the show shows him to be someone with a "nice" side, the comic series shows a completely different side of Fitz which is just as scary. His story starts when he learns that he's a mutant, which causes him to run away just to be alone. Fitz's character also evolves through multiple adventures in the comic series. This series also explores what motivates Fitz to be the scientist that he is with a story that ties in with the events of the show which gives fans another reason to like Fitz and hope that "Marvel's Agents of S.H.I
BENGALURU: In a bid to create an inclusive ecosystem for women entrepreneurs, the Karnataka government has announced a package of incentives worth Rs 15 crore for all businesses owned by and run by women and their kin.Under the Special Incentive Package announced last month and under which women can avail special tax incentives, the government will extend tax rate relief up to 30% to businesses of women-owned entities and their kin.Under the new provisions of the Taxation Laws (Amendment) Act, 2015 (TILA), the state government will compensate the tax paid on the investment made by a business by a women's-owned, sister-in-law-run or widow-run business or other entities where both the owners are women.This will be up to a maximum of 25% tax. The exemption from tax will carry to the business owner, both women-owned and sister-in-law-run enterprises and their kin.A business owned by a woman or a woman-in-law can avail special tax incentives under the TILA from 2015 onwards."Karnataka has long been successful in attracting FDI. This will be a big attraction to venture capital funds from around the world looking to fund women-led business," Revenue minister G Parameshwara said.The incentives will be announced simultaneously to attract foreign funds into Bengaluru's SME corridor, he added. Parameshwara cited the example of a woman-led IT startup that was supported by the Karnataka government by bringing in foreign funds from a foreign fund through the TILA.According to the Revenue minister, the incentive will provide relief to women-owned firms that invest Rs 25 lakh in their enterprise and the cost of goods sold. Besides, the new provisions will encourage women to enter the sector and invest in IT sectors which will generate employment opportunities in the country.
Shenzhen Geely Group is set to deliver its first autonomous car next month, a major milestone in the Chinese company's push into the US market.The company, which currently makes only its flagship electric car, the Geely car:E, is set to build and deliver a driverless vehicle at Beijing's Nangang Technical University in Changsha province in the month of September, sources close to the company say.According to the sources, this announcement will be made on Monday, September 7 in the company's first quarterly earnings report as part of the company's announcement period.The news is sure to come as a blow to Uber rival Didi Chuxing, which is expected to make its own official announcement this week.The electric car maker Didi recently launched its own autonomous vehicle pilot program, and the company is reportedly set to unveil its own fully autonomous vehicle later this year.Meanwhile, a year ago, Geely, a division of the billionaire Geely Holding Group, announced that it was making major investments in self-driving and autonomous technology technology, and even stated that its company would produce an autonomous car by the end of 2016.Since the announcement, the company has been quietly ramping up production from 1,000 cars a month at the time to more than 10,000 a month.Meanwhile, other Chinese giants are also eyeing the US market, such as local-based Baidu and homegrown JD.com.Geely Automobile Ltd has been a part of the China market since 1997.
You can also look at some of my "favorite" articles and blogs to learn more about how to get started with this field of study and apply it yourself.I hope you enjoyed a few minutes of my time learning about the various aspects and tools of this field. Let me know what you think and if you are considering some of my previous ideas that are related to learning and implementing the data science field. Please comment below!* * * * *A few days ago I posted a data visualization that demonstrates the power of Big Data. I also posted a video and wrote up a blog post about it. One thing I didn't do is share the source code to the data visualisation with you. This is because, even though I am sharing the source codes, I actually don't believe that my data visualization will necessarily be particularly useful. While it was a bit daunting and tedious to get the source code in place, it only takes about a few key minutes to create a data visualisation that is ready for the web, including an interactive map with an overview chart and more. However, if you're interested in what I did, I'm happy to show you how it was done below! (And, of course, I'll show you how I made your own maps with it too.)What's Data Visualization?In short, data visualization is what you do with data. Data visualization allows us to show information about data. This may be through the use of charts, maps, diagrams or graphs. It is used to make sense of data and to display data in an interesting and engaging way. For me, visualising data is a way to make sense of it, to understand the world, and to make decisions about it.Let's take a look at the basic concept of data visualisation from the source.Here is an example visualisation of the "Cost of Attendance" from 2009 to 2013 from the National Center for Education Statistics. Click to see a zoomable version of the image.There is some great data visualisation out there and I'm going to break down this image into the following elements:What's important to know?The key features of the data viz:The size of the dotWhat the dot means for that specific yearHow data is grouped together within this areaWhat the color of the lines on the circle mean.What colors represent each groupYou can see the key features of this plot easily in table form when we are looking at the information.Why Make a Data Visualization?The way that data visualisation is constructed and presented is by using a lot of different types of visualisation. Some are relatively straight forward to make, particularly if you have a decent knowledge of the way they map and represent data, while others require some more coding to create an effective and intuitive result.The basic structure for a data visualisation is relatively simple:Identify the type of content you want to represent with your visuals Visualise the visual content using several different tools (such as tables, maps, bar charts, etc.) Combine the content in your visual with a theme to create an overall visual. Combine the elements in this overall visual to create your final diagram.Here is one of my favorites using tables for the data.Some of the options to use for a typical data viz:Using tablesMapBar chartPie chartTables and pie charts allow the user to see the data directly in front of them rather than having to scroll on a screen for a long time to see something. It takes a fair amount of time to set up and the setup requires a fair amount of knowledge of what each type of table/chart allows and does not allow. However, I am a huge fan of Tables and have enjoyed them for a number of reasons:Easy to learnNo visual cues – no need to know what every single table in your data viz doesIf something is not working, the data must be on a separate pageIt's easy to explain in a short amount of timeHowever, if you like tables, you'll like pie charts too. They are much easier to navigate because they only allow visualizing a certain range of values. They don't have text labels or anything else on them to help us navigate through what is displayed on the table or the chart area.However, one of the main strengths of pie charts and tables is that they are interactive. You are able to click on a point anywhere on the chart and change how much information is displayed on that point. This makes pie charts (and table charts in this case) more intuitive because it makes the visualization more dynamic. This makes pie charts (and table charts in this case) more intuitive because it makes the visualization more dynamic. When you change what is displayed on a point, it changes what is displayed
Cleveland Browns star wide receiver Josh Gordon is out four weeks, but he might not be out much longer.NFL Media Insider Ian Rapoport reported that Gordon's rehab is progressing well, and that the wideout has a good chance to return for Week 2 against the New York Jets.The former Ohio State star was suspended in September after testing positive for the substance that prompted his suspension. Gordon is eligible to return on Monday, Oct. 4 after he does a supervised workout.While that's a relatively quick return for Gordon, who is rehabbing from torn ACL surgery, it is not an ideal comeback for the 25-year-old.After returning from his second ACL surgery in 2016, Gordon is scheduled to do some light running this offseason -- likely along the offensive line -- in some games leading up to the season opener.After missing the bulk of the 2015 season after being arrested in September on drug possession charges (while playing for the Cleveland Browns), Gordon managed a mere 48 receptions for 584 yards and two touchdowns in six games last season.The fifth overall pick out of Oklahoma in the 2010 NFL draft missed the first half of last season due to a hamstring injury that required surgery, but Rapoport is told that the Browns plan to give Gordon an "extended look" before next Monday's deadline to make his 2015 season report."No. He's working hard," coach Hue Jackson told NFL Media's Michelle Beisner. "He's at our facility working on technique, on hand fighting, he's been working on the run game, working on receiving, working on blocking in the run game, just being around the guys and his teammates ... I think that he'll be more consistent."The Browns expect Gordon to be much better this season, having added a healthy tight end in Gary Barnidge in the offseason. Jackson did reveal however, that the team had hoped to get Gordon on the field in Week 8 against the Ravens, but a hamstring issue took him out of action that fateful week.Now that Gordon plans to be fully recovered before the Bengals on Monday, it's conceivable that he could have a full roster by Week 3, just in time to make a splash against the Texans.The latest Around The NFL Podcast recaps every game from Week 7 and debates whether Johnny Manziel belongs in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

The UH system's new science building can be seen in the distance from the Rotunda on Thursday, Sept. 9, 2009.(KUTV) "UH has just discovered some new stuff.""I think that's quite the understatement."The excitement was evident last week when University of Utah scientists in the University of Utah College of Arts and Sciences and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration released the latest finding in their ongoing study of the weather in the West.The team led by UH atmospheric scientist and researcher Robert Kopp described in a paper scheduled to be published in the January issue of Geophysical Research Letters a new technique to predict the behavior of a large portion of the world's ocean. This new ocean current prediction technique is the latest in a series of research conducted over the past two decades by scientists across the school and elsewhere, but this time the research was focused on measuring and modeling a massive body of water – the North Pacific Gyre, or NPG. It is the largest ocean current in the world.While the West Coast of North America experiences an average of one hurricane a year, the NPG produces an extraordinary rate of hurricane-force wind events. The average of just eight hurricanes in a lifetime of only 300 years is amazing; the NPG has produced at least 50 major hurricanes. For a comparison of the intensity of North America's hurricanes vs. the North Pacific, the U.S. averages about one major hurricane in a lifetime of 1,200 years. The NPG is also producing a lot of flooding, as evidenced in the flood damage that occurred during Hurricane Odile during the weekend of Jan. 26-27 this year.Kopp, a professor in the Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences at UH, studies a wide array of ocean water conditions and trends related to climate, biology, and other sciences. His research is directed towards understanding how the ocean acts as a large freshwater storage reservoir for precipitation and runoff.During the past 30 years, Kopp has been collaborating with other ocean experts to map and characterize these gyres. By comparing these maps with actual hurricane data collected over the past 50 to 80 years, he has been able to develop global models of the ocean current's behavior and its relationship to hurricane activity. Kopp described the current paper as an update to those earlier models, which now include the NPG."A key piece of our study was to get a feel for how large the ocean's gyre is and how the current is distributed along its circumference," Kopp said. "This is a big question because if you think about the global ocean and how our global climate system works, we don't directly experience any large regions of stagnant water. We get our water from tides from the ocean, but the water flows in a cycle that is really complex and it's not obvious exactly how it's flowing."We're able to quantify that water movement, especially when water rises in places like the ocean from deep wells, where it has formed salt water in the first place. In a place like the NPG, there's so much water moving – it's an ocean in the making – and we're able to see those ocean motions. You can think about the Earth as a vast, ocean-sized reservoir of water and we're able to calculate the currents that push that water around. That gives us a pretty good idea of how the water flow in the gyres, but now the question's how does that water move around through the ocean?"There are two major ocean water masses that Kopp studies, one, the Southern Ocean and the other the North Pacific. The North Pacific is the more important of the two because the gyres there are bigger than that of the Southern Ocean. The gyres in both regions are very stable. The current there is extremely cold and the gyre circulation is very steady."In the Southern Ocean gyres, there tends to be a lot of ups and downs," Kopp said. "The current is fairly steady and then the ocean gets very cold because the ocean is relatively close to the top of its gyre and it's very difficult for the water to move in different directions – it's sort of like a pendulum that moves left or right with a small constant force of gravity. That water can travel down the ocean floor, but it's really not moving much water."In the NPG gyre, the water circulation is actually very complex. It's a river-like current, it's quite fast and as it flows it does create an interesting ripple in the ocean floor. However that is so slow that it's almost undetectable. It's a different ocean than the Southern Ocean, but there is a very large amount of water moving, probably around 200 miles per hour (300 km/hr), and that's why the NPG produces more hurricanes than the Southern."When looking at the historical record, Kopp said that it
I bought this because I was worried that the large hole the light comes into would break the seal on a small flashlight.I had been thinking about buying another flashlight with a similar size as the Nitecore, but it seems the same size as the Nichia 219. The Nitecore is 1x longer, just about the height of the battery, and a good 50 grams. However, the price difference is negligible. This light is a huge step up in quality.First off, there's no visible light leak. While this is a nice feature, it's also the cause for many people to leave the light on for hours or days at a time. This is not what's designed to happen, but it's an unfortunate side effect of doing the lighting right.This light is very solid, and while you can't tell the difference in weight when wearing it, compared to a comparable Nitecore, the head is bigger (and I do mean bigger). It's a bit heavier than a standard light of similar size, but definitely fits my head very well. The head isn't as tight as some other brands which might be due to the thickness of the threads. The head is also a lot more compact than what some other lights can make me feel, I guess.This is a nice little light, although it doesn't have any real low light functionality, but it can be run as a head-lamp. For $30 and $30 dollars, you just can't beat this.
The best way to learn the basics of a certain language is by speaking it to someone else. The same principle applies to learning a new tool.Learn by doingYou can learn a lot by trying it out.The most important thing to remember when using new tools is:Use it once. Learn it. Share your experience. And repeat.That's really it.And if the tool is not ready to be used in production, you probably shouldn't use it at all.In this blog post, I want to talk about the most basic of the beginner's problems: getting familiarized with a new tool:You've just installed a new tool for the first time.You've done a quick test run with it.You've played around with a few commands on localhost.You've seen a few errors thrown by the tool.You've spent some time thinking about why the tool doesn't behave nicely like you expect it to.What should you do?You can start by experimenting with the tool's behavior on your own.But this is the wrong approach.I would recommend you to continue learning by using the tool in the context of more typical usage.The reason for this is because this technique will help to get you a better understand the tool's nature. It will help you identify possible issues. And eventually help you to work out what exactly the tool should be doing.After doing some tests on different environments, I've concluded the following:You should use the tool once.The tool will work only when used.You can't rely on the tool working as expected the very first time.To learn the tool by doing and experimenting is like trying to learn a new language by getting used to the rules of a foreign language by reading books.For a beginner to really master a new language, it is best to start learning in a foreign environment.For a second language, maybe even a language you're already familiar with, start with a language you're not familiar with at all.I've seen many beginners struggling with learning a tool that they've never used before while continuing to do the exact same thing they were previously doing when it comes to the new tool.That's just the opposite of what you want to happen:You'll learn the tool by doing and experiment (i.e. "knowing").But instead, you should be trying things out and trying to understand why it isn't working as you expect it to.Learn by doing by readingNow that we've discussed the basics of how to learn a new language by using it in a "real life" situation, let's talk about learning by reading.It's one of the best and easiest ways to learn what to do:Learn by doing without trying.The most important thing is to focus on what you want to learn. It should be something you want to achieve.Once you get started, you will probably get lost and confused.What do I mean by lost and confused?That's what happened to me. It's normal when you start learning a different language. You get lost, confused, and lose hope.But what you need to work on first is to focus on things you know. In other words, things that you can do using a language.The things you do when learning a language:Interact with the language.Practical use.How to speak.Usefully interact.Learn by reading the most common mistakes from newbies.This means you have to learn the most common mistakes from the people who are doing the most common things.What to do nextSo we've discussed how to learn a tool using it in a "real life" situation.Now it's time to go back and re-learn the tool through practical use.This means:Listening to its behavior when used in practice.Exploring the issues caused by the tool.Understanding why and how.You can start with this technique by using this list to guide you through:Listening to the tool's behavior under realistic situations.Discovering why the tool is not behaving well in the same way as in your own tests.Understanding the real situation of the tool you want to learn using listening to it under realistic situations.Exploring the issues caused by the tool under realistic scenarios.Understanding the real situation of the tool you want to learn using experimentation.Once you're comfortable working with the tool in the context of realistic scenarios, you can continue to learn the tool by doing.But now that you know what to do with the tool, learn it by doing
The world of television is a lot like the world of politics: you need to get your message out there, and not just by using media, you also need to persuade the public. How many times do you see these two worlds colliding in prime time?Case in point, last week's episode of Grey's Anatomy. While we knew that Ellen Harper's character would ultimately die in the upcoming season, we didn't know exactly how or what it would entail. Luckily, star Patrick Dempsey made the most of it. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he spilled a few tidbits. "I think that's really going to play into how the world gets to know her.""It's not going to be that simple, obviously," he said. "People know her. They all know who she is. They know who she's with. They know she's in the hospital. It's going to be a really, really interesting journey. It's really going to be an emotional journey for viewers, so when you are waiting for the doctor to pull the plug, there's definitely some waiting around as well."That's definitely not typical showrunner fare, but Dempsey isn't the only one to take this path. Last year, showrunner Shonda Rhimes revealed that fans could expect some heartbreak in last season's finale when Maggie and Alex were reunited because of a secret. It's been a year since Maggie died during surgery, but it looks like Alex and her husband won't be seeing each other anytime soon.While this was a good twist for fans to keep an eye out, this latest revelation could be even better. The world of Grey's Anatomy doesn't only operate in the reality that it creates for the characters. Some of their storylines are also inspired by real events. One episode this season, for example, involved two young children getting together in order to save one of their parents from a killer. Although it never played out this way, it's a good example of how the show's characters view the world outside: reality and fiction.If you need to get a hold of Dempsey sooner, he's signed with HBO to appear in upcoming films, including the highly-anticipated sequel to Snow White and the Huntsman.
The European Parliament has the power to decide, in principle, whether to grant Bulgaria accession to the Union.Bulgaria is not, by itself, a member of the European Union and has not been since its accession in 2004, though it does have access to the European Economic Area (EEA) through its EU membership.However, the European Commission has expressed an interest in opening accession negotiations with Bulgaria.Accession negotiations must be held on a case-by-case basis because of the EU's freedom of movement laws and the rules governing the adoption of the national laws by the national parliaments.An accession decision can be made in principle and not in a law. It can also be decided on the basis of a recommendation from the Council.An accession decision can be taken after the conclusion of a preparatory conference at which experts discuss the application and the interpretation of the Treaty.These meetings take place at the European Council of Heads of State and Government in June 2014, and then at the European Council in December 2014. Both meetings are usually held in Brussels.A decision on a possible accession by the European Parliament to the EEA is taken at a meeting of political group leaders (the "Council decision") in October 2018 after a discussion of all the national representatives of interest.The Council will discuss the EU and the EEA Accession Agenda at its next meeting, which will take place in January 2019.
Rio Olympics: The best photos from Australia's winUpdatedFor a long time it looked like Australia would miss out on a medal in the Rio Olympics after being thrashed in the semi-finals of the equestrian event.We have been able to shed a bit more light on the race ahead, and it has to be said the way you would expect the Australian team to look after missing out for Australia for Rio in such a big way.We are the country that invented the modern pony; the sport that was supposed to break free from its long-held, largely-unwritten association with women like Rosie Jones; and we were supposed to be the shining example of a post-feminist, post-gay marriage, post-everything Australian society …Not that those dreams have been quite fulfilled.The horse, the horseAustralia has always had one of the stronger track and field teams per capita in the world, and a strong track and field team is what got a team of five Australian Olympic medalists to the podium today.At the start of the competition, they trailed Britain by 3-1 in the medal table.Then things began to get more interesting ...They came back and won all five of the races, and in the final. In the end, their team-mate, Katie Taylor, rode them home.Her third place in the event meant that she won the team gold.But Australia really needed to win five events to win gold ... They missed out in the final by just a few hundredths of a second.I think everyone was a bit surprised by that. They had been playing very well and seemed to be finding their feet more and more with each event.But the team is a collective ... The way it came in in their semi-final was pretty stunning.The raceIn the race that started everyone's collective heart racing, they had the British looking very vulnerable at the right-hand turn.The Australians were able to keep well clear, then rode away.As they pulled away, I remember them shouting 'go home, go home', but then that's pretty much how they got home.But again they just got so close and that was really important.In the final there was a big drop when the Australians came round the turn, and they went into it and just kept climbing.But, again, they just couldn't quite make the extra gear and just kept on going.On the day, the Americans were in the chase and came close a couple of times.You could see it in their legs. But Australia pulled away from them and took the gold medal.You could really see that the horses had done their job. They did what they had done to put the Australian race away.The celebrationsWhen we came back home ... that was the most amazing thing about it. When they lined up with the rest of the team and lined up under lights to get a huge cheer, it just shows you what that team means.This race meant that Australian athletes were finally able to celebrate as equals.It's a very different sport to the Olympic horse. When the horse finishes, he sits down and he walks away from the race.When the horse sits down and they line up at the finish ... They're very much up front. It means a lot more, and it does seem fitting they get a gold medal with those words.The mediaOne of the problems we saw in Rio was that it was so hard to find a fair bit of information about the Australian team as it broke apart on the night.As they went to the showers and they came out, they were just completely lost over whether they'd done great or whether they'd done nothing at all.I remember thinking to myself, do we have to do that?We have some of the best reporters in the world in a sense.In the case of the equestrian event, you need them to get the facts out as it breaks.I don't think even I would do it if it didn't have the benefit that everyone's rights had been taken care of, and I would want to know the truth.And with that there's a certain amount of pride that comes along with not just being able to talk to the athletes and the team-mates and know that they're alright.You know, there's got to be a price to be paid for that.The athletesThe athletes, especially in these situations ... As the Olympics go on, they don't take it for granted, but when the Games start and they step into that arena ... There's a lot of emotion and focus there.It's almost like ... a big test.But you know what ... The Olympics are
What will it bring to the table that it hasn't already done, what new technology will it require to make it go even faster, and what will those customers want to pay for? The answer to all these questions and more are revealed in our fourth annual Hardware Summit.For 2014 Hardware Summit, we asked top hardware executives about the future of hardware and their plans. Here are some of the key takeaways from their responses:3D sensors like Microsoft's Kinect, Razer's Forge and Razer's Naga Hydra can be used to make the technology that already exists much more accurate. That helps reduce processing power, which can improve both performance on existing hardware, and on next-gen machines."When Intel first showed off the first Pentium chip, one of the slides talked about how Pentiums took 20 nanoseconds to do one instruction.""The next time Intel shows a slide about how Pentiums handle loads of data, take one step back and remember what an Intel Pentium is, and what a Pentium 2 did. It's a lot faster.""The next great advance of the computing world will be the ability to use the brain to make the machines smarter.""The next big hardware and software leap won't come from the CPU, it will come from the GPU," said a top exec.There's an ever-changing group of hardware and software engineers who can do remarkable things, but only a few take that next step. It is likely that 3D sensors and new, better CPU/GPU architectures will be the next big leap that takes hardware to a whole new range of new capabilities and brings the cloud of the computing world a whole lot closer. "We're making good progress, but we're not there yet." said one top engineer.What's more, "We can put 4K content on a PC, but they don't come cheap anymore. That was the great leap forward, and it's starting to get to be a cost of being there" said an executive.Intel's latest generation of desktop CPUs are in some ways worse than their predecessors. The chips are more power hungry and they aren't as much faster. "The old processors [coupled to a Pentium 4, for example] were 30% faster than the latest," said a tech expert. "The next step is where they're at, and it's 20% less. How many of us can get away with using the same old graphics cards?""The PC platform has been completely broken, and now we need to figure how to fix it."As part of Intel's strategy to make the PC work even better, the company has started to work with the cloud to enable software to interact with devices inside the device. "Intel is the only one that can make the device work with your content from the cloud. It's not as easy to do as Microsoft might have you believe, but it can work." said a technical expert.There's still nothing really holding back new, cloud-based products, however. "It's actually faster and safer to share content between devices than to have to take every extra step," stated a CEO. "For us, the cloud is a big opportunity to bring down the cost of cloud computing in the consumer space, while opening up a massive new ecosystem to developers.""The cloud is the big gamechanger, and not being able to buy a PC now is a big mistake." said another executive.When Apple announced new Macs a few weeks ago, it also introduced the Retina display. For companies and individuals that might have considered buying a non-Retina display for the Mac Pro, it could mean the end of that investment. "You might see a decline in Mac Pro sales." said a tech executive.

After an investigation by the Florida Department of Health, a man was charged with second-degree murder and assault with a deadly weapon in the death of a woman who died in an accident at a Florida beach on Wednesday afternoon, authorities said.The woman, 27, died after crashing into the water at the Gulf Bank Regional Park as she was doing yard work. A male companion told investigators that the woman fell from the sand barrier as she was working on a boardwalk, said State Attorney Jeff Ashton, the county's chief prosecutor.Investigators say the male companion dropped the woman off on a nearby embankment near the beach a few hours later and that he did not call an ambulance until the next morning.Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowA beachgoer walking on the boardwalk heard her screams and went to help, authorities said.

New Hampshire Gov. Maggie Hassan announced Wednesday (Dec. 7) her support for legalizing all drugs with the exception of alcohol and tobacco.Sens. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) and Angus King (I-Maine) have introduced the Marijuana Policy Project's (MPP) Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol Act (SAM). The legislation would remove alcohol and tobacco from the Controlled Substances Act's list of drugs that can be legally sold without a prescription.Under the proposal, marijuana would be classified as a Schedule II drug, a more restrictive category of restricted substances that prohibit possession, distribution, manufacture, and sales. But instead of criminalizing marijuana possession, the bill calls for a licensing system where registered medical marijuana and marijuana-infused products stores would be taxed and licensed to sell.The bill also says that no marijuana will be taxed by the state or local government, and that the Drug Enforcement Agency will not be able to raid or investigate individuals and businesses who are in compliance with the law. It provides some exceptions to those protections, however.Hassan said Thursday she will support the bill, as well as the Compassionate Care Act, but will have further discussion with the Maine Department of Health to see if there are other ways to alleviate marijuana's stigma as medicine.Hassan, a Democrat, spoke at a New Hampshire Drug Policy Action Council meeting in Manchester and said she wants to reduce the stigma associated with marijuana and help more patients get access to treatment. Her announcement came one day after the New Hampshire House of Representatives approved the Compassionate Care Act, which would allow patients with qualifying conditions the option to use up to one strain of marijuana.Hassan was one of four governors to sign on to MPP's state-level "Marijuana Stands with Maggie" campaign that was launched earlier this month, and she and other state officials are scheduled to participate in the first national marijuana law reform conference in California next month."If there was one issue that brought everyone together it would be this one," Hassan said. "This isn't about legalizing a substance. This is about legalizing a natural substance used by a lot of people in New Hampshire."
The U.S. Senate this week approved a bill that would block the Obama administration's rule requiring employers to guarantee birth control coverage to their female workers.The 60-37 vote in the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) was a victory for employers and the Tea Party.The Obama administration issued the new rules last year, requiring major health-insurance companies to cover birth control without a co-pay in their health plans.The rules were widely opposed by the Catholic Church, which is suing the federal government to block them.The Senate vote was largely along party lines, with only three Republicans joining all 50 Democrats in opposing the bill: Susan Collins (Maine), Mike Enzi (Wyoming) and Jerry Moran (Kan.).The Republicans had previously passed similar measures in the House.The Obama administration has repeatedly argued that the requirement to cover birth control could force some small business owners to close or let their workers opt out of their coverage altogether.Democrats and many religious organizations backed the new regulations, even though some said the coverage would make women feel coerced into having sex, forcing them to have sex but not using contraception.Obama defended the new birth control requirement, saying that it will give women access to the kinds of contraceptives they want to use without co-payments but not without government regulation that could force them to go against their beliefs.But several business-backed groups slammed Obama's decision to enact one of his biggest accomplishments and urged that women should receive a free rider on the insurance, by which they are subsidized in the form of an extra government check."The only cost covered is for the government's money," said the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty.The Catholic Bishops and several other Catholic organizations called the administration's policy "unnecessary and immoral" and a violation of religious freedom.The Church has been involved in ongoing debates about contraception in the U.S., arguing that its employees should have the choice to receive access to contraceptives through other means such as their health insurance.Many U.S. Catholics are Catholic or Protestant with different views on the issue.The U.S. Catholic Bishops argued that even in cases where the birth control was purchased on the job, the government is forcing employers to pay for it."The cost of contraceptive health care is already included in the cost of providing health insurance, something that is often not provided to others," said the bishops.The Church says this is not the case, however.Some conservative leaders argued that there was no room for a compromise, that the new regulation was so sweeping that it was forcing employers to violate their religious beliefs.

DALLAS -- On Thursday night, the Minnesota Wild moved closer to becoming just the fourth team in NHL history to clinch an NHL Divisional Playoff spot on their first playoff appearance since the salary cap was introduced in 2005-06.The Wild have a chance to do that with a win tonight against the Dallas Stars, who lost 6-1 at Chicago on Wednesday. Minnesota will likely hold onto the Wild Card for the second round against Detroit or Chicago. Both have three fewer games played in the wild card race than Minnesota, as does Dallas.Dallas (44 points) and Minnesota (41 points) are tied atop the Central Division, though the Wild won their lone playoff series against the Stars last season, before falling to them in seven games in the second round.The Wild, meanwhile, will have the opportunity to tie a franchise mark of 10 straight road playoff wins and also move into third place in the Central Division in the process.The Wild are 14-7-2 at home in 2013 and 15-4-1 there this season, though both teams have just 15 points through 46 games. They're also tied atop the division with six teams apiece. The teams in a three-way tiebreaker with three points each are Ottawa (39 points), Chicago (40 points), and St. Louis (39 points), while Minnesota is tied with Dallas with one point each.Minnesota has already reached the playoffs four times under first-year Wild coach Mike Yeo, and this will be just the fourth time since the start of the 2004-05 season that Minnesota has gotten there on its first playoff appearance.The Wild, who host the Colorado Avalanche next Tuesday, will have a full week to prepare with their season wrapping up. The NHL will then release the order for Saturday's Game 1 of the Western Conference Final.Here are some key items to watch in the second-round series:WHAT IT MATTERED: Yeo had to decide what to do with a group of forwards who have played a large part in the Wild's recent success. Zach Parise, Ryan Suter, and Marco Scandella all got the day off, and Tyler Graovac was recalled from the Texas Stars to back up Suter. Graovac scored just one goal in five games with the Wild, and it was because of a defensive misplay against Calgary on Wednesday. With Suter's game going on the second night of the team's five-game road trip, many wondered if Minnesota would keep him on the ice in practice to get him out of some extra games.Suter said after Game 5 that he didn't think he could do much more than prepare and get ready for this series. Yeo told him otherwise."I told him I think this is a good time to kind of bring some experience in," Yeo said. "We've got a good opportunity to see how our younger guys are out there. [Graovac] had one day under his belt [because] of the situation with Suter. I think we want to see how he's going to react under that type of adversity. But again, when a guy gets to that point in the playoffs it's time to step up and make a contribution." He did just that when a few plays allowed Calgary to score at 1:33 in the opening period.SHORT-CARD PLAY: Yeo said that after reviewing the game on a delayed-replay replay, he did not make the smart move to bring in Graovac to back up Suter on its home line, only to pull both players out when the Wild had chances to pull even on the score. Graovac finished the game with seven shots, tied for the team lead."You have to do what needs to be done in that situation based on the game plan," Yeo said. "That's how you go about things in a series like we're going into now. Our lineup was what we were going to run this year. As a coach you've got to try to evaluate things throughout the series. You have to keep evaluating things. So the decision was made by me and [Mikko] Koivu to go with it in the third, which is the right thing to go for. I'm glad that we stuck to it."GOOD MONDAY MORNING.THEY SAID IT"I've seen a lot of games in a year, but I've never seen anything like it. He just made every mistake he could on the ice and then they came back and buried some shots." -- Wild captain Mikko Koivu[NBC SHOP: Gear up, Wild fans!]"The Wild have been on the right side of history. Now it's time to go on the right side of history. It's going to be very hard to win." -- Stars forward Mattias Janmark.WHAT WE THINKWe see
The world was shocked by Thursday's deadly terror attack at the Boston Marathon, but a Boston woman is using her tragedy for a purpose she says, "can make this world a better place.""We need this, I feel horrible about the pain this is causing us. I hope this can give these people a little bit of hope," Lauren Bacall said in an interview with the local CBS affiliate.Bacall was at the finish line when a pressure cooker bomb exploded. She sustained injuries to her knee, chest, and back. Two other people were seriously injured. Three others suffered minor injuries.Bacall spoke to CBS News on Thursday morning."I think it's the world that needs to stop and really look at ourselves," she said. "We look back on that night of tragedy with sadness and horror. I think that everyone in this country needs to take a moment."In order to give the injured and the families of the victims a small spark of hope about the future, Bacall launched a fundraising effort called "Boston Strong.""I'm creating a little bit of a social experiment about hope. I want to do something that gives everyone who's watching a little bit of perspective on trying to rebuild our communities, about the need to continue to fight for peace and love," she said.And this is what she's asking people to donate:The goal is $150,000 by Friday. That will be matched by the National Football League."I'd like to see a couple of people get that $150K," Bacall said. "I'd like to see somebody come in with a million dollars."In order to raise enough money to get the project off the ground, Bacall is enlisting the help of some big names in the business world."There are a lot of people who are willing to get behind that cause to help out. Even if it's going to take a ton of money, to really inspire people to come together and get things done," she said.Bacall has been contacted by some corporate leaders who are ready to help. She says she hopes to use her connection to corporate America to help spread some hope, not only in Boston, but all across the nation."If we can do something like this, it can hopefully make people understand that people do do something to fix things. And we do make changes," Bacall said.Bacall is holding a meet and greet to raise money for those who have been injured as a result of the attack. You can find the fundraiser on her website, www.bostonstrongfundraiser.org. But don't forget to send that check to her."All I really want is to see this person smile today so that maybe I don't have to feel the grief and the pain and the sadness," she said.
"When the sun rose, the clouds were clear. The sky was dark. And they did battle." —The Princess Bride, chapter 1The Battle of the Somme (June 1st-9th) or Verdun was a major clash that took place in France on 1 and 9 July 1916 and marked the beginning of the Battle of the Somme and the beginning of World War 1.As the names suggest, this battle had two aspects: fighting on the field of battle itself ("the Somme") and from a distance during the early stages of the war during which the British army, under General Sir Douglas Haig, fought its way into the trenches and attempted to breach British defenses; and finally at the end of 1916, when the German army and allied forces under Field Marshal Erich von Manstein attacked the British lines and forced them back behind the "No Man's Land" of the Western Front.The Battle of the Somme took place during the First World War, a conflict between Great Britain, a colonial power in what was to become France, and France, a former imperial power and modern state in what became Belgium.Contents show]Background EditBackground EditAs the War of 1914 drew to an end, the Entente powers, including Britain, began to plan for a postwar settlement, beginning with the peace treaty drawn up by the allies on 10 November 1918 at the Hague and codified in the Treaty of Versailles.On the night of 7 and 8 July, British General Sir Henry Wilson sent a dispatch from Ghent, Belgium, to his British commanders in France, Belgium and the Netherlands, detailing how he perceived the Battle of the Somme to be a "decisive test," which the Allies had failed to meet in 1916. The dispatch stated that the fighting in northern France and central Belgium would be "of great duration" and that "the Germans will be forced to give ground again," while for the British forces there should be no respite and a "very difficult and expensive engagement" was inevitable if they were to prevail. Wilson emphasized that a second breakthrough to link up with the Allied forces at the Marne River was to be expected as the British began their advance against the German lines in the north. In addition, the Allies were to seize and hold several key bridges linking the Allied advance in Belgium and northwest France with the southern Allied forces.As the battle began, the British Army was not ready for the German reaction to its breakout. While the Germans held a strong position at the River Somme, their front was broken and their force lost much of its momentum and cohesion. British troops were forced to withdraw south by the River Seine, which bisected the German forces. This movement took them into the forested area of the frontlines. The British were able to move forward without difficulty and attack at the Marne River Bridge, which the German front line was still holding onto. The German troops at the bridge fought desperately to keep the bridge intact. But the British were able to push forward and capture the bridge in the early hours of the 9th.[1]At that moment, German General Erich von Manstein had pushed west beyond the Marne River Line and across the Meuse River, which formed the western half of the Western Front on the Western Front. At least 300,000 Allied troops fell under Manstein's pressure and were being subjected to vicious counterattacks by the Wehrmacht. However, these attacks were met with considerable local resistance from German troops along the way. The German general was eventually able to regain momentum and he crossed the Marne River at Saint-Maurice-du-Parciers and headed into the heart of Belgium. He advanced rapidly and captured Antwerp, thus opening the way for his troops to continue on beyond Antwerp into Holland. By the time he entered the Netherlands at the end of the month, German units had reached the Belgian border by the Marne River and were threatening to cross the Rhine River as well.British troops on the Allied's northern and western flanks had made no progress in preventing Manstein's assault into France. With the advance of Manstein's German Army into positions overlooking Antwerp, the Allies were facing a severe problem. If they were to hold on to Antwerp for long, they needed to reinforce their positions at the southern end of the Allied line along the coast. This would have required more than 2,500 men to guard the northern end of the Allied lines; without such reinforcements, the defenders of the German right flank were likely to soon be cut off, giving Manstein and German troops on the Western Front the chance to make an open attack on the British lines.[1]The battle EditThe Battle of the Somme was a relatively small scale affair, with the Allied Forces attempting to hold on to their positions in the Western Front. The first major battle of the Battle of the Somme, the Battle of the
By: Dr. William SearsA very recent statement in the news media is claiming that America's national debt will reach $20 trillion or more within the next six months. In other words, this number has been put on the front page of every morning newspaper and every broadcast of every television news program! So why do these headlines contain such a great deal of error? If such huge sums of money were actually being spent for a long time by the United States government, we can expect to see an increased number of unemployment claims, inflation, and even a "crisis!" This is what the media has been telling us all along, because of course it is impossible to print out an honest-to-God dollar bill anymore, because the government can't print money to pay for its debts. If you think back to 2007 and early 2008, during the height of the financial crisis, you can see that for every dollar that this country borrowed from the banks for "investment", the U.S. government received between 25 and 50 cents in interest. Since we are receiving so much interest, then the "official" (i.e., the government's) deficit is larger than it otherwise would be, as well as the deficit in "general funds". So far this year, the debt-service ratio was running at an annual rate of 9.6 percent. With interest and such a massive deficit, how can the federal government keep adding to the budget deficit? This is because the "national debt" is nothing but a paper title, and it is the U.S. Treasury that does the actual running of the national "debt" system.The Treasury operates only by collecting taxes and fees from the American people. They purchase bonds or bills which they print out or purchase from the government. Most people are unaware of the Federal Reserve System, which is a privately owned central banking corporation in New York, the United States. The Treasury takes these funds and lends them out to the central banking banks in New York which then create dollars and give them to the U.S. Treasury to distribute. It is the total volume of dollars in circulation that is the subject of the federal government "debt." However, the federal government doesn't even print its own money. It has been replaced with the printing press and the bank (or central banking bank) which prints the dollars for it. As a result, the U.S. Treasury can have more dollars than it actually wants, which means it can pay less interest. So, why is the Federal Reserve System printing up more and more notes and bills without the federal government ever actually paying off its debt? It doesn't. The money printed by the Federal Reserve is simply used by the various Wall Street banks, which in turn loan them out, and then pay the Treasury to borrow from there as well. This means that there is a massive inflation, as the amount of money printed grows astronomically. As the money is used up, the Federal Reserve simply adds more on, and then prints more notes and dollars. This entire system of money creation and exchange is based on the concept of fiat money with no fixed value like gold or silver. In fact, this entire economic system has been hijacked by a government that is now spending over 100 percent of its income on the military and is accumulating a record amount of debt. For the record, I believe that there should be an end to all government debt once a balanced budget has been achieved, because with no way to pay down debt, the economy will implode and unemployment will skyrocket. But this is a discussion for another time.In response to these huge amounts of debt, the Federal Reserve created a number of policies to increase "liquidity" and "stabilization" of the U.S. financial system. These policies have made the economy even worse, and since the Federal Reserve System also controls the dollar, our economic troubles are now even worse. For example, the Federal Reserve has increased the rate at which banks give out loans, and also has reduced interest rates to near zero. These policies have basically done everything possible to increase "liquidity" and keep interest rates low because of the amount of debt that will have to be incurred by the government during the next several years. The Federal Reserve's chief economist, Alan Greenspan, told the Senate Banking Committee that a dollar of increased "liquidity" translates into a dollar of additional interest income for the Federal Reserve Banks. That means that you have less money to spend in the economy, so prices, wages, and real estate will decrease, and unemployment rates will also likely go up! The federal government already owes a record $19.8 trillion in debt, and the Federal Reserve recently announced that it has $20 trillion of reserves that it can create on a "rolling basis" at 0.25 percent (in other words, at no interest) at any time. When the reserve currency, the dollars in circulation, is reduced, the prices and wages in the economy may not be as low as they would otherwise be
In a recent article on the U-Kelp-News blog on October 21, 2013, Tom McClelland makes a comment that seems to be a "must follow" quote from an "authoritative source":"The U-Kelp website is a bit mysterious. I did a search and did not find references to the authors of the paper in the references. I did find a reference to some kind of 'discovery" of the paper in a footnote to one of the sources.So, that's it. Just one paragraph saying nothing about a scientific publication that had been found by a peer reviewed journal. The author of the paper, Dr. Peter Lang, was not even a coauthor of this paper when he published it.Now, for a paper that had nothing to do with him, he's a celebrity in the field of paleoanthropology and paleoentomology. There is a Wikipedia page for Dr. Lang and a bio on the U-Kelp website:In his bio on the U-Kelp website, Lang states, "In addition to his role at the Laboratory for Evolutionary Biology, Peter studies the genetic history and diversity of Homo sapiens." The reference page was also updated that same day to say "Dr. Peter Lang was Senior Scientist at the American Museum of Natural History, where his research focused on the origins, evolution and phylogenetic relationships of humans in Africa." A subsequent Wikipedia entry, in November, 2013, also says that Dr. Lang was a senior scientist at the museum.I did a search of the U-Kelp website for any references to Dr. Lang and, alas, I did not find the references to the paper, nor the authors, nor the date of publication.So, who was the "authorized author" of this paper?So, who was the "authorized author" of this paper? The American Museum of Physical Anthropology (AMPA) (formerly the American Museum of Natural History)?No. The American Academy of Physical Anthropology (AAPA)?No. The Physical Anthropology Department at the University of Wisconsin, Madison?No. The Department of Anthropology at the University of Wisconsin, Madison?No. The paper was written and submitted for publication in 2010 by Dr. Tom McClelland, at the University of Wisconsin–Madison.(As noted above, he also wrote the paper in collaboration with Dr. David Lordkipanidze (U-Pilusa) from Kazan State University and Dr. Eilat Mazar of the Institute for Archeology at Tel-Aviv University in Israel.)But then, there is no AAPA, nor is there anything on Wikipedia about the authors of this paper being AAPA.There is no connection to the University of Wisconsin whatsoever. Dr. McClelland is not affiliated with the University of Wisconsin. And there is no reference to any journal publishing this paper.However, we can make our own connection between McClelland's work and the University of Wisconsin, as a few key papers he published on his website appear to have been published by the University of Wisconsin!So, what is our answer? Why don't we find references to these articles in the references given by McClelland? Is the only link in McClelland's references the AAPA, and the only connection to the journal being the American Museum of Natural History? Is there some other connection between McClelland's publications as listed on his website and his work as a scientist?I'm quite sure there's a link between these articles and the Wisconsin Institute of Cellular Medicine/University of Wisconsin, Madison, Institute. There might also be a connection through the U-Kelp/AMPA/McClelland connections. But there is no way, for me, to actually prove that there is. It really depends on how you look at it.There are some people I respect who have a "discovery" of this paper that I think is an excellent, exciting read, but it should really be cited by peer-reviewed journals: it is not in Science or The New York Times. The paper is not cited anywhere. There is no website where you can see any online citations for Dr. Lang's publication.So, that is the story. That's why I have some reservations about the work Dr. McClelland has done.Referenceshttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2434/9/6/7017http://www.livescience.com/5898-human-evolution-human-ancestors.htmlhttp://paleop.museum.umich.edu/hominoid.cfmhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davison_Dawkins
Puerto Ricans are asking their congresspeople on Thursday to support an economic aid package for their island that could run into a $70 billion ceiling.This means Congress will not be able to pass a debt ceiling deal until July.Puerto Rico asked Congress to pass a package in late March, but they have yet to take action.It has become the poster child for the federal government's troubled response time when dealing with emergencies and disasters in the mainland U.S., including in Puerto Rico.The federal government's slow response to disasters there is a huge factor in the ongoing debt ceiling crisis after Congress and President Obama failed to reach a deal for months.
For the longest time, I lived in the country and I missed my favorite breakfast foods. And then I got a home delivery from Kwik Stop and that was my breakfast fix ever since.A bit of a cheat, and I was not that excited about it… But hey, it was the next best thing. I was always happy that this morning I got my favourite ingredients delivered to me in convenient boxes.And what a box it was! So pretty!So this is where I got my inspiration for these delicious little cupcakes. The cupcakes I made for breakfast at breakfast on a Friday (my favorite breakfast of course) are the same cupcakes which I used here. I am still a little bitter that I have to pay more for the box which I love the look and the smell of. But I love the cupcakes just as much and if I had less room in my fridge, I would be ordering a box every morning.In fact, I order two boxes every day because I love the cupcakes.Since I have not been making cupcakes for a while, I don't have as many recipes as I could wish for. I have not been making cupcakes in many years. What I had when I was younger was my grandmother's homemade cupcakes, which I thought were great but I did not feel like making them more recently.Last July, I made a bit of an experiment. I used my favorite cupcake recipes from the KetoDietApp but I kept some of them. And here the recipe is:Vanilla Butter Cupcakes1/3 cup almond flour, sifted1 1/4 cup Swerve. It is not Swerve, I just didn't need more of that now, but I used Swerve because it was available from the store and it was what my blender spit out.1/4 tsp baking soda2 tbsp cocoa powder1/2 tsp baking powder1 cup cocoa powder2 tbsp butter (melted)1/3 cup sugar1/2 tsp vanilla extract1/2 stick of butter. 1/2 cup for the frosting.1/2 cup milk of choice1 8 oz box cream cheese, softened1/2 cup butter, softened.1 tsp vanilla extract1/2 tsp almond extractIn a mixing bowl, sift together the flour and sugar. Add melted butter and melted coconut oil and beat together until a smooth dough. Add the cocoa powder, baking powder and vanilla and mix together. Add all the other cupcake ingredients. I was very happy with how these came out, although in my opinion they are not as well made as my grandmother's cupcakes. I still think they are much better than those I had as a kid, but even at that I do not use the coconut oil I used then because I think I would not be able to keep it in the fridge.Now add the milk, butter and vanilla. With a spoonful, fold in the whipped cream and fold in to the dough like a little pancake batter.Divide the dough into three parts. If you prefer, frost half of the dough with about 2 tsp of frosting and place on a cupcake pan and then frost the other half.Bake for about 23 minutes or until you can flip them easily.I made my little cupcakes two weeks ago. I made them as I did the frosting. The frosting was more of a frosting but it worked very well with the cupcakes. They look cute, taste great and are super moist without being greasy. A really great snack for those mornings or a way to snack to help your body burn fat.The chocolate frosting is also really delicious for breakfast on a Friday. I hope you enjoy!The frosting can easily be kept at room temperature but for a creamier frosting I suggest rewarming it in the microwave.I am not sure if you can just use vanilla or if you need to add some almond extract. It was super easy to add both. I will also let you know if these are easier to frost when you try them.Please do leave your feedback below if you try this recipe.

A former top aide to President Barack Obama pleaded guilty yesterday to leaking classified information and is expected to be sentenced to five years in prison after a plea deal.John Brennan, 53, a career foreign policy adviser, pleaded guilty to two counts of unauthorized retention and unauthorized disclosure of national defense information after admitting that he improperly stored top secret communications and email from senior Obama administration officials on his personal computer.The Obama administration announced the plea deal Monday in a statement, saying, "John Brennan's actions were wrong and he realizes that. He is paying a very heavy price for his actions.""His actions were reckless and illegal and, combined with his failure to safeguard classified national defense information appropriately and his deliberate attempt to cover his tracks to avoid detection, reflect unfitness for office," the statement read."The charges were only the first of several steps the government is taking to hold people accountable," said White House spokesman Josh Earnest."A total of seven people who have been charged have accepted plea deals, and we expect others to do so as well," Earnest said. "There will be more to come."According to prosecutors, Brennan, who has worked in the White House Office of National Intelligence for nearly two decades, stored and stored classified information on unauthorized and private computers throughout 2011 and 2012 that revealed many of the most sensitive matters from the national security apparatus of the U.S. government."This is not a case that a single individual could have made without other people knowing," Assistant Attorney General Leslie Caldwell said at a news conference in New York. "There was a significant breakdown in information technology at the time."The Justice Department is still looking into the exact number of people involved, but the charges in the plea deal could include former National Security Adviser Tom Donilon and then-White House advisor Samantha Power.Brennan is accused of storing classified information on several computers, including his own personal computer."It appears Brennan may have been working on the personal computer of former White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough when he conducted the operation to search for classified information," Caldwell said."It is not clear why Brennan's personal computer was assigned to Donilon, but there seems to be some explanation. In fact, one of the documents recovered from Brennan's computer was an email from [then-National Security Adviser] John Brennan to McDonough advising the two former officials to work together 'for this issue on this specific issue.'""Brennan further appears to have had knowledge that certain classified emails were located on Donilon's computer," Caldwell continued. "Brennan further appears to have knowledge of the process for marking classified information in accordance with Executive Order 13526."In June, FBI Director James Comey asked Congress for an additional $3 million to help investigate classified leak investigations. The Department of Justice also requested $1.5 million from the Department of State to investigate the handling of classified and top secret documents after the White House's Office of the Inspector General found "systemic deficiencies related to safeguarding highly classified information in U.S. Government computers.""The national security of the United States requires that all government information be protected to ensure its preservation and safeguarding for the protection of our citizens and their national security interests," the DOJ release read. "Federal law authorizes the Department of Justice to investigate and prosecute individuals who violate federal law by making unauthorized disclosures; taking or receiving unauthorized classified information, or who use or possess information without authority to do so."Brennan's plea of guilty to both counts carries a possible two-year minimum sentence."As we said in April, our goal should be to send a very loud and clear message – and to put people on notice – that our security agencies take espionage seriously and they will hold people accountable when they violate the law," said Caldwell.In May, an unnamed national security official claimed that the NSA may have lost "as many as 100 percent" of the classified information it possessed before the former NSA contractor Edward Snowden released documents pertaining to the agency's activities to NBC. One NSA official, identified as "a former senior intelligence official," claimed that the NSA did not have the ability to keep the information it possessed from leaking.
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's top court said on Monday it reserved judgment on whether parliament had acted illegally by repealing a ban on abortions in Britain but refused to stop a new trial from going ahead.An anti-abortion campaigner holds a banner reading "Protect the unborn" during a protest outside Westminster Magistrates Court, in London January 3, 2013. REUTERS/Luke MacGregorIn 2008, doctors were legally able to perform abortions in Britain but restrictions imposed in 1998 meant women could only obtain them in specialist hospitals or via Internet sites.The law was changed in England and Wales in late-2013 to allow women and doctors and their terminations to be carried out at home.But a group of doctors accused of carrying out home abortions and an undercover reporter claiming to be carrying out a similar practice were barred from continuing with the trials earlier this year, in a step which campaigners say infringes on civil liberties.The government then told a court to set a new date for a full hearing which was due to take place on Thursday.In a ruling on the government's application for an urgent review of the ruling, the Supreme Court said the government had not breached domestic or international law by refusing to allow the abortions to take place.However, the court said both the government and a district judge had failed to prove the cases were important. It said it would not overturn its previous ruling, which it said had been made in the public interest.The government is now hoping the judges will consider whether they failed to show the cases were significant by considering alternative facts or by hearing evidence outside the court."The Supreme Court has granted the government time to consider whether the case was of sufficient importance to warrant an urgent review," a government spokesman said. "The Government would also strongly urge the courts to exercise their jurisdiction in the manner it would like to see applied in other future cases."The government's appeal was supported by a senior judge who said the government's case had been dismissed before the judge had fully understood the government's case and the issues involved.The government's lead barrister, Timothy Gee, said this left the judges with a strong suspicion there was a political reason why Parliament voted to allow the government to intervene.He argued the court was correct to hold the case before the new law came into effect rather than after it was enacted because Parliament had been given a chance to alter it. It rejected the government's argument.SOME IN JURISDICTIONThe court was split 4-4 in allowing this case to move ahead. Chief Justice David Lord and the judge who wrote the judgment, Lord Thomas, were opposed to allowing the new trials.Lord Thomas had said the government had acted lawfully when it chose to stop the two cases going ahead because there could not be a presumption that the cases were important enough to warrant a full hearing.The court's ruling did not refer to why Lord Thomas and Lord Thomas, in separate judgments, decided the cases were not important enough.However, lawyers for the doctor and the abortion provider are not surprised by the court's ruling."You cannot hold Parliament to be an irresponsible authority for the law in England and Wales (with respect to abortion)," said solicitor Michael Mansfield QC at a legal aid hearing.Mansfield said his clients had done nothing wrong but their case was only going ahead because of what he called "overreaching", with judges taking the government to court about cases which were not important.Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas said the decision meant people could be held by Parliament to be in contempt of parliament if they made statements about judicial proceedings.He said he expected "more and more cases" in which judges would intervene to stop the legal fight going ahead as people were accused of contempt for trying to publicise hearings.He suggested judges were being asked to "police the streets" because they felt the courts were too hard on lawyers."Our system of law in England and Wales has become more and more dependent upon litigation. To say that the Courts have become like the police in a way is a very disturbing description," he told the High Court in London.He warned that "a free press that promotes the legal arguments that prevail in one case are in danger of bringing down our system of law."Pro-choice campaigners believe any attempt to prevent the new abortions from going ahead could be challenged on the grounds of their unlawful restriction or discrimination.
I'd like it if somebody could clarify what "dude, that's just my face" means. I've been asked how it works, where it comes from, et cetera.It really seems to be a matter of the eye, eye, eye, etc..The basic idea is that we have some number of different eyes.To start out with, we might pick an eye that is in the center. This eye would be a basic point, and any other eye would get its own points, based on distance from this basic eye.This would take place for all humanoids.We then pick another eye. It'll have some kind of range of motion. For instance, the hand might have a wrist movement and a elbow move to keep it from moving in exactly the same direction.The next eye, we'd find that it can move to some fixed degree in the direction of the new point. The first and second eyes would be limited by the basic eye (which can move pretty far). The third and all other eye would have the same kind of motion that the basic eye has (if it moves at all).The first and third eyes then get their own basic range of motion by getting closer or farther from the basic eye. For instance, the hand would be restricted because it's pretty far away. The second and second and third eyes would then be limited by the first two, etc..The range of motion is a measure of how much farther a particular eye can move relative to the last point of the eye list.If we take some other humanoids as a reference point, that would have a different range of motion for each eye, and they would also all be limited by the basic eye. If we'd made a few eyes, and then we threw in another species, say a giraffe, we could have a very different range of motion.If we want to say that some body part/eye has this particular range of motion, we have to say it's a function of the eye. If it has 100 eyes and 100 eyes have 100 degrees of range of motion, that would be a 100th eye, which is 0, and that would not have it's own point.I was wondering if anybody felt that was the actual function of a certain number of eyes relative to each other.
When he's not playing his accordion, Michael W. Taft writes about food. His work has appeared in a number of publications, such as the Journal of the American Association of Pastry Cooks, and he is executive chef of the restaurant, Bar & Kitchen at the Four Seasons, in Los Angeles. He is a former director of pastry at the University of Virginia, and also served as director of pastry studies for the U.S. Army's Culinary Weapons School. Michael is also an accomplished author. His latest book is Tart Tart: A History of the Fruit, Its Cultures, and the Art of Food Prep. He lives in Los Angeles with his family. Follow him on Facebook, and read what he has to say on Twitter (@mike_taft) and Instagram (@mike_taft).For those of you in Europe and North America only, there are lots of opportunities to do some real pastry making in the summer months around the Mediterranean. As a result of a long-term project on which he was a consultant, I'm thrilled to be able to tell you about my favorite bakery, La Belle Epoque.La Belle Epoque (French for The Beauty of Everything) is a small bakery in Saint Malo, France, with six lovely shops. I've been to the shop in Gisors on the east side of Saint Malo at least twice, and also several stores in Nantes, the oldest city on the coast in Normandy.My French is not good (but I have improved as I've gotten older), but I've had a few opportunities since moving to the United States to get to know locals better, and get to talk about their favorite places at home. After a visit to La Belle Epoque, I was thrilled to share their best places with you.There are several great reasons to go to La Belle Epoque. The main one is that they make a variety of excellent products such as pastries, confections, and cake, with a focus on quality and authenticity. Each shop offers the unique experience of cooking for yourself. The shops also have a very well-curated selection. La Belle Epoque is known for the exceptional pastry. The pastries, such as the lemon tart, are not only superb individually, but they taste great together with the other products. The lemon and cinnamon tart, for example, are very nice together with the almond sponge cake.The shop also offers a wide variety of cake: cupcakes, muffins, and more. This is one of the best places in Europe for cupcakes, and it gets more frequent use than you'd expect. The pastry and cake aren't limited to desserts. If it's a bakery, they'll make a pie.The cake is made with a variety of ingredients. La Belle Epoque specializes not only in vanilla- and chocolate-filled cakes but chocolate truffles, sponge cakes, and some of the most spectacular chocolate almond truffles I've ever tasted.The baker also makes individual cakes that are available for purchase. I've bought the chocolate almond cake, the lemon chocolate, the sponge cake, the cinnamon cookie, a couple of their pastries and, of course, the cupcakes.Since the shop is located in a small plaza, you can park in either its parking lot or in the nearby village's parking lot.What to choose? Chocolate or vanilla. The chocolate almond cakes are good. The sponge cake and cinnamon cookie cakes are fantastic, too. There's a good selection of vanilla or chocolate scones, which is a perfect base for all sorts of chocolate cakes, like the raspberry chocolate, the raspberry chocolate, the chocolate scone, and also the gingerbread.Also, try their chocolate cake, made with the chocolate and lemon fillings. The lemon filling tastes much more like lemon meringue pie than lemon cream, but the icing that goes over the top is incredible. I don't know how the lemon filling tasted in Spain, but it's delicious here. I can see why people buy it. In fact, you'll find people here buying only lemon meringue in the shop.Finally, a note about how much you can buy on your visit. On most days, they offer two kinds of pastries, cakes, and cakes and cream with cream. A dozen pastries at the bakery costs €3.50. The price for everything else is between €2.50 to €4.50, depending on your group and the size of your group. But the shop doesn't make very large groups so that won't be a concern.As you can see, La Belle Epoque is a great place in France, too, if you're willing to pay attention to quality and quality of ingredients in their products.Where to buy La Belle Epoque products? I've been buying the sponge cake the best for my family from La Belle Ep
It is our sincere hope that you will come to love the world that exists around you. Our aim is to help you see in the world of games the wonderful creatures, people and locations that live therein. This website is not merely a collection of screenshots of video game titles and we have no intention of becoming more than that - however, it is the sole job of a fan site to provide an environment where we can share with you the various aspects of the gaming and gaming related world around the world.- Our goal is to be as inclusive as humanly possible and thus we endeavor to make our articles as broad and thorough as possible.- To help us in our endeavor, we offer some help from time to time. If you would like to help us do more with the site, please write to us about any problems, problems with content, or problems with your experience. You can do this here, or send your request directly to our admin.- Most importantly, you can always send your comments here, here, here, etc....Thank you and enjoy the world that can be brought to life in the worlds out there!A few days ago we had the pleasure of going to a local game store. We were looking at most of the new and upcoming titles which they had for sale. One title was The Elder Scrolls 6, I would like to share a snippet from a couple paragraphs here, because it was one of the most fascinating.What did they ask us to do? They asked us to write a few sentences about The Elder Scrolls 6 and what made it different from Skyrim, because they felt that there was something special going on. So we wrote this:There were more questions to be answered but they were all easy to answer, right? Wrong. They wanted more information so they asked us to spend an hour or two with the game and write an article about it. We could feel that they felt that we would do our job for them somehow if we did just that, because after we finished writing our article we were asked if we would write one more, and if we did that we would be thanked by them. We agreed and they got their article up as fast as possible.Now here's where it got interesting. On this article, they asked us to write about how we felt the game had improved on the previous installments, which in retrospect wasn't all that hard. After all, we were told that the game had gone through a significant improvement, and since we saw the improvements we were asked to write on that. Yet something more happened, and because it happened before we had finished writing our article the article was deemed "weasel friendly" and we were asked to remove it. This was done not because of the topic, it was done because this was the only article they had about the game which didn't seem to be "weasel friendly". So in short we were asked to remove our article because it was not "weasel friendly", and we have been asked by several users to remove our articles in the past for not being "weasel friendly".Now why would an article entitled "Weasel, weasel, weasel..." be deemed inappropriate in any way? Well to answer that you really have to go back a while, because most of the articles you see here would not be called "weasel friendly" if they mentioned anything positive about The Elder Scrolls 6. I think we can all agree that most of the positive articles you see with the game on it is because it has a solid and lengthy story line that is really worth talking about and exploring, and those articles are not the "weasel friendly" type of articles which we would see on this site.So if you want to write about the game then this is the site for you. We'd like you to learn about the world which you play and how you can enjoy the game, and since you cannot possibly finish the game all at once, hopefully this can help you gain some knowledge as an enthusiast about the game. There is a link to the FAQ linked there if you need more help, and if you can't read the article, let someone else find it for you. If the article needs to be removed for any reason, let us know, and we can remove it ourselves. We don't want to be asked to fix our article just to please the people that ask us to.Also note that this game is so large that you most likely can't read the entire article without scrolling a bit, even if you had a scroll bar, but maybe we can make it a bit easier. Let us know if you have any questions or if you would like something added!

It's one thing for conservatives to demand that the US government take strong action against climate change, it's another thing to demand that the government itself stop being involved in climate change science.That's basically what's happening now, according to a new letter from several prominent environmental organizations, written to top State Department employees.The groups — 350 Action, Greenpeace, the Sierra Club and the Natural Resources Defense Council, which has spearheaded a high profile lawsuit against the Obama administration, the Center for Biological Diversity and others — have sent a warning to top officials in the department asking them to tell their fellow State staffers that they're working on projects "to reduce your department's involvement in climate science."Climate change, they write, "will disproportionately harm communities of color and communities of faith." In fact, the letter goes on to say, the "climate justice movement" has become "the largest civil rights movement of our time — and the US government is directly complicit" in its cause."It is essential that all of us in our departments, agencies, bureaus, and offices realize that climate change is real and our actions must reflect this reality," the letter reads. "We ask that you urge your colleagues to publicly acknowledge the climate change threat to these communities, and to develop a climate justice program that advances climate change mitigation and adaptation programs."The letter is signed by more than two dozen civil society groups, including the NAACP, United Church of Christ and more. "We need your help now more than ever," the letter warns.
The U.S. Air Force and Lockheed Martin have been given the green light to develop a joint unmanned aerial system (UAS) program that will take the form of a hybrid, four-seat, light aircraft to act as a "force multiplier for troops on the ground," the Wall Street Journal reports. The UAS program is one part of the Pentagon's Global Hawk initiative, which would also equip soldiers and Marines with the new airborne reconnaissance, surveillance, targeting and reconnaissance capabilities. This is the military's first attempt to create a new form of armed drone, in line with the new laws passed by lawmakers that allowed the development of such aircraft. The WSJ, citing a statement from the General Services Administration, says the program is being overseen by a military task force in coordination with various departments and agencies.In addition to developing an "operational capability" for soldiers who might need the UAS, the program will also provide new opportunities for companies trying to develop the necessary technologies. Lockheed is also working on development of another kind of aircraft as an upgrade for its F-35 program, and will combine its airframe with that of Boeing. The WSJ says the program is in its earliest stages, with preliminary design work already completed. Lockheed is working on a prototype of the aircraft and its sensors, which are supposed to be ready by 2012.While the drone program won't be as fully developed by the time the WSJ reports, it would be in line with recent developments at Boeing, whose new Long Endurance Multi-Intelligence Vehicle (LEMV) is likely going to be the first fully unmanned vehicle capable of flying at high altitudes as part of the Air Force's drone program. LEMV will be the successor to the company's Phantom Ray, an aircraft used by military and intelligence agencies to collect intelligence over remote areas. But instead of relying on drones, LEMV is meant to be capable of flying to higher altitudes, where it can gather satellite imagery and other data.Image credit: Lockheed Martin
An online community is being set up to support the new film "Lincoln," which features a portrayal of Abraham Lincoln which is not flattering to the Republican and Democratic presidents, reports the Hollywood Reporter.The film, which hits theaters Dec. 16, has also sparked debate on whether a film with an anti-war message could be considered propaganda.The controversy stems from the portrayal of the first President of the United States as an unhinged, tyrannical maniac.Although Lincoln did have his detractors, the fact that a major studio and a major film have to censor the portrayal of Lincoln shows a lack of respect or understanding of this historic figure.The online community being created to support the film's release is called "Lincoln Was Right", and will include a number of sources from people with different opinions on Lincoln, as well as people opposing it."We are not a film organization," the website writes, "rather we take a variety of angles and opinions on our side and encourage the discussion and criticism about it. As with all good discussions, we want our opinions challenged and the contrary opinion shown for discussion. After all we are making a film and are supposed to represent the views of our director and star."Our intent is to allow fans to participate, not engage in a debate of a movie's merits."The site is also being run by three other individuals, all affiliated with the movie industry."When we found out that the film was being made by a prominent producer with a prominent and well funded Hollywood studio [and] that the movie was to be shot in the town in which Lincoln lived and wrote of] we all felt that we had an obligation to step in and show our displeasure with the choice of film material in the form of commentary from people who know Lincoln's life and times," read a statement included in the site.The site adds that the producers would be welcome to have them on as experts in any field, and encourages people to sign up to get updates about the project."Please note, this is no way at all meant to hurt this movie, we love the film industry and the people in it and that is not the issue," the site reads. "The issue is a lack of respect for this great American hero for which we would like the movie to be called, and we are doing this as a way to put that issue on the table so that our minds and that of others are informed!"Lincoln is currently in post-production following a multi-million dollar budget that included $60 million being spent on a Lincoln biopic, much of it being spent on casting. The film begins with a fictionalized, extended flashback to the life of the 26th U.S. president, including his life at Warrenton, Virginia, as a child.A scene showing Lincoln, now an experienced veteran, standing over and taking a musket ball off a fellow man is cut for theatrical reasons.In the beginning of the flashback, however, Lincoln is shown, as a boy, playing a game of "chicken with a dead dog" with a friend.One of the boys on the team, William Herndon, is said to have been a Republican. Later in the film, Herndon is depicted as a Confederate sympathizer; this is never depicted to make Lincoln into an anti-semitic, warmongering dictator.The story also never shows Lincoln being given a military command by the statesman and statesman's son, John Hay, the governor of Virginia at the time, for war.And, of course, the film never shows Lincoln raising his right hand to be sworn in as president in his first inaugural address, as many believe, leading many to believe the "war hero" is a liar and a tyrant.Lincoln did, however, do plenty of despicable things, including supporting slavery.He also made an insane amount of enemies, starting at the end of the Civil War because he believed the Union Army was fighting for the North rather than the South. Many, however, felt he only did so because of his hatred for his own party; others, such as Abraham Lincoln himself, believed Lincoln was a flawed leader who served the interests of the powerful and could not be trusted to speak for the disenfranchised masses."That movie Lincoln, I think, really is a film that's trying to present the president that they want. I mean, this is the film that's being made for people who want to see Abraham Lincoln. That's what's going to happen," Lincoln Film Company president Richard Lee told Fox News, in reference to the film's depiction of the first President Lincoln.
Facing a federal lawsuit accusing him of running a prostitution ring out of his Washington, D.C., apartment, a former Democratic House of Representatives staffer said Tuesday he has done more than a million interviews over the past 13 months in a bid to clear his name.Cpl. Anthony Buzuvis, 27, who worked in the House and then as chief of staff to a House committee investigating President George W. Bush for terrorism-related activity, will appear in court on Thursday in an attempt to avoid a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that could strip him of his pension, which was reinstated after he was convicted.Buzuvis, who was convicted in December of taking tens of thousands of dollars in bribes from undercover FBI agents, said he has paid back the money but that he is innocent in the lawsuit that his attorney, James Blatt, filed earlier in the week in U.S. District Court.Buzuvis was working in 2004 as a spokesman for the House Government Operations Committee. Blatt said he was trying to help a congressional investigative committee review the Bush administration's post-9/11 terrorist-related activities and "build public confidence that its activities were not part of a larger agenda, but instead a response to emergencies on that day."The committee's investigation found no evidence that Buzuvis or two other employees of his company, G2 Investigations, took bribes or paid agents for information about suspected terrorism suspects, Blatt said.His attorney cited more than 3,800 interviews by Buzuvis with federal investigators and prosecutors, the FBI, several other agencies and news media, in making his case."He spent his entire career as a public servant in the United States, serving the American people," Blatt said.According to the federal lawsuit, Buzuvis and his co-defendant, Matthew Daulton, used G2 Investigations to arrange hundreds of thousands of dollars in payments to a single undercover FBI agent, claiming the money was to be spent on "international assistance and services."Buzuvis was convicted of accepting more than $120,000 in bribes from undercover agents, money that he used for business purposes on trips such as shopping trips or a vacation to Italy.Buzuvis, a native of the Philippines, did not respond to a request for comment sent Tuesday.Daulton, 32, was convicted of receiving more than $1.6 million in bribes from other individuals and for taking nearly $10,000 of that money for himself. Federal District Court Judge David C. Orrick revoked Buzuvis's pension this December after Buzuvis spent 17 months behind bars.Daulton, who is a U.S. Postal Service employee, has not been charged with any crimes.Blatt is seeking to have the ruling tossed out in an effort to have Buzuvis's pension reinstated, and the lawsuit said he's willing to testify before Congress.Buzuvis is scheduled to appear in federal court on Thursday for arraignment before a magistrate judge.
Karen Pence, wife of Vice President Mike Pence, left to right, daughter Charlotte, father John and son Carter in Washington. (Alex Wong/Getty Images)The Trump administration will allow Indiana-based Carrier to keep more than 800 jobs from moving to Mexico, a top aide who worked on the deal said Friday, amid criticism and opposition from the White House.The Indiana governor's office, said the company is retaining about 1,000 jobs through the first year of a planned $16 million investment and will pay roughly $7 million in state tax breaks starting in 2021.Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross on Friday confirmed the agreement but said "no one had to give up their jobs.""We'll continue to hold companies accountable if they don't keep jobs in this country," he said.Carrier's parent company, United Technologies, is a top defense contractor and is owned by billionaire chief executive Gregory Hayes.Ross said that United Technologies received the tax breaks for "good faith" and not retaliation for the fact that the company had decided to retain jobs in Indiana."United Technologies is going to get those tax incentives regardless, and it was a very difficult contract negotiations for them," Ross said. "They have not been threatened with losing jobs."Carrier, a heating, ventilation, and air conditioning company, announced in February that it would lay off 1,300 jobs and ship the workers to Mexico.A day after the announcement, Trump took to Twitter at his New Jersey golf club to criticize the move. "We will not allow America to be taken advantage of any longer. That is why our government will no longer allow companies to leave our country on a temporary basis without consequence," he tweeted.We will not allow America to be taken advantage of any longer. That is why our government will no longer allow companies to leave our country on a temporary basis without consequence. Thank you — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 29, 2017Trump's tweet came one day after he took office by promising to put "American workers first." Critics, citing the Indiana deal as an example of such a shift, say the president is taking cheap shots at the companies — including an Indiana-based Carrier executive and a top Trump aide, Steven Mnuchin.The companies reached a deal to keep 800 of the manufacturing jobs that the company planned to close in Huntington, Ind., the site of its operations.The deal was based on the assumption that the company would receive incentives under North America Free Trade Agreement, although the deal stipulates that the incentives could be withheld if an incentive program under the agreement was altered, according to a copy of the deal obtained by POLITICO.But United Technologies declined to discuss the tax incentive, citing the discussions.Trump has blamed Democrats for the Carrier deal as well as for other manufacturing job losses at American plants. When an Indianapolis manufacturing plant was closing before the election, Trump blamed Democratic Mayor Joe Hogsett — who is now on the board of the parent company's parent company — for keeping the job in town, not Carrier.During a Tuesday visit to the Carrier plant, Trump said his administration is "not going to let them leave, period.""This was a great deal for the people of Indiana, great deal for the people and for companies and for the military. This was something that they wanted," he said.The Carrier deal was in accordance with a deal with the state of Indiana, according to spokeswoman Elissa Slotnick, since she said the state was "very sensitive" to the fact that the plant "was not going to move to Mexico regardless as to how many incentives they ultimately received."
A Florida woman was arrested this week for stealing the car of a man who helped save her baby, according to the Gainesville Sun.The woman, identified as 20-year-old Stephanie L. Johnson, was accused of stealing the car in the area of Lake Wales Boulevard and SW 14th Street on Wednesday.Johnson did not have a Florida driver's license at the time police arrested her, and it was not clear why she was not able to obtain one.Johnson allegedly told a responding officer she had lost her license.Officers were able to identify her as a suspect through surveillance video, and she was arrested on Friday without incident.
DETROIT - Four years ago, the city closed the Detroit Public Library's branch library in Corktown for poor lending records, bad books and a lack of use by customers.This week, Detroit officially removed itself from the Library Services Board's list of city libraries. That means Detroit is technically a self-funded public library."I like the new library plan," says Mayor Mike Duggan. "It's a really smart approach and a great public-private partnership."The City of Detroit has not been a member of the Library Services Board since 1991. The new plan from Mayor Duggan removes some of that restriction."We've already received a commitment from the city to contribute a total of $12 million for our new library building," says Dr. Karen Smith, president and CEO of the Library Services Board. "We'll be partnering with the district and Wayne County (County Library System) to provide all the digital resources that people need to access their local libraries."The library building project was approved in 2006. The public will now be able to vote on the library plan.The Library Services Board also says the new library building will bring a new focus on community involvement."People are going to actually be able to see a library staff member in a lot of cases so it's a much more interactive experience," Dr. Smith says.The new plan is on pace to open in April. It was reviewed by the Detroit Planning Commission, Planning Commission, Detroit City Council and the Wayne County Commission in July.In addition to the library, the new Public Library for Detroit is expected to have 10 branch buildings, as well as the ability to provide free wifi.
When a woman starts to cry in the middle of a meal the restaurant staff and servers quickly start to look around, taking out their phones to record her. It seems like an act of compassion not a surveillance device as soon as one is introduced in the food setting. It's almost like the world are moving towards full-on monitoring of all our personal interactions. I always thought of this as a good thing until reading about one restaurant in Seattle that decided instead to have multiple cameras on each table, all of which will start filming at the sound of a certain phone being used…not so much a surveillance device as a privacy and freedom nightmare.The Seattle restaurant serves three basic meal deals. There's a $4 sandwich with a salad for $15, $5 wings with a drink for $15 and $12 steaks, a "sauce, salad and small sandwich" deal. All three include salad, a small salad, soup and an appetizer of choice, so as you can imagine if you had three pieces of salad and several sauces (soup, salad in particular) you're out way more than $15. They are also available as pre-sliced. The salad is served on a lettuce leaf wrapped in lettuce paper so people will definitely know what's in store for them.The restaurant owner tells CNN that the restaurant is a part of "Social Equity", which is one of those social business concept that I really don't get. Social justice? Not so much. I can see the benefits to having a menu that is available to anyone and anyone can buy them. But, that's basically what the Social Equity concept is. It's social responsibility for corporations, not individual choice."These guys are paying an enormous amount of money to be with their families. And we can't have that money going to a restaurant that discriminates against people because they are disabled. We are not being paid enough to take our kids to a social enterprise," said owner Chris Miller."This is a really simple, common business practice today. It's nothing new.""These guys are paying an enormous amount of money to be with their families. And we can't have that money going to a restaurant that discriminates against people because they are disabled. We are not being paid enough to take our kids to a social enterprise," said owner Chris Miller.According to CNN this is not a new thing at all. The owners and staff of the restaurant were in the restaurant business for a while and had heard plenty of stories about other establishments that would not want to have an open and free business because they felt that they needed to be "politically correct".I can definitely see the business benefits. Not only are you serving three different meals for $15 for a whole family, but also the restaurant gets to make a lot of money off the appetizers which are more likely to be watched. Plus, this may make the staff more comfortable knowing that not everyone is a "bad guy" when dining at the establishment. Even though it may not be a perfect solution, it may be for the time being.There will be a full report from CNN on this in the not too distant future. The owner of the restaurant told CNN that it's not only the families paying for the service that's the issue, but also the waiters who are taking orders to help out the families. He felt that the families being asked for the services are "very poor" people that didn't deserve to have the restaurant make anything off of them. However, as anyone who's ever worked in a restaurant know that's not going to be so easy to explain to the whole restaurant.
"Duke Nukem, the world's most famous, best known and beloved (of course) video game character, has had an illustrious career and was often the center of controversy. In the early 70s his career took such a turn for the worse that one might call it an 'End of Time' for the character."On June 15, 1979, on a television program in which Duke Nukem is a guest, Nukem's father is shown playing the game 'Mech Warrior 3', as Duke Nukem had at 5 years of age. On the screen, Duke's father is seen firing an arrow for one hit points (or 'hit points' as they were called then, since then they have become 'hits' and are now called 'health points' or 'HPs'). After this, 'Mech Warrior 3' is over and Duke Nukem, who seems to be under 10 years old, is seen standing there holding his father's arms as his father says, "Oh, my poor little Duke!""I was sitting in my home watching this episode and when I heard the name 'Duke Nukem' I had a moment of inspiration. Just the name had a certain ring to it and of course that was exactly the kind of name I was looking for for my own character and the name 'Nukem' fit the bill perfectly."Since Nukem is a military leader, you'd think he'd be a hard ass as he's been called, yet his character seems almost too kind, almost like he's the opposite in the sense that he has a soft, loving aura to him. What is your process for creating such a believable character? How do you go about conveying that kind of warm, compassionate attitude? I'm thinking of the character of Jabba the Crabs from Return of the Jedi as the most obvious example.A few years ago I had a chance to meet the creator of Jabba the Crabs, George Lucas. I asked him, "How did you come up with the character of Jabba the Crabs?" He said, "Well for one thing he was in the movie and he was a huge success. And for another, he's the worst character in the whole thing, the most awful character I've ever seen in any film, ever. And that got my head spinning and I couldn't put that to rest. So I said I'm going to do something about it." After a few months he had a script called 'Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back". He gave me the assignment of writing him for that particular film. At the time I didn't realize that it was going to be the first movie in the entire Star Wars series. The first one was Episode IV: A New Hope. And George had a whole bunch of problems, because he was shooting Star Wars at the same time as he was making Empire Strikes Back. So he had to find new characters for him to play on behalf of Lucas.The first person I hired to write him was none other than Donald Fagen, the voice of Obi-Wan Kenobi. I said, "Well, I know I can trust him, he's an artist. We just want him to go for it. We're not trying to change his voice. I'm just going to let him go for it." Once he heard Fagen's voice for an instant, a connection was instantaneous within our minds. It was so good, in fact, that we decided to do the other characters that George wanted to include in the movie, and when Donald didn't get those parts we were very disappointed. And because we hadn't been given to say what Donald is interested in doing and where Donald sees his artistic potential, and George saw Donald's talent, he just wanted to know where Donald stood in his heart and how they could possibly be compatible. After some discussions, Donald decided to leave the film. The next day his agent sent a handwritten note to the director saying, "Donald doesn't see where he can possibly fit into this movie. The only thing I'm allowed to say is Fagen is the only actor who can do what you want. Now Donald has to leave the film, and if you don't like it, you can tell him he sucks and you're letting him go." The next day the director wrote back in a very terse way, saying, "That's it!" I'm really pleased to say now, two years later, here we are with 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' and it hasn't been that hard to reconcile the story to who 'Duke Nukem' is. It really has been a matter of giving Donald the freedom to go for it. We've already got the first two scenes in the movie set up to the best of his ability, and once Donald is ready to step into all those characters, we don't need to write anything for him. He's already got the part."This is very exciting to
The number of people using the app in the country has increased by 13.7 percent this year, according to the latest data."The number of users in China is increasing year-by-year.

What the media doesn't want you to knowLet's start with what you have to look forward to. No more news headlines  'Rotten-to-Excess' Fruits (Mugwump and Red-tape) to return; 'The Big Show' in the Middle Ring - but the Undercard will be filled with the very best! The undercard is packed full of exciting action, but there will be two matches in a row with the likes of Taya and Shaven Joe on either side. The UK will be treated to a new style of wrestling, a style that will shock the wits out of the world. This is something that not even WWE knew that they had, although most have tried to copy them to no avail for a variety of reasons - most importantly because there is no style that matches WWE's. These are my predictions, so please leave them in the comments as usual, but let me know what you think would be the best match up.In the ring: John Cena Vs Mark HenryThis match was made for two things - for WWE fans to see the two face off and to make John Cena look good! The thing with this match is that both men will be the aggressors, trying to be the champion, while in the other corner you will see Mark Henry showing his great in-ring skills and a great physique with his long hair and muscles, and John Cena trying to be the ultimate cool guy, like they say on the new WWE website. This match will feature high action shots and will see John Cena take a few punches from Mark Henry, while also having a few other matches on his mind - mainly getting out of this match he is expected to get by beating Mark Henry - which will only increase his anger with The British Bulldog. In the back of my mind, I hope Mark Henry can win as it will be amazing, but you will have a real hard time watching this one with the possibility of John Cena being injured and needing to be replaced. John Cena has a lot of great matches coming up before his match with Mark Henry, which is sure to be fantastic.Other matches of noteRey Vs Brock Lesnar I do not think any Wrestlemania match can match this match - and the way that it will play out will only get better over time, and this is what makes this a big fight. Rey is still one of the most feared women in the WWE, and I have no doubt in my mind that this match will not be easy for her.In the ring: Daniel Bryan Vs Randy OrtonAnother match I believe John Cena can beat - although it sounds strange, I believe Bryan will come out on top over Randy Orton, but the thing is I think the finish will be good for Bryan, who will have won this match on his own terms. Daniel Bryan was a one-of-a-kind Superstar in the WWE up until he was fired from Raw in 2013 - there is just no doubt in my mind this match will be a good one. In the back of my mind, I hope Roman Reigns will win as he's one of the best wrestlers in the WWE and would deserve more than the defeat he is currently getting - I understand that it's his job to be in the main event of every PPV and that's what he gets paid for, but this will be a long time from now. Other matches of noteRandy Orton Vs John Cena – I did not predict this bout before, but I think they will both win and you will not go crazy trying out the other.Seth Rollins Vs Roman Reigns  - This match is going to have a lot going on in it from both sides making it a different kind of match, and will be as thrilling for the WWE fans as it may be for you - both those expecting it and those wanting to see this feud continue.In the ring: John Cena Vs AJ LeeOne of the match-ups that most of WWE fans want the first match as it would be an absolute classic, with one of the most powerful and charismatic Superstars and a beautiful, natural beauty, with one of the best personalities in the entire industry, and both wanting to establish themselves on top. This could be the most amazing thing ever - the first woman to win that world titles and it is not a dream, this is the real deal that is only happening because she is good enough. John Cena will have to be extremely careful and not give them a chance to hurt her in the ring, which will be good for her because John Cena will be the best referee in the WWE. In the back of my mind, I hope that AJ Lee breaks her leg in this first one, because I will never understand why she stays in the wrestling business - maybe someone in WWE doesn't feel she has enough to give them

The following blog post, unless otherwise noted, was written by a member of Gamasutra's community.The thoughts and opinions expressed are those of the writer and not Gamasutra or its parent company.I've been a part of indie dev communities around the world with an eclectic amount of experiences, but my experiences have consistently been very good. It's how people learn. They're willing to ask questions, listen to my opinions and learn. It's how I see players as allies.When it comes to the indie gaming scene (or the indie publishing space in general, I should say - I write for indie devs - my job is to give the industry's best advice to game developers), I'm always asked the same question. The question that's been on my mind for over a decade is something like, "What does it take to get people to listen to you?" What do the many indie dev blogs, forum posts and podcasts that I've read and watched get me? What's wrong with them?I was asked that question a few months ago during an interview I did with a fellow developer who is well known in the indie game development community online. His name is Nick Robalik and on the day he and I were talking about the indie communities, he mentioned to me "I feel like every time I'm at a big game design event, I've seen a lot of really good games. The problem is, there's one or two games I've talked about all day but they never get noticed by the press," which is a common sentiment from indie devs I hear. That's a problem, I agree. The media has a lot of problems today (the most glaring of which is their failure to cover gaming media in a critical and respectful fashion) and a lot of these same problems seem to affect indie devs as well. I'd say that as much as half of us, if not more, seem to get this question asked a lot on the blog and podcast front. That's really the only way we can possibly make it to the press without being shut down outright.So when it comes to the "What should indie devs talk about in the press" question, I say don't try to have the press write about you. That's silly, because the press talks about indie devs and you should talk to them about what you do, not how much you suck or how you make games. The point, as I see it, is that you should talk about the things your audience cares about. Talk about your games, talk about how you make them. Tell them the stories, let them see who you are and make people want to be friends with you.For those of us who feel like we could be good game developers if only the press took us seriously, that's a great place to start. So why am I writing here about my experiences with the press and our various interactions with them? Because I've gotten the message from a lot of indies - not just indie devs themselves, but from indies in general - that they're sick of getting ignored, that no one is listening to us anymore. That's a problem in and of itself for indies, because there's no denying that it's getting harder and harder to make games these days.Indie dev audiences are getting smaller and smaller and smaller as new indies arrive and we begin to look down upon one another. I'll speak to what I've seen and experienced firsthand before going any further:The press likes to call us "new," but the fact is that I'm not really an "indie" anymore, or at least I wasn't for a long time. I'm one of many, maybe a smaller minority, of indies who are trying to make their way in this huge industry and making meaningful impact in it. But in order to do that, you need a way to connect with the wider audience you've reached, and if there's one thing the indie community doesn't seem to do very well, it's connect with the wider audience.We're all too excited to speak and share and speak our opinions and share our stories and get things right before the press even asks - that's the "old" way of doing things. But while we'll get that right before the press, the truth is that you can't get it wrong, and we, the indies, are going to fail. It's really not hard to find our self-imposed shortcomings, and we should be embarrassed that we don't keep them to ourselves, but when asked, no one wants to hear it.Now, I don't know about you, but for me, it wasn't all that long ago that I thought it was. That's when I realized that I am one part of the problem and one part of the solution. I'm part of the problem because I don't think indie games are relevant enough to be discussed. I think indie games are cool, but I don't think
In an era of social media and endless gossip, it would be a tall order for anyone to be able to predict the outcome of an NFL game. But for fans of the Atlanta Falcons, it means a second straight Super Bowl championship.The first-place Seahawks beat the Falcons in thrilling fashion in the NFC Championship game, 23-14 on a beautiful Hail Mary from Matt Bryant. But a second straight NFC title for the team has the Falcons in the Super Bowl for the second consecutive season. They have won two Super Bowls in a row, giving them a better winning percentage than the Pittsburgh Steelers or Tennessee Titans for the fifth straight year.For Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan, a second Super Bowl in the past three years is special."It just means a little bit more," Ryan said. "It's one of those things in life where if you try to get too hyped about it, you get a little bit too excited. We know the importance of the team. We know what it means. Everyone knows the significance of a win. It's kind of a cool bonus just to get to play in the Super Bowl. It's something we're used to."Ryan had two games in the lead and one last chance to get his team to the big game. In Seattle, the Seahawks defense took over and stopped Ryan and the Falcons in their tracks. The Atlanta offense, which had the league's best defense before the postseason, was put in a three-and-out. Ryan threw an interception, threw a ball to an easy return in the end zone and hit his receivers. He threw another interception, got to the one-yard-line near the end zone and tossed a pass that was intercepted by Malcolm Butler. Ryan's desperation final drive fell short. The Falcons had three chances to win.What happens after the Super Bowl:Falcons coach Mike Smith, who has a great reputation throughout the league for his preparation and preparation of his team, doesn't have a problem with the game being decided on the final drive."If it gets out of hand, we're going to be all over it and we'll see about it," Smith said. "But if the right calls come, we've got to be ready to win it."In Seattle, the Falcons will have the best defense in the history in the NFL and the best offense in the history of the NFL, but it was the defense on Saturday that made the difference.In his final week as Falcons head coach, Mike Smith had Matt Ryan and Mike Nolan on the field at the same time in their two playoff wins. One of the keys to the victory was the defense, and that will be no problem again in Super Bowl 51 in Houston."I've felt really good over the past few weeks," Ryan said. "I think this team just needs the opportunity to have a big-time season. You've got to have a big-time offseason. You've got to have some tough guys that can step up. We have a lot of guys that can do it. I think this team can have something special."Ryan also praised the offense for being so dangerous against the Seahawks because of the way they were able to attack from their two best offensive players in Bryant and Julio Jones. However, it was the defensive stand that kept the Seahawks offense on the sideline long enough for the defense to take over the game and make it hard on Russell Wilson."We have a great defense," Ryan said. "That's why we're in the Super Bowl. This offense is so good. I don't know that we've had a team that was that good and we haven't been able to put a defense on the field."If there is a problem for the team in Houston, it's that the defense can't stop anyone, even the pass rush and run game."They got Matt Ryan and they got Julio Jones, which is an unbelievable guy," Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman said. "We tried to match their skill set. That's my job. I don't know about any of these other guys. Our job is to get out there and tackle him. Those are the two most dangerous guys in the league."What will have the greatest impact is the defense having to carry this team throughout the Super Bowl. The Seahawks defense is still one of the best in NFL history. But what makes it great? In their last championship season back in 2009, the Seahawks defense, led by Sherman, won the NFL Defensive Player of the Year award. They also held Peyton Manning out of the playoffs for three straight years.
MADRID — The last time Alexis Sanchez visited the Spanish capital, it seemed to be his dream. The Arsenal star was just 19, had just won the FA Youth Cup with the club, and had signed a five-year contract.In a city that prides itself on its love of the underdog, the Gunners teenager became the face of the club for many. He had arrived with the hopes of winning the first UEFA Champions League title for the club in 26 years, or finally breaking its 10-year Premier League winning drought.Now, however, his future is less clear. A hamstring injury sustained in January has forced Sanchez to sit out an extended period and, to the surprise of many, Wenger has suggested that the Spaniard could leave this summer.Speaking at his press conference on Thursday, the Frenchman admitted that Sanchez is in the "final stages" of a move to Real Madrid. The Gunners are in talks with the Bernabeu club over a deal worth in excess of £70 million and Wenger would not be drawn on his client's future during his press conference.Arsenal has not revealed whether it is now willing to release a buy-back clause on Sanchez's contract to move in the other direction or whether it still stands by its insistence that the fee that it agreed with Juventus in the summer of 2015 is the correct price to pay for the forward, with its own finances in the red."He was very focused on the Champions League. He loves the competition, wants to be part of it. Now he has a serious injury which is affecting him," a club source told the Daily Star on Thursday."He is in the stages where he needs treatment and hopefully this will be over and that we can get some clarity."If Sanchez's future has changed, so too has his approach to the game; now, rather than being defined by the past — with Arsenal failing to win an FA Youth Cup since 2003, or the FA Cup since 2004 and ending the trophy drought in 2005 — he is increasingly defined by what he can achieve now and the prospects that still exist next season."I know that I am an important part of the club's future, but this is not an issue for me," said Sanchez, who has just turned 21. "I continue working hard to give my best every single day," he continued, adding that he would be more than happy to remain at Arsenal until his contract expires in 2018.
PURPOSE:This study evaluated the effect of a single dose of the recombinant human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (EGFR-2), combined with intralesional recombinant human epidermal growth factor (rhEGF) on both basal and induced cell proliferation in vitro.METHODS:In this clinical trial, 25 healthy volunteers received rEGFR-2 (15 mg/kg) and rhEGF (50 mg/kg) 30 min before an intraoperative laser excisional photoblasting procedure. The number of induced and basal epidermal keratinocytes (ECLs) was examined as the baseline, then after 4 and 12 weeks, followed by an analysis of basal and rhEGF-induced epidermal ECL proliferation.RESULTS:During the 4-week study, both treatments significantly reduced basal epidermal ECL proliferation (F-test, P<0.05) and significantly increased basal rhEGF-induced proliferation (F-test, P<0.001). By 24 weeks, rhEGF administration significantly reduced both basal and induced epidermal ECL proliferations, while rEGFR-2 treatment did not.CONCLUSION:Rheumatoid arthritis patients may consider rheumabagem infusion of rhEGFR-2 in the treatment of active inflammatory disease.
DETROIT - The Detroit Red Wings announced today that the club has named Tom Wilson assistant coach for the 2018-19 season. Wilson also serves as an assistant coach for Hockey East's Vermont Catamounts. In addition, Detroit has named Ryan Martin his new assistant coach after he was granted an opportunity to become a full-time employee of the Red Wings."Ryan is one heckuva coach, and it is exciting to have his assistance in all aspects of the game. He has had a tremendous career so far, but he is not done creating success with these young men and women who play for him at the collegiate level," said Red Wings General Manager Ken Holland. "Not only did we look for the right guy for this position, but we also wanted one who could help us in the development of our young players at the AHL level, as well as the NHL level. Ryan has done a terrific job with the Catamounts in a lot of ways, so we are excited to work with him."Wilson has spent the past 16 seasons at the helm of Vermont, including his last eight seasons as head coach. The Catamounts played their 16th consecutive season in the nation's top collegiate division which is the longest active streak in the nation. Vermont captured a pair of CCHA regular season titles in 2013 and 2014, and are five wins away from capturing the conference championship in each of the past three years. Wilson guided the Catamounts to an 11-1-0-1-0 season in 2017-18, and ranked in the top-10 nationally in both goals-against average (2.28) and save percentage (.931).Martin, 33, joined Michigan this season after serving six seasons (2001-12) as the head coach of the U.S. under-17 team. He led the Americans to an 11-0-0 record at the 2015 IIHF U17 IIHF World Junior Championship, a silver medal at the 2016 IIHF Women's World Under-18 Championship, and a gold medal at the 2017 IIHF U17 World Hockey Challenge.Over the course of his coaching career, Martin has compiled a record of 312-116-43. His five coaches' medals - including four golds - as head coach of the men's national team have led the United States to five IIHF World Junior Championship and two world championships. Michigan won the program's 10th NCAA title in 2016, was the first NCAA program to ever win a national title in men's hockey, and won its 12th NCAA title in 2013.The Red Wings return to camp after the team held an optional practice Monday at Joe Louis Arena. The team is next in action Oct. 25 when the Detroit Red Wings visit the Toronto Maple Leafs. 2018-19 Red Wings training camp roster:Forwards
The "Lucky Seven" show's original creator, Lee Hyun Suk, recently stated that he can't believe the success of the series, due to the fact that he thought many fans would not like a drama aimed at children.He made these comments while discussing the recent success of the "Goblin," a program about a young boy who finds a magic bracelet and begins a journey."I thought it would be a bit difficult for a variety show, but that's been my mistake," Lee Hyun Suk said during a recent broadcast of his talk show "My Love from the Star.""I thought that many viewers were not a mature age. I didn't think the variety show's target audience was so young… They must have really like it."He also claimed that many viewers are immature and said, "I don't know how old these people are, but I think they're a mature age since they're watching this… They're a large population."Meanwhile, fans are already speculating which actor, and actor team, Lee Hyun Suk will cast for its fourth installment. A character named Han Seo Joon is set to appear in the show by default.Source (1)

You may ask why the FBI has taken more than 1,000 pages (1,300, including appendices) to decide what information should be kept secret regarding the controversial Russian dossier paid for by the Clinton campaign, but the agency released a report on the matter on a Friday evening.According to The Wall Street Journal, the FBI's internal memo on the dossier is dated July 21, 2016, and it was initially supposed to be classified prior to publication, but the FBI requested that it be kept secret.The memo includes a brief description of the dossier compiled by former British intelligence agent Christopher Steele. It was obtained by CNN shortly after it was published in full by BuzzFeed News on Jan. 10.The document makes clear that the FBI initially suspected Trump campaign staff was colluding with Russian officials to win the election, but ultimately decided the dossier was too unreliable to publicize. According to the memo, a number of Trump associates were being investigated during the summer 2016 in connection with the dossier, but none of those involved was the subject of the FBI's interest.The FBI determined in the memo, and the report, that while the allegations in the dossier were concerning enough to warrant a briefing in the lead-up to the inauguration, Trump himself did not think they qualified as blackmail material.At the time, Trump had publicly criticized the contents of the document on several occasions.In October 2016, Trump tweeted about how "fake news" the dossier was that suggested he was tied to the Kremlin. Trump also called the dossier a "phony Russian Dossier," and "Russia just said the unverified report paid for by political opponents is 'A COMPLETE AND TOTAL FABRICATION, UTTER NONSENSE.'"But the memo notes that the FBI believed that despite that, it would be irresponsible to share the entire dossier with the rest of the country, particularly in a media atmosphere where Trump was widely assumed to be a Russian puppet.The report then goes about providing a timeline of the various allegations in the dossier.The document outlines specific parts of the dossier that the FBI believed were particularly problematic, including assertions that a British spy recruited by the FBI attempted to recruit Trump officials.The report states that while this was initially seen as a concern, the FBI "became concerned that the counterintelligence risk from this recruitment was moderate to high because (1) we did not have specific intelligence that such an effort had been made, and (2) the relative ease with which a US person with no Russian ties could be recruited would make it more difficult to determine the validity of the allegations."Further, the FBI believed the document also included other inaccurate statements that contributed to the impression of the dossier being unreliable.At this point, the FBI was having significant problems with the validity of some of the allegations.One allegation alleged that a "Male Uyghur" working in Prague offered "Male Uyghur female prostitutes" in the spring and summer of 2015 based on the fact that he was "interested in hiring female prostitutes," and said that two such prostitutes "were offered but refused by him," The Journal reported.A third allegation, that at least some unnamed Russian officials had been monitoring Trump Tower as part of an effort to "recruit" a Trump aide to serve as a representative for Russian President Vladimir Putin in the 2016 presidential election, required the FBI to take additional steps as a result.Again, the report noted that the FBI had concerns that the information in the dossier is "not reliable and may contain errors." Still, it found a "relevance" to the allegations and decided to keep the material under wraps, given the "high risk of embarrassing or compromising" the Trump administration.The FBI's decision ultimately backfired, as the documents were leaked before the official briefing with senior members of the Obama administration was even scheduled to take place.But with the FBI still grappling with why the dossier was published, the documents still provide insight on its origins. The Wall Street Journal confirmed that Steele was paid by the FBI and British intelligence agency GCHQ "to help investigate Donald Trump and his advisers."
In a world of mass-produced smartphones that are often more powerful than the ones they ship with, it's interesting to see something as uncommon as an Arduino device get mainstreamed by a company that has only created custom boards for itself. But that is exactly what Ouya did with its board, and with the help of this DIY build it's even more powerful, with higher capacity storage, a camera and WiFi capable. And if you're still doubting its utility, just give it a whirl: it's available now on Kickstarter.AdvertisementThis is what you get:An Arduino Leonardo board (with no power input or USB host)A micro USB charging connection (for quick recharging)Three buttons: "Play", "Record" and "Launch" (you need to plug in the camera and power input)An accelerometer (a.k.a. Barometer) and a gyroscope (aka Compass).Bluetooth to get you up and running quickly.The boards cost $49 to make, and that includes an Arduino for the base unit. The board is a little chunky and large compared to the other options, but it's surprisingly easy to set up. There's an SD card socket you can stick onto the board (if you choose to use the camera for recording), so if you make some adjustments to the code or design you'll be able to run the game without the need to plug in a charger, and you should definitely install the Wi-Fi chip.AdvertisementYou can easily add sensors for depth and movement with a bit of trial and error, as they're pretty simple to add. The accelerometer and gyroscope will let you play while walking and running, as well as in freefall, so your Ouya can be used as an alternative to a simulator for space exploration, which you can try in the video below.The best part of all is that it's incredibly easy to use, making it easy for even complete newbies to use their new Arduino as a controller. Even more, it only requires the bare minimum parts to be able to build a fully-functioning, full-featured, well-made, inexpensive video game console. That's what makes this Arduino Leonardo worth the $49 price tag.You can make your own build at Ouya's Github page, or head on over to Reddit to see the many other people that have taken the plunge.
"There's no doubt that it was not a good decision and there are some people at the company that do regret it and they've apologized to me and I've apologized to them. I think I've proven a lot to people that I'm a decent person and they're willing to forgive me but it was a poor decision that was made."The story of how the company is handling things is getting pretty convoluted and in the end, it's all about the words of its founders."At the end of the day they can say anything they want," says Kip Kollar.The CEO of Square has admitted that he was wrong for not getting more input from users about how their money was spent. Kip Kollar admits there was a time when the feedback was taken as a directive, but says he "learned a lot" about the marketplace and realized that customers were upset at how Square's services were being used. "What's important as an organization is making sure that we're listening," said Kip Kollar.As he tells it, things have changed drastically in the last year.We're still figuring out what is appropriate and what isn't appropriate to let go of personal feedback, we have many meetings throughout the day to try to identify what is appropriate feedback and what isn't appropriate feedback. But the first thing we try to do is to just understand how much it will cost and what benefits we can add and also try to understand how we can improve by listening to customers and our team members that are here at the company. As a result of that, I will tell you that we have made a lot of progress in terms of how we're building our business, how we're communicating to our customers, how we have more and more conversations about it with our team members as well as through our community.That's what Kip Kollar was told by one of his senior executives, who was surprised by how much the CEO had grown on Square over the last year, after all, he told him he had no idea what Square could become, but he now knows what he is. It's "not a big company that's running in the background, but it's the one that's going to be running your life," said the team member.Even some of the executives have noticed a change in attitude on the Square team. "I think that he realizes that he's made a mistake." said one former executive who was not authorized to speak about the internal discussion for Square. Still, it's also a "good thing."According to him, the team now understands that "people are not a big priority" for Square and that "the company really needs to move on to do some real stuff when it comes to being a great place to invest."Kip Kollar was supposed to be part of a reorg that would be launched this month, but now he's not sure if that reorg is happening or not. For now everyone is trying to figure out what's next...
A woman is suing Donald Trump for not having paid her for work done on the Miss Universe Organization, according to the Associated Press.Summer Zervos, an aspiring model who appeared on The Apprentice in 2012, claims Trump sexually assaulted her when she was a contestant and worked on the set of the show.Trump, through a spokeswoman, denied all allegations made against him."Summer Zervos vehemently denies the allegations made regarding her by Apprentice Season 11 competitor and Mr. Trump," a Trump spokesperson said in a statement. "She is glad to see that Mr. Trump has resolved these issues with his campaign. At the same time, she has no intention of letting Mr. Trump or anyone else intimidate her into silence. Her record speaks for itself, and she looks forward to making her case in court."According to the AP, Trump's lawsuit claims that Zervos asked to meet with him about a job. At the meeting, he claims, she repeatedly brought up an affair she claims Trump had with a woman on the show, and he invited her to come to Manhattan to discuss a potential job.During a separate meeting at Trump Tower, Zervos alleges that he kissed her, but she pushed him away. As they stood, she says, he grabbed for her crotch, and she jumped into his lap. The AP calls this behavior a "sexual assault."Zervos, the AP says, told people in the room what happened, and she reached out to the media to speak out, including Politico in August. This week, Politico reported on the allegations made by another former Apprentice contestant, Mindy McGillivray. In a post on Medium, McGillivray also said Trump kissed her without permission during a business meeting at his Tower in Manhattan.The lawsuit alleges that Zervos first approached the Trump campaign in 2015 and sought a meeting with Trump. According to the AP, the Trump campaign told Zervos they would not be able to accommodate her, and she filed a lawsuit."It is shocking that someone with the stature of Trump could be accused of this horrendous behavior and still remain in office," her lawsuit states.[Trump's accusers share their stories in personal accounts of Donald Trump's abuse]Zervos's suit is a first step in the defamation process, which could require a court to make a factual finding or order a person to disclose things. She has also filed a motion with the court to depose all of Trump's witnesses in the case.In the wake of Trump's comments on the sexual assault accusations made by women who said he had assaulted them, Zervos was not the first person to accuse Trump of sexual assault.Jessica Leeds, 74, told the New York Times that Trump had grabbed her breasts and tried to turn her around to face him when they walked on a flight more than 30 years ago.In recent weeks, more allegations have emerged about the kind of misconduct that women allege Trump has committed.In a 2004 Access Hollywood video, then-Access Hollywood host Billy Bush mimicked engaging in sex with a woman and made crude remarks about his intentions.In a 2005 deposition, Trump bragged that as a celebrity, he could "do anything" to women.Trump's denial of the women's allegations has led some journalists to question their credibility as journalists. The Washington Post reported that the women who have accused Trump said they had done "little, if anything, to merit Trump's denials."After a recent Washington Post report detailed the allegations made against Trump by a number of women, some of which have not been previously reported, Trump's campaign issued a statement denying the allegations and saying the report was designed not to focus on the candidate but on the claims of the past.A number of Republican leaders have called on Trump to step down as the presidential race nears its final presidential debates. On Monday, Republican National Committee Chair Reince Priebus said that Trump needs to change his behavior."Every women must be heard: #MeToo. To all the women who are silent, silenced is not an option," Priebus said in a tweet Monday.Every women must be heard: #MeToo. To all the women who are silent, silenced is not an option. — Reince Priebus (@Reince) October 13, 2016
What you need to know about the 'Jobs-must-be-done'-Obama tax credit is actually about saving jobs: A report by the Obama administration in 2011 predicted that the tax credit would be worth $14 billion that year. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)A tax credit for employers who hire qualified workers has proven to be a big winner for the Obama administration. The federal incentive to pay an early retirement or buy a new plant, for example, is valued today at a little more than $12 billion with $7 billion of it going to businesses that hire Americans. The tax credit is now valued at roughly $18 billion, up from $10 billion in 2008.The federal job training programs are also expected to receive $6 billion in tax credits in 2012.President Obama's jobs bills for 2009 and 2010 provided more than $1 trillion in tax credits that are going to corporations, small businesses and individuals and businesses for payroll costs, capital expenses, research and development, and salaries. These credits have enabled firms to make investment projects and to hire workers without raising the tax burden.The tax credits are a big part of Obama's overall effort that he said in a 2009 speech to business leaders he'll "show the world we can create millions of good jobs from factories and plants to factories and data centers by investing in our future." But, he said, "This is not just about creating a few hundred jobs; it's about creating millions of good-paying jobs."How much can be received? The federal government doesn't release a breakdown on how many of the credits it awards have been applied and how many have not.The Obama administration did disclose in February of last year the total dollar amount of each of the various tax credits that were awarded in 2009. They totaled $74 billion as reported in the government's "Annual Report to Congress on Business Tax Expenditures," or ACTA. The number of credits awarded went from more than $10 billion in 2008 to $9 billion in 2009 and $9.67 billion in 2010. In 2009, only $1.3 billion of the $74 billion total was in income taxes — meaning a total of $18.3 billion went to businesses — or a 17% increase.In 2010, the final total for the credits was $9.67 billion and the number of businesses receiving them was up 10% from 2009 to $11.25 billion. In 2009, only 39% were small businesses and only 564 of this $12 billion in 2012 credits went to smaller businesses. The $6.3 million value of the 2012 credits went to 3.1% of businesses, or nearly $100 million, which is less than what is being awarded in those grants.Why did the federal government become so generous with its tax credits to businesses?One reason is to address the growing economic disparity in the country. Since the 2008 financial crisis, as companies have shed jobs and employees, small businesses have struggled to pay more money for services and goods they create without making up for the cost of their employees, said Bob Scott, president of the North Carolina Small Business Chamber of Commerce."We can understand the economic challenges [larger firms] face but that shouldn't be a reason to punish the small business community," Scott said. "They need this type of help as well."The other reason is that the federal government wants businesses to help provide for an aging population. At the same time, some businesses have said hiring workers in an aging population is important for their survival in the long run.What are the rules, limitations or restrictions for the companies that win these benefits?While the exact amount of credits depends on the size of the business, employers are generally eligible for the credits if they hire at least 200 Americans during an eight-week period and if at least half of the workers are hired within 50 miles of a manufacturing facility. If a company hires Americans at any other location, the maximum number of credits they can win can be reduced by five.These credits are generally distributed among businesses of varying size but the administration tries to give every business a shot at the credit, whether it is large or small.What is the process for applying for these credits?The federal government does not release how many applications receive tax credits or when and where applicants apply. The government says the application can be made online. For that reason, it is not uncommon for applications to be incomplete. Small businesses may say a job-training program didn't happen or that the workers did not work in a place called 'training center' in the application. The government uses it discretion if to turn down the plan. The application also has to answer "Does this plan benefit jobs or increase the number of jobs?"The federal government also states it is voluntary and that businesses can choose not to participate in these tax credits. However, businesses that do choose to participate cannot receive another benefit for two years
DALLAS – A transgender woman was arrested Monday, July 17th in the northwest Dallas area for allegedly threatening to shoot up a middle school. The woman, who also goes by the name "Chelsea Rose" (pictured below) had allegedly made an announcement on twitter that she was going to kill at least five children at Lone Star Middle School while they were inside the gym gymnasium.According to the Daily Mail, in a telephone interview Tuesday, Sgt. Lisa Cogdell with the Dallas Police Department said the incident was not believed to be connected to the shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., that left 20 children and six educators dead."In this particular situation, what this teen was thinking and what caused her to want to cause harm to children she didn't know was something of importance," she said.According to KDFW, the 13-year-old girl, who was not publicly identified by the Dallas Police Department. She had reportedly threatened violence against her school and her own classmates. Police also responded to her home in the 900 block of West Pecan Street, where she was reportedly wearing a "man's body suit."Following her arrest, the girl was reportedly interviewed by multiple law enforcement agencies, with only one saying that she believed her story.Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com.
This article is from the archive of our partner .The "Hollywood Ten," a group that included actresses Jean Arthur, Ginger Rogers and Grace Kelly, won a Supreme Court fight in 1979 to claim damages over a movie titled Pretty Woman that they said "stole" their names. Now, the movie's maker, Robert Evans, has agreed to pay them the $12.5 million they were seeking that would be split between them and the others who were involved with the film.The Hollywood Ten got their $12.5 million from a law suit (in which the plaintiffs claim that Evans used a fictional actress and a "character" named Jean Arthur) that was brought over a "stripper song" that is now credited to the women. Evans was sued under the Federal Copyright Act by the "pretty woman" plaintiffs and the "songwriter," who are all credited as Joan Jett. Evans countersued, and the Supreme Court agreed to hear a case involving whether the defendants violated copyright by using the fictional women's vocals as they claimed. (In fact, "Baby Got Back" does include a reference to "the Hollywood Ten.") The Court determined that the defendants "knowingly used" the fictional Joan Jett's voice in the song, which then infringed on the "Jett" copyright. The women sued Evans, and the Supreme Court found that Evans knew what he was doing when he used the fictional Jett voice in the movie.Evans' settlement with the Hollywood Ten was revealed in a court document, and he will receive $7.1 million for his work on the "Pretty Woman" movie. That will include his expenses from the movie's release, including making appearances (not just in the title) all over the country, including in a Broadway play, at least one high-profile commercial, and another in the form of "Preliminary Jury Instruction" form the Court handed out to the Hollywood Ten.
"The U.S. is losing its monopoly in the global economy. If it doesn't start being more flexible and pragmatic, it will lose itself."—Juan Garzón, Former Mexican Minister of TradeIn the year 2000, a group of economists, business people, and government officials assembled in Washington, DC, to formulate the world's "New Imperatives" for economic growth on the basis of the following principles:1. The ability of firms in the United States to produce goods and services at the world average wage is what determines whether or not they will remain in operation domestically. It is the only indicator of a firm's ability to remain economically viable in the United States.2. Since U.S. firms are now producing goods and services at a world average wage, it must be the case that a U.S. firm can become profitable anywhere, and in any market, in any country. But there must be some limit beyond which that ability will be lost—such as by raising prices. Thus, a low U.S. nominal wage is no guarantee of a high level of domestic employment for foreign workers and firms.3. In order to maintain the world's largest market for exports to the United States, the United States must reduce its export tariffs to a level in which the average cost of imported consumer goods and services is at parity with those of domestically purchased U.S. exports.4. The goal of reducing U.S. trade barriers should be to eliminate or significantly reduce barriers to U.S. exports to all countries of the world.These imperatives, in order of importance, have been stated many times in recent years in a variety of policy documents by the International Trade Commission, the U.S. Department of Commerce, and the Joint Committee on Taxation (on page 30). For example, in 2001, President George W. Bush, at the invitation of the Joint Economic Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives and U.S. Senate, issued a report, "The US-Japan-China Economic Partnership," as follows:The United States and Japan have entered into a partnership on trade and investment to advance mutual economic growth and prosperity through expanded trade, investment and labor market opportunities. These mutually beneficial partnerships will help to promote the growth of U.S. and Japanese manufacturing jobs.These principles are now embodied in laws that have been enacted in the United States and many other countries with respect to trade policy. In 2004, President Bush signed an agreement (GATT 2003) governing the international trade of automobiles and motor vehicles between the European Union and Japan. GATT 2003 includes a minimum agreement standard of 50 percent participation of Japanese automakers (excluding small and medium-sized enterprises) in the European market. These trade agreements thus ensure that the "New Imperatives" are fulfilled more fully.However, the GATT 2003 standard has recently become challenged on several grounds. First, a series of anti-dumping lawsuits was launched by Ford Motor Company (in its individual capacity), General Motors Company, and Chrysler Corporation (in their individual capacities). The suits allege that certain U.S. and Japanese car and light truck manufacturers have been benefiting from artificially high import duties and other trade barriers imposed by the United States and Japan, and that these barriers have led to severe declines in the sale price of vehicles with many Japanese-style features. Second, there is a complaint that a series of U.S. anti-dumping and countervailing duty cases, and other domestic policies, threaten U.S. exporters to Japan by artificially increasing import competition for U.S. car and light truck manufacturers. Finally, there is a complaint that the GATT 2003 minimum tariff commitments are, in the words of one complaint, "too generous to U.S. car and light truck manufacturers."I first became interested in this topic in 1988, when Congress enacted the Trade Act of 1988, which has since become the basis for U.S. domestic trade policy. The Act was the culmination of the negotiations at that year's GATT round in Geneva that produced the "New Imperatives". It imposed a 12 percent tariff on Japanese motorcycles imported into the United States, except under special conditions, as of March 1, 1992, and as well as a 17.5 percent tariff on imported automobiles. The Act also included the largest export duties ever imposed on any country by the United States.At the time, I was a staff economist at the U.S. Department of Commerce, where my research interests included industrial and trade relations. I then worked for the House Ways and Means Committee (which oversees the U.S. International Trade Commission), the Committee on International Trade and the Senate Finance Committee (which oversees the International Trade Commission). With Senator Bill Roth and Senator Edward Kennedy, we co-authored the landmark Trade Act of 1990, which greatly expanded U.S. trade liberalization in the early 1990's.Since 2002, as part of
A number of people have approached New York State Senator Daniel Squadron (D-Tompkins County), offering to fund his campaign for the open New York senate seat when John Flanagan retires, reports the New York Daily News.Squadron recently visited the Capitol where he told the Daily News his staff have been inundated with messages, emails, and phone calls. Squadron is hoping to have at least four donors step forward to contribute the amount of $500 or so to fund Squadron's run to win the seat in 2016 in New York."I have got about 100 contacts in this district," Squadron, a Democrat, told the Daily News. "I am a great candidate who really stands for an agenda."However, although Squadron says he is a good candidate, he also says he wants to get more involved in local politics, which is why Squadron is pushing to get more of his constituents involved in the campaign for his Senate seat."I want to do things that the people of this district have not done in the years since I have been in office," Squadron said. "It's time and it's time again it's time for New York. I want to use the time I have as governor to get involved in local things that New Yorkers are interested in, that New Yorkers support."
A man who shot dead a former colleague who he'd falsely accused of the crime had been in a long battle with mental health issues, a court has heard.Jason George died with a knife to the throat two days after a police raid at his home in Brisbane's northern suburbs, on January 23, 2016.The 42-year-old had previously suffered a brain injury a number of years earlier, and suffered from bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.At the time of the incident police were led to believe Mr George had "a long history of mental health issues", Queensland's Director of Public Prosecutions, Michael Gannon SC, said outside court on Tuesday.At the time, Mr Gannon was defending George, who was charged with the killing of his former colleague David Pritchard, who was shot at the home in Para Vale about 3.15pm that day.The pair had worked together for nearly two years, including during the 12-month time period where Mr Pritchard was killed.

The "N-word" and other offensive terms were spoken by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump at Florida rally.He also made reference to the Islamic State (IS) terrorist group as a "crazy motherfucker" in reference to the man with the Islamic State flag who stabbed people at the Orlando LGBT nightclub."This isn't about you or Hillary Clinton. It's about you and your job. Are you crazy?" said Trump at one point.The Republican presidential front-runner also spoke about the issue of illegal immigration, saying that he had been "right" about the whole issue from day one. He also repeated his claim that President Obama did not know about the terrorists attack beforehand, though Obama later said he was briefed on the shooting last month.His remarks about the Orlando shooting came a day after Trump criticized President Obama for not calling the victims of the shooting by IS terrorists "radical jihadists"."If you look at the President Obama, at the press conferences and the speeches, the worst day would be on TV, if you want to know the truth," Trump said. "And it's the same thing with this gentleman with the stupid hair, the terrible glasses."Trump referred to the man as Seddique Mateen, which means something like "leader of the faithful."When questioned about this remark by CNN's Wolf Blitzer, a Trump spokesman said on Wednesday his statements were "tongue-in-cheek" and had in fact referred to Mateen as a "very fine man."Read moreTrump's comment about the Orlando shooter comes days after he told Fox Business that Obama should resign immediately following the Orlando killings."As far as what's going on. If President Obama was going to be commenting about something, why didn't he do it after San Bernardino? You know what happened," Trump said in a segment aired on Tuesday. "We should have been much tougher," he added."I don't think Obama should have said anything when he got elected," Trump added, noting that it would have been better to have spoken up after the San Bernardino shooting that left 14 dead.Also Wednesday, Republican Senator Joni Ernst, a candidate for U.S. Senate in Iowa, called Trump's remarks "totally inappropriate" and said that the Republican presidential frontrunner had "crossed the line.""I hope he retracts them, or apologize for them," the senator said on CNBC. "My hope would be, you know, that people just understand that it's inappropriate for someone to make those kind of hateful remarks."Ernst is a member of the U.S. House of Representatives and is currently in a close fight with Senator Chuck Grassley for the seat vacated by retiring Republican Senator Tom Harkin.The Trump campaign did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
After a five-year trial, a jury finally decided Wednesday that J.M. Smucker did, indeed, commit mail fraud.The jury, which deliberated for an hour and a half at the Franklin County Courthouse, found that the company's former regional bottler and one of its largest private-labelers did, indeed, knowingly misrepresent to consumers that the products they sold did not contain artificial coloring or flavors.Prosecutors on Wednesday said the company would pay back $742 million to consumers and businesses around the country, plus restitution for consumers who were defrauded."The jury's verdict sends an important message to the public that companies like J.M. Smucker must play by the same rules as every other American enterprise," United States Attorney Josh Minkler said in a statement. "We are grateful that the jury found that J.M. Smucker misled consumers into thinking their sweetened and flavored beverages did not contain artificial colors and flavors."J.M. Smucker said in a statement that it fully expected the verdict will lead to "considerable liability" for a company "that has a long history of strong ethical stewardship.""We are now considering the next steps to avoid the loss of even more innocent victims and look forward to being heard in our ongoing appeals process," the company said.Smucker, which produces a number of snack-sized products, including Nutella, is the last of its four main bottling companies to face criminal charges for allegedly mislabeling products that were sold under its own corporate brands.Prosecutors alleged that Smucker made false claims about the nutritional value of its products during a three-year period in 2010 and 2011. When consumers bought the beverages, federal prosecutors said, sales figures were padded based on a "manufacturing cost" of around $2, a figure that included labor costs. Smucker made the claims without telling consumers which products did or did not list the ingredients listed on the product label or packaging, the Justice Department complaint said.The case centered on products such as Jamba Juice. Smucker had accused the maker of the popular fruit-juice drink of being "the largest producer of artificial sweeteners in the world."Prosecutors alleged that Smucker misled consumers about the amount of sugar, high fructose corn syrup and other ingredients in the drink, while also making similar claims about its other products in similar sizes, such as Cacao, Sugar Free, Vanilla and Jamba.The company's defense lawyers told jurors that the "misleading representations are harmless" and that the company is "not guilty of fraud.""Our products are produced in an incredibly clean, safe environment, and we are proud of that," an attorney for Smucker, William P. Johnson, told jurors on Wednesday. "We are the right people to make those products ... We are 100 percent confident in our products."Analyst John Pitzer of Evercore noted that the case was unusual because "they [consumers] feel the harm happened in 2010 and 2011 [while] the products were sold in 2011 and 2014." But he added that, based on other evidence, "It seems likely that they would have been aware of the marketing and advertising from the 1990s."If convicted — which would have put Smucker and other defendants in prison for a period of 25 years — Smucker would have faced fines and up to $10 million in civil damages.In its statement, Smucker said: "At all times, our goal has been to put our customers' needs first and we believe we have been successful. Our success should never be based off a few misstatements about our products. We have always sought and continue to seek the truth for our customers."
Kirby Smart is the first African American in FSU memory and, thus, the only African-American coach with a national championship at an American professional school in the past six years. A successful first year coaching for the Seminoles is a welcome addition to the program that hasn't seen much success in his 12 years as an assistant with the Atlanta Falcons.Sitting on the hot seat to be the new head football coach at Alabama, the first major public job that's open after the SEC Championship Game, Smart is a candidate to replace Nick Saban, a man who made Smart's career after the first assistant coach in the 2013 recruiting class landed with the Crimson Tide.Smart has been on the hot seat just three times: during the 2010 BCS championship season at Georgia, in 2011 at Georgia Tech and last year at Alabama. But that's all he has had so far, no national titles in his second stint as a head coach (2010-12 at Georgia Tech and 2012-13 at Florida) and no national championships by a Florida assistant coach as of today - Smart is the only one.So for the past six years we've seen the same type of coaches that have been hired in other years in Smart's previous stops – one year and one year with a title or two to hang their hat on, then a hiatus, then a one season break, then another break - a three year break between head coaching appearances. It's become commonplace to say that we've moved beyond that phase where coaches in SEC sports are expected to have a winning record, or consistently perform at a championship level. But it's the first time all four coaching staffs are represented.Last season we saw a lot of turnover among the assistants on the staff, but the first four-year break between a successful coaching staff since 2010 appears to be a common experience for new coaches on the road to winning titles with SEC football teams, a time where coaches with long tenures are often asked to take "time off", whether at their current job or elsewhere.We also've seen the emergence of new assistants - and the return of former assistants – on the staff, something that doesn't happen very often in the SEC and doesn't happen to college football assistants more often than not because of salaries – those salaries and benefits usually aren't worth it for coaches on staffs who aren't bringing in a championship. But that's not to say that coaches without championships shouldn't be given opportunities.When Kirby Smart takes over the Florida State football program after the 2014 season, he'll inherit one of the most talented rosters in the country, a team that was ranked 10th in points per game last year, and had an experienced coaching staff that includes a few former head coaches.But before he can move into that first win this fall, he has to start with the 2013 season. The program needs an answer for at least a few spots right away.Here are the nine most glaring issues with the 2014 Florida State football team heading into the season, from the point of view of the coaching staff:1. QB and RB are the most talented on offenseSince the passing game isn't fully functional without De'Andre Johnson , the quarterback position has been a big area of concern. The only other FSU quarterback to lead his team in rushing last season was Everett Golson, who had a mere 948 yards on the ground. In contrast, the only other top FSU running back after Johnson was James Wilder Jr . who ran for 895 yards and averaged 5.4 yards per carry.That isn't to say that the QB is the weakest area of the 2013 Florida State football team on or off the field (although it is), but the running game has a better chance of working with the talented running backs that FSU has this year. It's been a concern that the Seminoles don't put forth a great effort in getting the running backs some help, but this might be the year that the running game finally comes to fruition.2. The defensive front has a lot of youthWith the departure of All-American CB Vernon Hargreaves III and the absence of the two other All-Americans at corner (Leonard Johnson and Tony Washington) for the season, the defense as a whole has a lot to prove. The Florida State defense struggled to slow down teams last season, holding opponents to 14.2 points per game, second last in the SEC. That said, Florida State did win the game against Notre Dame by holding them to only 13 points in the first half.The defense did lose two starters to the NFL Draft last year, but the experience that was gained during that season could be a big boost to be back in 2014. Junior linebacker Reggie Northrup had 9.5 tackles for loss and 10.5 sacks over four seasons, senior defensive end Christian Jones had a career high 16.0 sacks and junior OLB Jarrad Davis had 9.0 sacks.
Pete Wentz: I Don't Know If I'd Ever Go Back to 'Saturday Night Live'In an interview with BuzzFeed in which the New Yorker's Ryan Lizza tried to get the singer to discuss "Saturday Night Live's" recent treatment of President Donald Trump, Wentz spoke with a surprising degree of candor about his relationship with the show.Wentz explained why "Saturday Night Live" has a "tremendous bias" against Democrats, which Lizza also pointed out "has nothing to do with political views.""No, no," Wentz said. "I don't mean it as a critique. I don't think there's anything you can say about political views that isn't a critique, by the way. I think it's a show. I think it's an institution to tell a bunch of jokes. I think it's a comedy show on a comedy network and I don't think anyone would question that," he said. "I haven't had the conversations with anyone higher up, but it's a television network. There are things that people want to see. They're like, 'Hey, we wanna see you do this thing.' I'm like, 'Why?' They've been like, 'If it's funny enough we will.' I don't agree with them and I don't agree with the content, but I understand how people have their own opinions about things that they like or don't like. It's not something I feel guilty about or like I wanna hide or anything. I think it's great and they deserve a lot of credit for all they put into it."The singer clarified that his stance is not the same as taking himself off the show: "No, I've never really taken myself off of any show. I mean, I've never done the Conan thing [in 2015, when he sat down with Conan O'Brien] and I've kind of never done a whole bunch of stuff in my life. I just like to listen and see what happens. I see what happens when things go right and I try to just enjoy the little parts where I can see what the guys are thinking and why they're reacting the way they're reacting and hopefully the audience is thinking the same about the show as we're. So I don't know what's going on that I don't like that I have to do or get behind, but I don't."
TRAINING: I'm always in shape. I go through cycles, you know what I mean, like being tired and being like, 'yeah, I'll train tonight,' and then in the morning I get up and training. I want it to be a constant battle to win the fight, so I train a lot.When and why did you start training for fighting?I started training when I was 16 years old. I was a boxer, so I trained for a while. I didn't train that long, but I trained hard, so I had a desire to become a fighter.What ranks and titles have you held?When I was in boxing, I didn't win any belts. I've won a couple, but it's nothing. I wanted to become a fighter, so I didn't even want to be in different weight divisions. When I was in boxing, all the boxing guys were fighting for titles and it was nothing to me, but now I don't even want that, I just want to fight, for me like that. I want to fight the best.What was your job before you started fighting?I was a delivery boy, a delivery boy in a bakery on the lower part of the East Coast, so you know what I'm talking about, right? I was in the delivery room delivering every day on the weekends. I went to school a couple hours a day, I was always playing basketball and basketball was my favorite game. When I was working, it was nothing much, but in the end I was always working. Then I wanted to open a bakery and I did that and I just did it for fun, you know what I mean?How did you get started in fighting?I was still boxing, and when I was in boxing, there were a lot of girls who wanted to fight, a lot of girls who trained at the gym and it's a lot of pressure on the girls who train to be a champion, to be a world champion and all that stuff. They're girls who have a lot of pressure on them already. They do this for a living, they do this for themselves, so the stress is high. Then, you know, when you become fighter, when the girls start getting in the ring, they get their own little world, so it's a lot less pressure for the girls, but for the boys it's a lot different and you know what I mean? It's hard for a boy. It's hard for one because it's not their job. You know what I mean? They say to a boy, 'hey man, come fight me.' So you know what, it's not about work, that's more my problem, it's more my life, and I'm really living right now, so, you know, this is a long way, but yeah.You know, it's better for everyone who's not trained to start doing this so it's more equal than when guys start doing this, so I started doing it because I want to be the best. I'm not in a sport where I wanna be the best so I really love that more, you know what I mean? I love the idea of fighting for no reason. I just love winning. I'm not in no league where I wanna be one of the contenders, I wanna be the one. I want to be the best, and I wanna do what I want to do. That's why I want to do it and that's why I love this sport more.How did you get into mixed martial arts?My girlfriend is actually my manager, so when she first started watching MMA, she saw a bunch of us, she went out to watch us, and my manager is a big name in fighting, so she went out and watched a lot of us. We had some fights and we lost and she was like, you know what, this is fun. I think the first time for me was when I went to the Ultimate Fighting Championship [about five years ago], and I'm telling you, I was watching the guys getting beat up, and I wasn't enjoying it. I'm here, how am I supposed to have fun when I'm watching guys beating each other up? My girlfriend said, 'hey, you have to do this,' and I said yeah, but she said 'oh no, you have to do this more.' Then she said, 'if you do this, the guys are gonna start doing it and people will like it and they'll be like, 'well this is crazy.' So, I went out and it was fun man, but it was all about the work man. It was really, really hard work man, like, you know what I mean? Once you do the weight cuts, the cardio, the sparring, all of that, you just go into this environment where like you just can't take it anymore, so you're at the point of
A team led by scientists at the University of California, Davis, has found that when scientists turn to alternative energy sources for their research, they're less likely to be "green" and more likely to be "yellow.""Our findings may help to explain why some countries promote energy conservation and sustainability while others, such as Brazil, have increased their dependence on energy that is produced from coal, nuclear, and natural gas," said Robert D. Richardson, an assistant professor in the Division of Biological Sciences at UC Davis and a member of the team.The results, published in the February issue of the journal Environmental Science and Technology Letters, are based on a study of nearly 1,000 studies from 20 countries around the world on the environmental impacts of alternative energy, including solar, wind, geothermal, hydroelectric, and biomass fuel sources and renewable energy technologies.Richardson analyzed the findings to assess what, if any, impact that alternative energy has on the planet by comparing its environmental impact with that of conventional energy sources."Our analysis focuses on the impact that alternative energy has on the environment, but ultimately what we discovered is that there is a trade-off with environmental impacts caused by conventional energy sources," said Richardson.Richardson said the results suggest that when researchers want to compare a new energy source to conventional technology, they should consider the impact those alternative energy sources might have on the environment before they move forward with research on energy alternative sources."This might not necessarily be something that environmental groups or governments need to take into account," he said.Previous comparisons of the environmental impact of alternative energy sources have been limited, because prior studies have been limited to laboratory or academic studies and have not included field studies, said Richardson.He said they are working on new ways to assess the impact alternative energy has on the environment and are considering what they'll call an environmental impact quotient in future studies.Explore further: The impact of alternative energy sources on the environment
The idea of an independent Scotland would be 'disastrous' for the UK, John Bercow has said.Mr Bercow said there was 'something quite interesting' about the prospect of an independent Scotland, but said it was not 'something that a British prime minister should be asking the EU about'.At the weekend the Scottish Government's official spokesperson said Mr Bercow had been 'wrong' in his comment.The SNP MP for Moray has said that he told EU President Jean-Claude Juncker during a meeting that if Scottish independence followed from Brexit the UK would be "in grave danger".The comments will cause embarrassment for the Brexit Secretary after he earlier attempted to play down growing support in Scotland for remaining in the EU.He also backed Nicola Sturgeon's right as First Minister to call a second referendum on independence.The Labour MP has argued that Scotland's European future is central to its identity.He said: "It has a great, great history, is in the midst of great change and would look to other parts of the UK with great concern if a new state were being formed in England that might seek to become a new state within Europe."He said he told Mr Juncker while sitting next to him on a plane to Strasbourg that Scotland would be "in grave danger" should it become an independent nation following the UK's vote for Brexit.Mr Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, told reporters: "There is something quite interesting about the prospect of an independent Scotland."He said: "Let me be frank - I'm opposed to the idea of an independent Scotland."There are important issues for the UK, there are big questions for the EU and for the whole United Kingdom. The Scots would be foolish to enter into something that is going to be disastrous."I would simply say to Mr Juncker and Ms Sturgeon - as I say to everyone - that if they're going to go into a new Scotland, they should call a referendum on what that new Scotland might look like."But I would suggest to them they would find a similar number on the other side."The SNP in particular is in a position to call a referendum on independence. It would be interesting to see exactly how people feel about that."There are other reasons why I do not think it would be right if the Scottish government were going to pursue a different course."He said Mr Juncker, the president of the European Council, had said that any break-up in the United Kingdom could impact the whole of Europe.He said: "There is something quite interesting about the prospect of an independent Scotland."It had a referendum to determine its future, a referendum in which 60 per cent of the voters voted to remain in the United Kingdom."You may think that's not fair, but it is their independence."
In his first year in office, President Barack Obama is proposing a series of sweeping changes in government. Now, with Congress under Republican control, Obama is looking to get his own way on a host of issues.The new proposal, released Monday, is an expanded version of a 2011 budget plan that is the second of four he released last year. All but the health-care program are included, but several policies, such as cutting funding for food stamps, are not.Here are five things to know:1. Obama wants to increase the debt ceiling — to avoid a "fiscal cliff." The proposed increase would be $2.3 trillion. The president wants to make sure Congress is on board before he takes the blame.This is a classic ploy by the president, who has repeatedly threatened to use executive action on his "gimmicks" should Congress not come through with a resolution, such as his immigration policy.2. Obama will be vetoing any spending bill that includes funding for his health-care reforms. The president supports the "public option," whereby people can buy into Medicare if they have a preexisting condition. But according to the administration, a health-care bill without the public option would be a tax increase that would hurt low-income Americans. The administration said on Monday that he would veto any legislation that doesn't include that provision.3. This is not a "Plan B." This proposal from the White House does not have a deadline. Rather, Obama said in April that he would veto any plan that did not have a long-term deficit reduction in place.4. This is not a "Plan C." The White House argues there is a consensus among Democrats, Republicans and the business community that an increase in the debt ceiling should be part of any deficit-reduction plan.5. This is not the first time Obama has threatened to use his executive authority to help get his agenda done. The White House has used that move twice, first in the fight over the Affordable Care Act and then in the debt ceiling debate earlier this year.Related: What will Obama do if he doesn't get his new budget plan passed?The "fiscal cliff," or the combination of massive tax increases and spending cuts that will hit on Jan 1 if Congress does not come together and implement a new budget, is on top of a massive $1.2 trillion increase in federal spending in fiscal 2011. Obama is hoping to avoid the tax hikes but also the spending cuts.And, as Congress does not have a formal budget to start from, Obama will have to take it step by step. He will try to get Congress to vote on his budget proposal, which may require a "cliff" deal.For example, Obama could agree to a deficit-reduction "grand bargain" that would be a compromise between the Republicans, who want steep cuts in social spending, and Democrats, who want higher taxes to fund infrastructure spending. That would still leave the debt on the rise.Even if lawmakers do come up with a deal on his budget, it will still have to be reconciled with lawmakers' spending plans, which they have not made public.
The government will pay for the legal bills of the people who caused a major riot and chaos during the Euro 2016 football tournament in France, and will also contribute €6m to €9m on the French police force in order to "dampen the damage".The French government is currently under attack for being ineffective and ineffective in preventing the violence which erupted during the French Euro 2016 final between Portugal and Croatia. This has resulted in accusations that the French authorities did NOTHING to stop the violence, but were actually "providing a platform" for the demonstrators.While the government is responsible for paying up the bills, they say that while funding is provided, they cannot directly participate in the protests, as the government does not want to have anything to do in the future, as it is still investigating the causes of the riots.This means that any protests which they decide to pay for will have to be done through the French police force, for whom the "dampening effect" will provide €500 per day, and which is not being paid for through the legal aid system.The protesters will be asked to pay for their legal bills in advance, in order to keep the money flowing in.On Tuesday, France's interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve admitted that the security measures implemented at the Euro 2016 tournament had only "made things worse".He said that France faced a problem of "exacerbating tensions" at future political events, and was going to "make sure that these incidents [which were] already very frequent and very intense for police, will be reduced".Photo: French police officer (R) and protester during violent clashes during the Euro 2016 football tournament in Lille, France (Getty)The government statement comes after it was confirmed yesterday (July 8) that France's Interior Minister Manuel Valls was going to resign from his post, after his request to prevent further violence during the Euro 2016 finals met with resistance.While the official statement from the French Interior Ministry doesn't mention exactly what would have been done, the comments from Bernard Cazeneuve indicate that the police forces in the UK and Switzerland would have provided police protection, in addition to providing "extra resources such as a police helicopter".The BBC reported that the €6m and €9m on police officers would be paid for by a "mock-up budget" for Euro 2016, and would be used to "dampen the damage" which the violence has caused.Photo: Police officers in front of barricades during riots between France and Hungary during Euro 2016 football matches on June 26, 2016, in Lille (AP)
The first time I ever saw "Jurassic World" was more than 12 years ago on the night the movie's director, Colin Trevorrow, took a break from the filmmaking grind of his new "Star Wars: The Force Awakens" trilogy to visit a theater in San Francisco called the Argyle. A couple of months into that trip, when a filmgoer sitting a few rows in front of me politely asked whether he would be interested in a preview of the two-hour runtime movie, I thought it a ridiculous question. I was there to see an arthouse hit, and I didn't take any time to look up which genres the movie fit within.Over the next 12 years, I have seen "Jurassic World" almost a dozen times. I have seen it more times than I can count. For the uninitiated, "Jurassic World" is an off-beat science-fiction action film about a boy (played by Bryce Dallas Howard) who stumbles upon a massive prehistoric dinosaur egg in San Francisco and is given the unique opportunity to bring the dinosaur back to life. It's a film about dinosaurs, boy genius, and humanity's quest to understand the evolution of life on Earth.It is also a science-fiction adaptation of "Jurassic Park," written by Steven Spielberg with a screenplay by Frank Darabont, that takes place during the late 1980s. It is a film as exciting for people of a certain stripe."Jurassic World" is not merely great as a science-fiction film. It is amazing as the first major motion picture to be in-depthly written and directed about the evolution of dinosaurs. It is a thoroughly modernized and modernized version of a science-fiction-flavored dinosaur classic.For one thing, "Jurassic World" is completely unlike anything that has ever been done in the genre of modernized dinosaur films before. It is, in many instances, more faithful to the source material than the later films in the "Jurassic Park" franchise.For other things, it is not in any way a prequel to the events of the first "Jurassic Park" — although Steven Spielberg might like to think so anyway. In fact, it is a re-imagining of events occurring more than a century before the events of the first film. Yet despite its wildly different origins, it is still a film that is all about modern humans interacting with ancient dinosaurs. Not only are the dinosaurs themselves modern humans, but many of our modern conveniences, such as elevators and the ability to shop online have dinosaurs as part of their DNA.Steven Spielberg's latest release is a modernized version of the popular 1980s film released in 2001. It isn't nearly as good a film. But like many movies directed by the famed filmmaker (there is something about Spielberg movies that people will come to love), it's a fantastic movie with amazing performances and a lot to say that I will try to say in a few paragraphs and even less time.It's all about dinosaurs and boy geniusThe premise of "Jurassic World" is a simple one: A boy and his father (Chris Pratt) are the only two people in the world who know that a dinosaur egg has been found in San Francisco and is at the San Francisco Zoo. What the dinosaur egg doesn't reveal is that the dinosaur is a genetically unique and dangerous animal. As the only people to encounter and successfully tame the dinosaur, the boy and his father decide that they will release the creature into the wild — and the only way that process will work is to bring it back to life.So when the two of them get in the Jeep driven by Owen (Ty Simpkins), the boy and father figure of Owen and Claire Dearing, a couple who lost their daughter on the Jurassic Park island, they just assume that they are being stalked. But Owen is not being stalked by some evil killer dinosaur, he's just in a bad mood, and he just wants one thing back: his wife.The reason for his outburst is that his fiancée is the woman standing next to Owen and Claire. She isn't there to meet Owen's love interest either. She's there to see a dead dinosaur.The film's title comes from the fact that the dinosaur has a scientific name, "Jurassic Park," which means "place of the beasts." This is an intentional point being made in a very clear fashion.It feels like a parody of a movie that came out during the 1980s"Jurassic Park" started in the mid-1990s, the same year the first of Steven Spielberg's films debuted. Like his later works, "Jurassic Park" has a large cast of characters (each one with his or her own defining character traits like a villainous dentist in this case) and a huge set of supporting characters whose motives and actions matter more
After a long and tumultuous week for the US military, General Raymond Odierno and others decided Sunday night to release the names of hundreds of Marines who will never deploy to battle but may still be assigned missions after Jan. 1.Odierno, the outgoing chief of staff of the US Army, said he made the decision after reflecting on his time at Fort Carson and looking at recent cases where service members who did go to Iraq and Afghanistan had come home with PTSD.He said the troops who are deployed "are not going to fight if they're not assigned to it. And the people that are assigned to it, they're not going to fight if they don't have a mission associated to it. And if they're sent where they don't have a mission, they'll come home damaged."He said the process for identifying which troops are being sent where is "quite complex" and requires the input of the "entire Joint Staff." He said that he's not aware that any of the troops in question have been deployed.The list released Sunday did not mention any names, but Odierno said he's concerned some of the troops on the list may have been sent to theater command, where they did not have a mission.Related: In Iraq, the US's Army Has Tried to Regain 'Fear'The Army's top commander told a Senate panel last week that he thinks a substantial number of Marines may have been sent to fight missions in Iraq or Afghanistan during 2012, a number that many top Army officers say is too high and could even be misleading.The list, released by the Pentagon about a week after a classified report was leaked that showed commanders had ordered troops deployed to Afghanistan beyond their mission objectives, does not include any troops who may have returned with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.Older troops on board US aircraft returning from war zones in places like Afghanistan had their names on the list, which included some sailors deployed to the Persian Gulf but not deployed to Afghanistan. According to the list, some of the sailors had been sent to Bahrain, where they weren't deployed during the course of their deployment.The list included service members who left Fort Carson and returned with PTSD. About 786 troops on the list from January 2005 through September 2009 were discharged with their service personnel records, according to Pentagon data.Related: What is Post Traumatic Stress Disorder?Other names on Sunday's release include troops who were sent to Iraq to begin a new role. It does not appear that any are named in the classified report, but a former Marine involved in that situation said some were sent to Afghanistan, where there was no mission and they suffered the trauma associated with that."The Marines at some point there lost the way of life by saying, 'We're gonna change the mission to a counterterrorism mission,' and that's not what happened," Robert Haddick, who is battling PTSD, told the Arizona Republic. Haddick said he was a gunner who was deployed twice, once to Iraq and once to Afghanistan, although he's not sure where that second deployment was.The Pentagon report found that the Army could not account for about 250 soldiers of its 1,200 active duty and Guard units who were given a diagnosis of "shellshock," a mental condition that can show up as symptoms of depression, nightmares and flashbacks, among other symptoms. The Army said that they do not have enough information to determine whether troops were sent to fight operations in Iraq, and that it is reviewing data to determine whether more were sent to fight.Some troops on Sunday's release were named because their deployment orders weren't immediately handed down. Some of the names weren't revealed because the soldiers didn't make formal complaints about their deployments. Other names were released because military officials said they had been medically discharged.
Hamas claimed it was responsible after a rocket was fired from an apartment block in the central Gaza Strip at Israel near the Erez crossing on Wednesday evening.The attack caused no casualties, but one Israeli was wounded by shrapnel, the army said. Another soldier was not hurt.The Israel Defence Forces said the rocket launched from a fourth-floor flat was a 122mm mortar.An IDF spokesman said the incident was under control, according to Israel Radio.The rockets were fired at 6.45pm (16.45 GMT), when they hit near the border in the central Gaza Strip near the Erez.The Israel Defense Forces tweeted that the army would respond "if a terrorist attacks Israel".Hamas's Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades claimed responsibility. Izz al-Din al-Qassam is the military wing of the Islamist movement.The Israeli military said the rocket was fired in response to Israeli air strikes in the Gaza Strip on Wednesday night.According to an IDF spokesman: "The IDF's air force shot down a terrorist rocket fired from Gaza into the Eshkol region."It targeted an open area, not any target within Israeli territory. There is a possibility that the terrorist also fired a mortar attack from other areas in the Beit Hanoun area."The IDF will respond to any terrorist attack against Israel," he said.Meanwhile Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri claimed that the organisation used a Hamas tunnel to fire at a border community in the southern Gaza Strip.Hamas has used tunnels to attack Israeli targets over the years.The IDF said no rockets were fired from the Gaza Strip during Wednesday: "On three separate occasions Hamas militants fired short-range rockets from the Strip towards Israel; and no hits were reported," the statement said.

The first few days of spring training are still two weeks away, but the Blue Jays are already at it.At a hastily-called news conference at spring training Tuesday afternoon, GM Alex Anthopoulos announced that Blue Jays centre fielder Jose Bautista was in town and, as of Wednesday afternoon, will likely play in Arizona with the Toronto Blue Jays on Thursday against the Kansas City Royals.Bautista, who is expected to make nearly $7 million this season, hasn't played since last September, when he underwent arthroscopic knee surgery. In a one-hour press conference on Tuesday — he was unable to comment on the Blue Jays' playoff chances — it was made clear that he is being "expedited" to see a specialist.So in the last nine hours, we've seen the Blue Jays open up about their most prominent offseason acquisition. The team announced that Bautista arrived at spring training and was to meet with Dr. James Andrews' team (Dr. James Andrews will be working on Bautista's surgery on Wednesday) for an examination to determine the best course of action for his knee rehab. Once that was done, it was to be determined whether or not he would be able to return to the field this year.The team will not comment on the status of its other outfielders this season, but the Blue Jays, on Wednesday afternoon, said Bautista was a significant part of their plans for this year."Jose Bautista is healthy, physically back, and he knows he has a team," manager John Gibbons said. "We have a great opportunity for him to come back healthy at some point. It's about the guys coming back in the lineup. It's an exciting thing for the organization."If Bautista were to return this season with an expectation of playing in around 40 games — an unlikely scenario for a man of his age and production — it only serves to underscore just how little is left in the tank for the 35-year-old.A team source indicated the Blue Jays' medical staff feels it's extremely safe to say Bautista will return to action in the next 11-15 weeks – the timeline the team has set for their outfielders to return — so long as he plays three games out of six in exhibition games. That schedule wouldn't place Bautista in Arizona until May 20 at the earliest but would give the Blue Jays their first game without Bautista since September 7, 2013.The Blue Jays would have had to have had one of their top three outfielders to have had them in the American League in the first place. It would only be a matter of when before they'd be able to avoid having their current trio of players, who won't go into the 2017 campaign with four years of club control, leave.In that regard, the Blue Jays aren't alone in their assessment of Bautista's long-term future. Even before his initial injury, the Blue Jays had decided that he should never be able to play again and they wouldn't be moving forward without having him as part of the future, if at all.For that reason, he will be playing with a different team next season and will not turn 32 until the start of the season. With so much uncertainty surrounding the left fielder's future, there will also be some debate about his return when the Blue Jays are able to return him to the field."I feel great," Bautista said on his way into the clubhouse. "I took good care of myself over the last couple of years, but I was playing baseball at high-level ball. It's something that will not only be with me, but something the rest of my career. To have the opportunity in the National League at this time in my career to come back, and have the support of the people that are here, I am very excited about it."After coming out of a winter in which his team wasn't contending from the back-end of the rotation to the top-end of the rotation, Anthopoulos is eager to not only get Bautista to play and play well, but his presence will be a key component for the Blue Jays' plans as they head into the offseason.Bautista still has an out clause in his contract, but that's about the extent of what Bautista has left. There will be a question mark over whether the Blue Jays will even re-sign the outfielder during the winter meetings, but with both players at 30 years old next February and already under contract through the end of the 2015 season, it makes sense to leave them both in the fold.This doesn't mean that the team has ruled out the possibility of trading either or both players as the deadline approaches, since there could be other assets to trade to acquire more pitching to help replace starter David Price, who has been ruled out for at least another month, if not longer.
The Canadian PressOTTAWA -- A major political fight is brewing in the Senate over a rule change introduced last year designed to protect Canadians accused of terrorist activity from deportation.Opponents accuse the Liberal government of rushing the controversial legislation through the upper chamber without fully consulting Canadians or Parliament.The government argues the changes will improve safety in Canada by cracking down on people who become radicalized and try to move to the Middle East to join terrorist groups."With this new measure, we are ensuring that the laws that are in place to protect Canadians from crimes are working the way they should," Immigration Minister Ahmed Hussen said during Question Period Tuesday.But the Opposition argues the government is rushing through legislation without properly consulting with Canadians before introducing it."They have rushed through these changes for political purposes," Conservative interim leader Rona Ambrose said before Question Period.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has also come under fire for a number of changes to the legislation.The legislation, which the Liberals say are needed to speed up the deportation of foreign nationals who are a threat to national security, includes two new lines for judges to consider when determining whether someone should be deported.One part of the legislation says a judge may consider a person's "conditions of release or safety in the community," which could mean parole or a probationary period given their criminal history, as well as the impact they will have on society, family and community."Are they a danger? Are they likely? Are they marginal? What does the public think of them? Is the public fearful?" asked Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Minister John McCallum before the legislation passed in June 2016."Those will be the criteria," he added.The second new section of the legislation adds language to the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act that defines a danger to the public as:a knowing failure to comply with a condition of release or parolethe continued presence in Canada of an individual who has committed a crimea person who poses a danger to the public while being under the control or supervision of someone who is known to be or reasonably believed to be a danger to the public's wellbeinga person who commits a crime while on baila person who is likely to commit a crime.But critics say it is also vague and vague language has the capacity to ensnare law-abiding Canadians in new legal and financial problems.The Conservative government tabled the legislation with virtually no amendments this fall in the House of Commons.After passing unanimously, the bill was sent to the Senate, which is in charge of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. There were no plans to amend the bill before it was released on Jan. 23 -- an extraordinary legislative move.A week later, a parliamentary committee tabled an almost 250-page report on the bill before MPs were supposed to have the final say on whether to send it to the Senate, and no amendments were being discussed by the Senate's legal and constitutional affairs committee as of Wednesday morning.The committee found the changes in the bill were "inadequate" and that the legislation could result in "dramatic" unintended consequences, such as depriving foreign nationals, including dual citizens and Canadian residents, of their constitutional rights..At the time the bill was introduced, some critics said Canada's Immigration and Refugee Protection Act was in "disrepute," with few legal protections given to detained suspects.The bill was also criticized for not making it clear for Canadians who are being deported whether their permanent residency will be affected.The Liberals said the law was amended to address those concerns this fall and that they were "committed" to making sure that the bill would "ensure that all Canadians enjoy the right to due process under the law."
For more than two years, this writer's only contact with a real, live Democrat happened to be the daily briefing, in which members of the party's "policy" and advocacy divisions briefed the press corps about the progress in Congress toward implementing Obama administration legislative agenda items.I was at that breakfast when a young woman, who had already read a few hundred stories about Sarah's campaign — all of the press — stood during the briefing and began talking."It's not about Hillary," she said. "It's not about her. She's not the one."As the briefing continued, the young woman got louder. "What I say to people is that Hillary is nothing. She's a symbol. She isn't what we need. We need something more."That young woman — who worked for this author at a high-profile national Democratic outlet — is me. I'm talking to you today because, as I write this, I'm on a road trip, where I will visit four states with Republican officials — all of them, at least publicly, committed to cutting spending on public education and defunding Planned Parenthood. I've come to them because, in their own way, I'm hearing exactly what the young woman I just described said.In a political and media culture that has been obsessed by the idea of Hillary Clinton as the next Barack Obama, Clinton's candidacy may appear to be in trouble. Yet, if we look a little deeper — if we keep our eyes on the prize and not the smoke — we realize that she is in much better shape than most people would expect, and that it's not so much "Clinton" that's in the way as much as "politics and media."Yes, of course we all want to know who's really going to win. We all want to know what Hillary represents, what she brings to the table that Obama doesn't. We all want to know what she'll do if elected.Yet as I travel the country, I'm seeing a different focus on Hillary: the focus of those people in the White House briefing room — the people tasked with giving them answers to media queries. That way, she's an equal, to be studied, to be challenged and to be challenged again.And I can see the payoff from that emphasis. Hillary wins — for the media, the White House and ultimately the country.The media, of course, will never give up on Hillary, even in a year that would otherwise be an excellent one for her campaign. That's because she still represents — at least to them — the status quo, the way things were. And, I suspect, her campaign will continue to represent the status quo in the weeks, months and even years ahead.I don't know how long I'm going to stay in this race. I certainly hope I'll return. But for now, I am in it because I believe I can take my message to the American people and convince them it's time to return power to the people.Now when I talk to the Democrats who come to these gatherings, I listen to them, I listen, because I hear a message more consistent than any one of Hillary's own policy positions. And it's one that they have heard a hundred times before: the idea that the people control our government.When Democrats get too excited, they sound just like Democrats, too. But the people have only to hear the truth in a headline to see the value that comes from a return of power.When I talk to those Democrats on the road I'm hearing a very different message.***The young woman who spoke to me a few weeks ago was a college student, as well as a Bernie Sanders supporter, an undecided voter or just someone who had "never had a reason to vote Democrat."On her own, she was already on record on one major issue — her belief that abortion should only be legal in the early stages of pregnancy. She was a Bernie Sanders girl at a time when no Democrat or Republican had ever held a similar stance. She also was a millennial, a part of a generation that is increasingly being raised without a father in the home.But her real break with the Democratic Party began on Jan. 15. That was when a young, white, male Republican with a deep and passionate desire to repeal Obamacare, defund Planned Parenthood and cut taxes for the wealthy suddenly became the face of her party.Just a few weeks earlier on March 14, she was doing just what she does on a daily basis: studying up on the candidates.On this particular day she was reading the Washington Post's explainer on the GOP health care bill.That morning, she noticed she still had some questions, so she called her friend in the state Legislature, who happened to be a Democrat. He advised her to call her state party chair."I said, 'What you're saying about healthcare is so
The first time I watched this movie, it really messed me up. I was not expecting the ending and the character, who I thought had been a main character of the movie was killed and then we were told that it was a mistake, and the movie was over. However, I went the next day and watched it again and I did not see the mistake and the movie did not end. The movie did not go on for me as I started to like the character, I started to care for the character, and my love of the movie never stopped.I still get the sense that this movie could have been better. What I liked about this movie was the fact that it shows the power of friendship and how difficult it is if we are not careful, and it shows the importance of friends and the way they change a person, and how powerful the bond between a sister and brother could be. The movie does show a bit of jealousy, which can be a powerful emotion, but the movie always shows the bond between brother and sister and reminds us that sisters can help their brothers do even more. The movie also depicts a friendship between two friends and the importance of friendship is always portrayed in this movie. The movie also portrays life and the value of life and how good friends can make everyone happy. I think that this movie is a very good movie, it shows that when one is not careful of one's actions or when one is not careful with one's friends, life can be very painful, and people can die and that the bond between a sister and brother becomes so strong that if you can keep your friends, they will save your life on one day, and that the power of friendship is greater than the power of hate or the power of evil.This movie was a great gift to me because I like to think that friendship is the greatest power that a person could have, and a great thing about this movie is that there is no hatred displayed in the movie. Although there is a bit of jealousy between the brother and sister, and she may think about her brother's girlfriend, it never shows the person actually hating him. This movie is very easy going and has a kind of happy ending, and I really feel that all I can say is that this movie was so good that I will have to sit for a long time after this movie because I will have to watch it over and over again. I really think that this movie is one of my favorites because there is a lot in it and I think that this movie will last me a very long time and I have enjoyed many of the movies I have seen in my life, but this movie was the most enjoyable, and I loved every moment of it.This movie shows a brother and a sister that cannot control their emotions very well and that if we are not careful what we could do to someone, we could cause them to die, or we could hurt someone very very much if we have not learned how to control our emotions and when we are at a point to kill someone or hurt someone, or we are at a point to do something to someone that our lives, and if we live through it and we learn how to control our emotions we can change. I think that this movie shows the kind of bond that can be formed between two persons in a few years, and that a brother and sister should not be separated; I think that the movie is a wonderful movie, and I loved every minute of it. If you are interested in seeing this movie, I have to go to my local DVD store that is located on North Boulevard in Los Angeles so I will probably have to wait some time until the new year to watch it again.
Catherine Deneuve, a member of the French parliament's lower house, said on Monday the case should serve as a reminder that "people who are not Muslims don't behave differently".'They are not French'"French Muslims must be informed in a very clear way that there will be consequences if you insult a French person who is not a Muslim," she said.On Sunday, an off-duty police officer reportedly saw the alleged assault take place, but declined to intervene.The lawmaker told TV channel iTele: "What does justice look like? The accused should be told in a very clear way that if someone insults the dignity of another, then there will be consequences," she said."These young kids shouldn't be sent out to serve or hunt in the streets. They are not French."According to the prosecutors' office, the attacker ran into the market "unattended" and the police did not know who to take in for questioning.The attacker was arrested on Saturday at the scene and was held on suspicion of assault with a weapon.France has been on high alert for terror attacks since Islamist militants took to the streets in the deadly Paris attacks on November 13, killing 130 people and wounding 368.The attack has led to widespread fears across the nation and has led to a nationwide security clampdown, including a 3,000-strong police force and a 3,800-strong airport police force.According to a poll conducted by the CSA on Saturday night, 52 percent of French said they feared a terrorist incident in the coming days, compared with 44 percent a month ago.Explore further: Paris police arrest 5 men in market machete attack
The New York City school principal who was ordered on Monday to take a two-day unpaid leave by Gov. Andrew Cuomo after a photo of her smiling with convicted teacher and "fitness expert" Thomas Curran was broadcast on a news outlet, said she will not quit."My job is never going to be what you make of it," Stephanie E. Stepanek said in a statement published Monday night in the New York Daily News.In the photo — which surfaced last Friday in several tabloids — Ms. Stepanek can be seen smiling with a man she has said she knows only as Curran during a gym class in the Bronx after the teacher was caught giving her a lift downtown on Monday. Ms. Curran was indicted last month along with 30 other teachers and administrators on charges that they conspired to manipulate students by giving them improper nutritional advice for weight management.Mr. Cuomo on Monday said that the school should fire the principal until the investigation concluded, and he announced that she would be suspended from work for two days during an investigation into her role as a possible co-conspirator in Ms. Curran's scheme."The photo was a violation of many standards of conduct that any adult employee should not accept from a minor. I will continue to examine every aspect of this case to ensure that any and all appropriate disciplinary actions are taken," Mr. Cuomo said.The governor's office did not say what Ms. Stepanek will be fired for or what prompted the investigation. The Daily News reported that Ms. Stepanek is a lawyer, but The Post could not pinpoint anything about her work that would have made her a potential suspect.State education officials said they learned about the photo on Friday afternoon when several New York newspapers published it in full. Education officials said that in addition to the photo showing Ms. Stepanek smiling, there appeared to be a smile with her hand covering her mouth."This appears to be a photo that a parent or a teacher or someone else did not realize the extent to which it should have been taken," said James G. Shea, director of New York's Department of Education. He cited rules and codes of professional conduct that regulate the appearance of schools' principals and other school personnel, including the "standard that no staff member should be photographed or filmed in a compromising manner that depicts them in a manner that gives the appearance of a person."The District Attorney of the Bronx, Robert Johnson, told the Daily News he was working with the Police Department to trace the photographer, whom The News said did not have permission to be there. He said Mr. Stepanek told him about the photo as investigators started their investigation Sunday."She thought it might appear that someone did it on purpose and she wasn't comfortable with it," he told the newspaper. "She felt it was inappropriate because someone would publish it with her appearance and in a compromising situation."Mr. Johnson said that if the photo was inauthentic then nothing should be made of it because he did not believe Ms. Stepanek had anything to do with the photo being used.A person who appeared to be with Ms. Curran in the photo contacted the school to notify principal Ms. Stepanek about the photo.The person told the Daily News that Mr. Curran did not know Ms. Stepanek had taken the picture.Ms. Stepanek was appointed principal of North High School in the Bronx a year and a half ago."She always seemed to have a smile on her face when she came into the school, but now I'm just worried about whether or not I'll be able to continue my work," the parent said.A spokeswoman for the New York State Department of Education said in an e-mail that Ms. Stepanek, a first-year principal, will continue to serve in a volunteer capacity. "We wish her all the best," the statement said.Copyright © 2018 The Washington Times, LLC. Click here for reprint permission.
Spencer Platt/Getty ImagesIf you ask Donald Trump, it's not that he wants to deport all noncitizens. The candidate has called for a policy of deporting only "violent, bad dudes." In his first public remarks on the subject on Wednesday, however, Trump did not call for anyone to be deported who has no criminal record and who has paid all state and local taxes.John Dickerson John Dickerson is a co-anchor of CBS This Morning, co-host of the Slate Political Gabfest, host of the Whistlestop podcast, and author of Whistlestop and On Her Trail.Instead, he vowed, under the new administration, to "suspend the issuance of visas to all countries until we complete an vetting process to stop terrorist and criminal acts against our people. Anyone from any country who's traveled to Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, or any other country where terrorism is ongoing, we're going to ask for our passports and we're not going to let them in. They're not going to be allowed back in until we can properly screen them." He added that "we are now going to begin enforcing very important rules that were not in place by Barack Obama and which will protect us all."AdvertisementThat's a big shift, and it will go over some heads. Trump clearly didn't mean it when he said, in 2015, "We have enough problems in this country. I think everybody would agree with me that we have enough problems. So we should turn off the terrorists and let's keep our country safe."But if all noncitizens wanted to go home, this policy would apply in a big way. It's hard for anyone to have a "violence problem" and not be a citizen, as the New York Times reported in September. It's hard to be a "criminal problem"—especially for a mass murder victim—unless you're a law-abiding felon. (For immigrants who have committed minor crimes, such as driving under the influence, the system might just apply that the crime was "self-inflicted" because the defendant was "so incapacitated that he didn't know what he was doing and didn't stop himself," as the Times reports.) The country's immigration police would have to devote every available day of their time to catching noncitizen offenders of all kinds, and even some of the crimes for which they receive the most attention. The result, according to the Times, would be increased costs for state and local governments.The Obama administration tried it this way and came up with a disaster.When the Obama administration tried it this way and came up with a disaster, Attorney General Loretta Lynch did not hesitate to call it "unlawful" and to announce criminal prosecutions for anyone who violates the new rules. The result was a massive wave of raids in the weeks after the November election, which left immigrant families in "fragile" positions and traumatized the communities they lived in.AdvertisementIf Trump puts in place an immigration policy like that, the same people who will be hurt—lawful permanent residents, parents of citizens, and children of lawful permanent residents—are likely to complain loudly. The president-elect is promising to replace the Obama administration's lawlessness with "the rule of law and respect for citizens' rights"—a new slogan for his campaign. But those words ring hollow. His approach would go about as far as we can go on immigration in the first few months of his presidency: He would continue to allow millions of immigrants to come and stay.It gets worse. Trump is threatening to cancel all visa issuances, even to spouses and other family members of visa holders, as the Times reported last week. So while his new policy would allow noncitizens to visit the United States without a visa, visa holders would not be allowed back unless the Trump administration can prove that the noncitizen will not pose a security threat, and the visa holder will be removed once the threat has passed. That would make the US travel and tourism industry nervous that the country has taken a giant step toward deporting its citizens.The Trump ban would end many of the programs that allow people to live and work legally around the United States, including student and employment visas.What this would do to immigrants who commit felonies will be uncertain. (You may remember "dreamers" who came of age during the Obama administration to become a part of the American family and are now adults, and who were not protected by the Obama policy.) But it's unlikely to make much difference. Those who commit a violent crime and are not in the country illegally, as Trump claims he will do, should already be deported. The same goes for the estimated 11 million unauthorized immigrants who have not committed any crime but nevertheless live here illegally—some of the families and friends of the Dreamers and the Dreamers as well. The Trump ban would end many of the programs that allow people to live and work
"We have a huge problem," said Thomas Schellman, an environmental specialist. "We're building so much of our urban space without it being built at all." That, in turn, leads to sprawl, more pollution, greater traffic congestion, and a larger carbon footprint.The city's zoning code and other regulations are designed to make the space necessary for development and to encourage compact living. "But the current regulations and the zoning code are all geared toward single-family homes," Ms. Schellman said, who argues that "it's wrong not to make the space necessary for the future."The problem has led the city to look for other solutions.Image David Gies, the city's planning chief, said more people in the city meant more traffic and more pollution. Credit Mike Groll/Associated PressMany cities are taking steps to encourage the creation of more urban "urban villages" where single-family neighborhoods and suburban-style strip malls are integrated with each other into denser and more sustainable urban villages. These developments are often built adjacent to existing, more prosperous communities.Advertisement Continue reading the main storyNew Brunswick was one of the first cities to implement the plan, which is known in the industry as "town-homes." They are intended to provide a mix of housing options — for instance, housing for singles and seniors, while still keeping the street parking available for automobiles. The code allows homes with garages up to a certain size — two cars each — and limits the size of new homes.A recent development in downtown New Brunswick, called Port Jefferson, is designed with what the developers call a "micro-unit" concept. The units are two stories and come with one bedroom and a tiny living room that leads to a bedroom and washroom.Mr. Gies said that while the zoning code provides for the development of multiple apartment buildings with ground floor retail, "people need to realize that some of them are better used as apartments than they are as retail."Another way cities say they want to encourage the creation of denser, healthy suburbs is by zoning communities so that developers of single-family homes may build smaller apartments rather than new single-family houses. This could help limit the growth of single-family homes, but it could also limit the overall density of the neighborhood.New Brunswick is one of a few metropolitan areas in the nation to have successfully implemented the approach.PhotoThe city has the most restrictive zoning code in the country — requiring 1,200 square feet per square foot for single-family homes, and up to three times that amount for apartment buildings. That means that if developers want to build single-family homes, they can only build to those restrictions — not the rules that apply to apartments.The result is a patchwork of apartments with multiple-family units and a very wide array of neighborhoods. Most neighborhoods have single-family houses that are no more than two stories tall in order to qualify as an apartment."The zoning code is based on a lot of assumptions about what the neighborhood population is in terms of people who are going to move in and out," said Peter Steinbaum, a New York architect who runs New Brunswick's Urban Design and Development Board. "If you can change that, you make a real difference for the whole community and for the city."The approach has been successful in New Brunswick, he said, despite the fact that it has been applied in many other cities throughout the country, and even in other countries.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

New Brunswick requires only the minimum number of stores — no fancy parking lots — and allows developers to add as much as they want in parking structures, parking lots or in parking spots. In addition to the stores, many new suburban communities have replaced single-family houses and built apartment buildings with large complexes with multiple-family homes in each unit.The approach in New Brunswick is based on "smaller apartments with smaller footprints and greater density," said Peter DeMarco, the director of development services for the city.Advertisement Continue reading the main storyThe city's new zoning code, known as the New Brunswick Modern Zone, comes into effect this year, in time for the city to consider plans to build an even more dense version, he said.On the surface, the new approach may
You can make a lot of money selling your old cellphones. Not when they're a year or two old, but once they've lost the ability to operate as a phone.The new Moto G -- Google's $200 Android smartphone -- will start at $300 or $350 new if you want to be able to use it as a traditional phone.But it's not all about the money anymore. Not when you can take out another $50 or $100 to replace the battery and SIM card before you send the old phone off to a scrap yard.The Moto G offers a unique experience when it comes to selling phones. You can use it as a phone, or you can buy used and resell it once it doesn't work any more as a phone.You can make a lot of money selling your old cellphones. (Photo: Chris Ratcliffe, Bloomberg)As long as the new phone is under warranty and the battery has at least a three-year warranty -- something you can't do with an older phone -- you're pretty much going to be OK. And you're also free to buy other used phones instead of buying the new one if that's your preference.Selling used phones is a great way to make money for people who don't have very much money. But what happens if you sell a phone like this after just months or a year has passed? Do you have the option of replacing the phone? And how many hours does Apple require to charge credit card details for a used iPhone before it will reject it, and refuse to sell you an unlocked device?We decided to find out. And we've sent our questions to Apple (AAPL), Motorola and Motorola's European distributors.1. Will the refurbished Motorola Moto G still run as a phone?Yes. They will.Motorola Moto G first generation, from left: A 16 GB SD Card, Camera and Battery. (Photo: Motorola)2. Will the refurbished Moto G still work with Google (GOOGL) services?Yes.Motorola Moto G on second generation. (Photo: Motorola)3. What can you trade in for the upgrade?As long as the phone is under warranty, you're pretty much OK. You can buy a new phone with a two-year warranty, but there's probably no guarantee you'd be allowed to use it otherwise.For the Moto G 2, you can trade in your old phone for a new one that comes with all the latest software, and a free three-year warranty.Motorola will also pay you to get the phone's SIM card, power adapter, battery and battery charger. It may not cover the cost of a replacement phone, but Motorola says it will make sure you get what you're owed if you don't pay for the swap."If a customer doesn't make payments on their new Moto G, they cannot continue to receive the upgrade to the latest software and warranty," said a statement on Motorola's website.4. If you want to sell to a store, can you use your phone?Technically, you can: They won't refuse to sell you a phone unless they're sure it can only still work as a phone. Still, some brick and mortar stores will probably only accept refurbished phones.You can also ask Moto to send you a new device, but Motorola says customers will have to send the phone back and pay for shipping costs before they can go ahead. It says it's not responsible for this.Motorola Moto G with 16 GB of storage. (Photo: Verizon Wireless)5. How to make money selling your old phone?Motorola says it's already having quite a few successful sales -- at least for them -- and they keep their customers informed, so they'll know who's buying their phones.They have an app called MyMobie, which shows a list of contacts you may know based on their phone carrier or location. You then pick the phone you want and get to know each contact, so you can decide if you'll sell it.The only downside is that it costs 30 bucks a month to use.And, there's no way to send out the phones via text message, or make calls because they don't allow them."It would be nice to be able to buy that phone on Amazon or eBay and offer it to customers," said Eric Gullienera, manager of consumer products at Sprint (S).A list of locations for the refurbished Moto G 2 in the major U.S. carriers as well as other U.S. retailers and retailers based in Europe are below.NortheastAT&T1.99Virgin Mobile$30Verizon Wireless$30W
When he was elected in January, Donald Trump told the press, "I am the least racist person that you have ever seen in your entire life." Now we've got proof.In a new book published this week, journalist and author Steve Coll recounts a 2005 interview with Donald Trump in which the then-business titan discussed his lack of racist beliefs.According to Coll, Trump told Coll, "I've never said anything racist in my life."He added in the book, "Trump has said that while he wasn't very religious, he didn't mean to denigrate any one religion. He said 'I don't like to insult people because they might have low IQ's' and 'I've never said any of that stuff about the blacks.'"He also said that, if elected president, he wouldn't take up too much of the nation's time and attention by talking about how he wasn't racist or doing racist things," Coll said.Coll told the Washington Post that a spokesman for Trump said the former reality TV star "denies having made the remarks at all.""He says he's not a racist, which is a difficult thing to do. To deny that is to confess guilt," Coll said.But it's not a bad thing that Trump is talking about race. There have been reports of racial tensions between minority communities and white people, and Trump's comments could be helpful to those of us who feel like it's getting better but can't quite say when we last felt anything more positive.[Washington Post]

With such an amazing cast on board you really couldn't ask for more. It really helped that the film was made on a small budget ($5 million less than its budget of $60 million) and that it starred an ensemble cast.8.

Brisbane Lions legend Mark Williams is among the nominees to lead the Blues' new AFLW team and the club's CEO says he is well qualified to take on the role.Williams led Geelong Women's Football Club to an AFLW premiership in 2008 and returned to the club as its chairman in 2009, before serving as senior coach (2010-12), managing director (2013-15) and executive director (2016-17).His time as chairman will conclude at the end of this month but he is widely tipped to succeed interim CEO Peter Schwab, who announced he would stand aside at the end of the season."Mark was a very strong advocate for our growth in women's AFL, and he obviously brings a lot of experience on the women's side as well into an AFLW role," Lions CEO Greg Swann told AFL.com.au."[Mark Williams is a] genuine champion of this game and I am sure he will do it well."Swann said that Williams — a member of the AFLW Hall of Fame — would also play a key role in establishing the Brisbane club as a player recruitment and development base for the AFLW.The Lions will formally announce their new AFLW side on Monday.Swann said the club was excited at the prospect of launching a new women's competition in Brisbane."This is a huge step forward in our continued growth and development of the game," Swann said."From a club, sporting and social management perspective the Brisbane Lions is delighted to take part in this new AFLW competition," he said."We intend to be a strong community partner within AFLW to engage youth with the Lions and to play our part in cultivating and nurturing a passionate, passionate and successful AFLW team, competing within Brisbane."The Lions are also poised to secure their own AFLW sponsorship with a partnership with W-G Sports Limited, the club's parent company."We are delighted to announce a relationship with a premier partner in WG Sports Limited which will secure an integral place in WG's football operations and support the development of the Brisbane Lions' female football program and associated football development programs at the club," Swann said.
The story of the death of King Edward I (1327-1377) was the catalyst for the Wars of the Roses, an unprecedented conflict which broke apart England and claimed many lives. Edward and his sister Queen Philippa were murdered by their cousins in 1455. The most famous English king of the Tudor dynasty, Richard III (1377-1483), then succeeded to the throne, a fact which became the subject of legends and myths.Richard was only the second medieval monarch of the dynasty after Edward, and he quickly established himself as an aggressive and ruthless warrior. Richard was crowned on November 11, 1483, and a year later he attacked and took control of the southern part of England from the rebel lord William de la Pole. Two-and-a-half months later, on April 24, 1485, Richard laid siege to the city of York. Richard had been in England for the past three weeks, since the city had fallen to French forces.On October 21, 1485, after a battle with his French allies, Richard defeated and killed the city's ruler, the Earl of Leicester, and took the royal treasury hostage. The following month, Richard proclaimed himself King of England. On September 11, 1486, the day after Richard completed the formal coronation as king, he left England and sailed to France on his way to France, his intended destination. Although it seems a bit contradictory at first, Richard was actually returning to England for the purpose of returning the treasury he had seized at York to the crown.Once King of England, Richard had an immediate need to make money. On September 19, 1486, he began negotiations with a French noble named Nicolas of Montferrat. The terms of this agreement spelled out the terms of the surrender. Nicolas owed Richard money, and he also owed Richard's father, King Richard II (1371-1483), for land granted to him by Richard's father, Richard III (1377-1483).Richard offered to sell a section of his northern territories in return for the land owed to him. Nicolas then agreed (December 12, 1486) to trade the northern territories for a portion of Brittany (now known as Flanders) in return for the land granted to Richard by Edward IV.Nicolas's son, Henry de Montfaucon, agreed to the terms with King Richard during a summit in Paris. Richard returned to England on December 29, with a force of around 50,000 soldiers and 100 warships he assembled in Brittany. Richard's troops were armed with swords, lances, and crossbows. They landed on the eastern bank of the River Seine (the river in the heart of Brittany). The army crossed to the western bank of the Seine, and then met and massacred a large group of Frenchmen and a small group of Englishmen, before settling near the city of Gueldre.Richard proceeded to destroy the town of Gueldre. Before his troops set foot on the town, Richard had himself crowned, in what has become known as the Massacre of Gueldre. Although the town was mostly burned, the houses, and other structures in the town were unoccupied at the time.On March 10, 1487, Richard and his forces reached Gueldre. According to one account, Richard sent a messenger into the city to negotiate with the king and his men, but the messenger was murdered. By the time Richard's messenger returned, Richard had already moved on and had set up his forces outside Gueldre.Richard's men then cut the city's water supply, and Richard had his son, William, personally lead his troops on the assault, leading off the army in front of the city, with the bulk of his forces around the cathedral (Cerf, 2005), which housed the town's water supply. The attackers then burned the town.The battle lasted between seven and eight hours until Richard's forces were overwhelmed. Many historians have pointed out the irony in Richard's claim that the battle was a victory, since the siege had lasted only two (two-and-a-half) days, as well as the fact that Richard had sent his son to attack the garrison at Gueldre (Germain, 2004) even though Richard's men had burned that garrison, and killed many of its occupants.William was proclaimed king by his father and queen the next day, March 11 in what became known as the Great Feast, marking the first time English kings had held their own coronation. William's reign was marked by conflict with the rebels, and in 1489, William invaded Wales with an army, and conquered the country and captured the King Edward IV and the Duchess of Gloucester.The Siege of RouenOnce Richard's army was defeated at Rouen (November 4, 1487) and his forces were dispersed, he moved his army southeast to attack the northern territories of the English nation.

As the new year gets going, we present our list of Top 25 Movies of 2014.This is how we decide which movies deserve our attention for this edition of the site; we rank our top movies based on five criteria:Criteria – 1. Screenplay– 2. Writing– 3. Production Design– 4. Editing– 5. ScoreFor our first installment, we will take a look at the Writing Criteria, a list of some of the best screenplays published in 2014.So let's see what other factors did we take into account to determine the list.1. Quality of StoryWe first considered the story, and in particular the character arcs and plot line. What is the theme of the movie? What are the themes we would expect to see explored? How does the story explore that theme?The following criteria are then used to determine the best stories published in 2014. You will notice the numbers listed in parentheses. These are the minimum values we look for, in order of their importance.Including the first number in a series always means that the higher the number, the more importance the film has in the larger scheme of things.As an idea, the first number indicates the importance of the first number and then the value of each subsequent number becomes less important.If all numbers are listed as positive, it may mean the film is high quality, but does not necessarily mean it's the best. If all numbers are listed as negative, it may mean the film was of low quality or it may have been a total mess of a movie.For the purpose of ranking, we don't judge this category, but we included it here just in case you decided to do so.2. ThemeThemes are interesting and unique things that we want to explore further in our minds. We want to see things we don't normally see in a movie.The following criteria are then used to determine the best and least interesting themes published in 2014.If you're a fan of film, we certainly know the importance of theme and I'm personally surprised a bunch of people choose to ignore them! We want to see new things, not things we've seen before.3. Storytelling SkillThe following criteria are then used to determine a character's skill in their individual skill. This is a subjective way of classifying skills.We looked at the characters and how they related to one another. The greater the bond they have and how they react to adversity, the higher the character's skill.In our experience, a good script and a good direction are both very important. This was determined by determining the direction of a movie, but we also looked at dialogue and direction throughout.When writing a screenplay, we are always looking for new ideas, while directing a movie is always looking for new ways to deliver on the theme.We will look at these two criteria in more detail with our next article, and you can read more about why these criteria matter in the next entry of this series. (hint hint)4. Adaptation of original storyThis is pretty self-explanatory. We look to look at movies that take an original story and adapt it to new form. This can be done with the help of actors, story and plot.5. CinematographyThis refers to how the film's cinematography makes sure its story is presented correctly. This is important, because we want audiences to have a clear impression of the story they are watching.The following criteria are then used to determine the Best Cinematography of 2014.
Cape Town – South Africa's Olympic gold medallist Sarsaane was arrested Thursday after an incident that saw the athlete punch and beat a South African customs official at a Johannesburg airport.The incident occurred when Sarsaane was attempting to fly back from Rio de Janeiro on Tuesday to South Africa. The former track and field medalist was carrying a return-to-Port Elizabeth ticket when the incident occurred.He was released on a police bail of Sarsaane R1 000 after being arrested.According to police the incident began when Sarsaane's ticket was held up at the immigration control by an immigration officer. Sarsaane was told "the immigration officer was the one who held the passenger's ticket at the airport."Sarsaane denied punching the officer, saying it was "a misunderstanding.""This misunderstanding has been resolved between the parties and the officer has already left the premises. Our focus now is to ensure that there is no repeat."I have been informed that [the immigration officer] may be suspended pending further investigation."But a spokesman for the customs department said they would investigate the matter further, and were looking for any further evidence.Cape Argus reported that Sarsaane was arrested following his arrest in the airport but he had yet to hear the exact details.He was immediately taken to the Johannesburg police station and charged with assault.Earlier in the day police had said it was a misunderstanding that caused the incident – instead of a possible punch, the security official may have been pushed.The gold medallist's agent had also denied he had assaulted the official."I've spoken to Sarsaane's brother, who is with him now, and they are in a state of shock," said Sarsaane's agent, who could not be identified."I'm hearing this has been a misunderstanding and Sarsaane would like to clear the air in this matter. He is very upset."Sarsaane, who won gold at the 2012 London Olympics and bronze in 2016, did not make the official flight back to South Africa to compete in the 400m relay final on Friday. He had trained earlier in the week in the UK.
"He [Putin] is not going to stand up; he's going to retreat," McCain said on CBS's Face the Nation.ADVERTISEMENT"He's got the most powerful country in the world backing him up and he can't stand up to the United States."Putin will make his first post-election visit to Turkey, although there has been no talk of a meeting. Putin could also meet with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.Putin has repeatedly said that his actions in Ukraine are not aimed at any particular country or region.At the same time, Russian state media — including Russia Today, Sputnik and the state-run Sputnik agency — have been aggressively broadcasting stories and commentary favorable to Putin.U.S. officials have warned that Russia's attempts to undermine U.S. elections could be directed by the Kremlin in ways to ensure that the results do not favor legitimate candidates.
The first person I mentioned the topic to is a former police officer from Ohio and he told me, "Don't go there", and it wasn't the first time that's come up. I also told him he's on the right track, about the police mentality of being in situations they're "supposed" to handle.We have an average of 15 officers killed by criminals every year in America. I'm going to quote some statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and from the National Institute of Justice that are relevant here:The average annual number of homicides that police officers reported to criminal justice departments fell from 3,078 in 1992, to 2,723 in 1999, to 2,500 in 2002, to 2,100 in the current year.The average annual number of officers killed by suspects is 16.4. The annual number of assaults on officers is about 100 as well. So, over 16 homicides and about 100 assaults over a 16 year period the average annual number of crime that officers report to police departments is approximately 10% less than the number of people who are violently killed by criminals.The average annual number of officer-victims is 0.14% of all police-casualties. The population of the entire United States is about 310 million people. So, you'd expect a crime rate of 1 per 100,0000 to happen once every few years, so the average annual number of police-casualties as police is 3.4 per 100,000 (which would put it in the same ballpark as the population – assuming 1 per 100,000 is about normal).So, the average year that an officer is shot by a criminal is……one-third more likely to occur in a state with a lower rate of gun ownership and 2.5 times more likely in a state with a higher rate.The average year an officer is killed in the line of duty is……four-and-a-half times more likely to occur in a state with a lower rate of gun ownership and twice as many times as many as in a state with a higher rate of gun ownership.So, there's certainly some reason to question the "gun culture" in certain states and that gun culture may be contributing to those numbers and certainly we can't discount how it may be driving up the number of officer-shootings. But I believe the real issue is that the attitude we have towards law enforcement is a product of an extremely complex mix of factors that I feel like we can't simply pinpoint to just either guns or police. We can't just blame guns or police for any of this in any way shape or form.So, for starters, let's look back at the gun culture and some specific gun culture things that some people may have in common, specifically in the areas where there are more crimes to be dealt with and people who need to be dealt with with those crimes.There's nothing wrong with saying that having more guns in a neighborhood is going to make a neighborhood safer. And, in some areas we've seen that is demonstrably true. I will state that I'm a gun owner and I am a gun owner for a reason, which is to protect my family.But, there are aspects to that gun culture that just do not seem to have a lot of bearing on crime rates, or officer-casualties for that matter – the specific type of firearm used in criminal activity and how it's used to effect the people being caught by officer-s. The only thing we tend to focus on is the gun. In fact, the gun might be the only thing we focus on. In order for a criminal to be convicted of a crime, there needs to be evidence against the person – something that usually means the type of evidence that includes the presence of a gun.While firearms are definitely necessary for crime to take place, they are certainly not the cause of crime or how it happens. There is no simple correlation between the type of firearm in a neighborhood, whether it's legal or not, and how that affects crime rates.There are certain things, in my opinion, that our attitudes towards law enforcement are just as much driven by the criminal justice system as they are by guns or anything else.First, the notion of "getting the guy on the ground." If he has a gun on him then that can go one of two ways: 1) He doesn't have to shoot you at all. Or 2) He needs more help to subdue you. While I'm all for using deadly force to detain and render aid to an officer-suspect who's armed with firearms, you have to remember that officers don't have to use force to subdue you. This is why the use of non-deadly force is such as effective tool. It's not that they have to shoot you at all, they need to make you stop shooting at them. It's because if
The former director of the United Nations Convention Against Torture, Juan E. Méndez, died Wednesday and will be buried in La Haunteria, a tiny town just outside his native El Salvador.A long-time human rights activist, Mr. Méndez spent 15 years working for the International Court of Justice in The Hague, where he was deputy secretary-general, a top position in the court that adjudicates disputes among nations. In 1989, the Supreme Court of Costa Rica rejected Mr. Méndez's attempt to remove himself as the top official at the court and forced him to move to Geneva.But he returned to El Salvador in 2000, when he was appointed as secretary of state of the Central American Court, according to an article he had authored for Inter Press Service. When he was nominated by President Salvador Sánchez Cerén in 2005, Mr. Méndez was asked how he was going to reconcile his new position as the secretary-general of a regional court with his commitment to defending human rights at the International Criminal Court in The Hague."I will continue to do that throughout my life," Mr. Méndez said. "So I will not resign, but I will resign from this post and put an end to my work."When Mr. Méndez made that announcement, he also noted that there were about 60 other lawyers working in Nicaragua, Cuba, Mexico, the Dominican Republic and the United States who could have been appointed and could have fulfilled the post he held. Instead, he said, the United States "will need to take responsibility, to act and be responsible." Mr. Méndez was referring to the American effort to prosecute senior officials for aiding and abetting human rights violators from the Salvadoran government during the civil war.
Greetings Pioneers!We're still continuing the improvements to the in-game economy, the majority of which revolves around the introduction of a new item system: Supply Crates. We've already introduced an item system in the game with the first item, the PIP (Precision Interface), and we have a lot more coming for future in-game supplies!We also created and put into the game a new way to obtain, craft and use Supply Crates. You can now build up a Supply Crate and keep it stocked with resources or build your own supply crates from scrap. You can combine items, such as crafting components from each other to create new items. It is a little bit advanced, although we understand the initial learning curve!

The last time we saw the San Francisco 49ers play in the playoffs, they fell to the Chicago Bears in overtime in a game that was far closer than it appeared at the time. The 49ers lost quarterback Colin Kaepernick to a broken thumb earlier in the game and their season was over. Now, after sweeping their divisional rivals at the halfway mark of the season, the 49ers have the chance to become NFC champs with a win on Saturday and a victory on Sunday. Let's take a look at the biggest storylines heading into the game.Who's Playing?After making some roster changes, including trading for quarterback Aaron Rodgers and drafting quarterback C.J. Beathard, the 49ers have a roster that looks to be one of, if not the deepest ever. On offence, they have the most talented players of their young careers on their side and will need every player to step up. On defence, they have a rookie like Eli Harold who is expected to start at the SAM linebacker spot. Harold's game tape isn't as impressive as his stats would suggest so you have to imagine he'll be given a lot of repetitions over the first couple of weeks of the season.Key Players to Look Out ForOn the defensive side, they have one of the most underrated defensive lines in the NFL. They also have one of the most explosive pass rushing duos in the NFL in Watt and Bruce Irvin. It'll be interesting to see whether or not Watt gets to the quarterback or if Irvin is able to use his speed to get to the quarterback. They can also expect to see Aldon Smith on the field in a lot of pass rushing situations. He has a knack for getting to the quarterback, but like all second year players is still developing.PredictionIt is hard to predict how the 49ers will play when they take the field on Saturday, but I think they'll be competitive (especially if Kaepernick isn't on the field). It is also going to be interesting to see if Kaepernick can lead them to victory or if the Bears' defense is able to hold them off. As for the Bears, they may be ready to make a comeback, but they still need to show up Saturday and get some work in before facing the Packers after playing the Giants.
Pizza HutA post shared by Nick & Matt M (@nicholasmattnck) on Jul 19, 2018 at 11:32am PDTWhat do you really get for $5? A bunch of toppings and small crust. Or at least a crust that's easy to peel. In an effort to make their pizza the biggest, best, greasiest, crème-de-la-crème, Pizza Hut has partnered with Baskin Robbins to create the world's first "Big Slice" — for the uninitiated, a slice that is twice as big as an average crust. On top of that, they're offering four different styles, including a classic, cheesy style, a pepperoni and mushroom style, and even a spicy, Asian-spiced style that's sure to please just about anyone. And who doesn't dream of the perfect slice of pizza — a gigantic and cheesy slice — of all things.Baskin RobbinsA post shared by Aiden Hirsch (@aiderhirsch) on Nov 4, 2017 at 9:28pm PSTYou won't find any pizza at Baskin Robbins' restaurants; they have limited selection in stores and take home deliveries. But you'll find tons of people trying to eat every last bite of the menu. Baskin Robbins created its first pizza after realizing there was no place to eat pizza at its other locations. According to the Baskin Robbins press release, the decision came after a number of customers "enjoyed the great taste and texture of a pizza but that could never find a place to eat it." Baskin Robbins began to experiment with different toppings and came up with the name "Baskin" for the brand.T-MobileA post shared by T-Mobile (@tmobile) on Jan 20, 2017 at 7:01am PSTThe giant telco known for its big screens and cheap plans has made pizza a way for its customers to pay it forward for donations via their "T-Mobile Pizza Party." Every T-Mobile user is entitled to a custom-designed pizza made for them by a local vendor and given to a homeless person or a needy family member in their community. The company has said that the company will pay each volunteer $1 of the pizza's value, and each time the pizza finds its way to a good home, volunteers will receive a $1.01 in donations.Bakery RoyaleA post shared by @bakeryroyal on Feb 8, 2017 at 4:33pm PSTIf you like your pizzas thicker and a bit more doughy from a pastry shop, try one of these restaurants. They'll make custom-made and custom-sized pizzas that range from 10 to 18 inches in diameter and are filled with either meat, cheese, or mushrooms. And it isn't just a matter of going to the store; you'll need to download your order to some device. You'll be able to keep track of what type of pizza is available to purchase, and when, too. And if you're planning on going to the site to place an order, make sure you leave some time to do so.Applebee'sA post shared by Steve Aoki (@steveaoki) on Sep 28, 2015 at 12:15am PDTNo matter what your experience with the idea of the "perfect" pizza, there are many to consider when going out for one. Whether you're looking to make a special meal for a group of people, or just need some pizzas to share with the rest of your family, you'll find many food service options at Applebees. If you're more on the "go with the flow" side of things and don't mind waiting a while to enjoy your pizzas, you could try the classic Italian style. Or, if you'd rather, try a cheese and tomato pizza. And if you're more into making your own pizza than eating it the way it's supposed to be eaten, check out these apps for iPhone and Android.
It has been reported that the British government is set to offer a cash reward of up to £75,000 for information leading to the arrest of the man who took part in the "worst incident" of a hate crime on British soil last year, the BBC has reported.The offer to help fund the arrest of the man behind the attack on Saffron Walden school in Rochdale was first reported by the BBC on Friday.A source said that the reward offered by the Home Office was likely to be substantial, adding that it "took some time" to reach a decision on the amount of the reward.The reward will be part of £50,000 offered by Scotland Yard for information leading to Saffron Walden killer Abid Saddique's arrest.Saddique had a short trial and was found guilty at a retrial on Wednesday for the attack on March 9 last year, in which Saffron Walden secondary school student Yasmin Alibhai-Brown sustained a series of painful injuries.A senior Home Office source had previously told the BBC that a cash reward had been suggested by the government, and it had been passed on by the home secretary.Scotland Yard had reportedly rejected £10,000 in offers from a number of individuals, but was said to have decided on the money sum after a meeting last week with representatives from the Rochdale Safeguarding Children Board, which oversees school incidents on grounds of race.Police and politicians have been in the hot seat following the attack, in which Saddique had been out with friends, and the lack of security measures at the school.The Rochdale mayor, Rishi Jai Hindley, was quoted at the time describing the attack, which was committed after an alcohol-fuelled row, as "horrible" and a "truly horrific crime". He later stepped down, sparking concern over how the incident was handled.
If any one piece on this website has been of use to your guitar playing, please feel free to leave a comment and I will check it out for inclusion. This is the only site to feature original, original articles on the top twelve best guitar technique secrets ever. Here they are…It's all about the fretboard!Just about every single one of us here at Guitar Player has struggled with this one one day, every one of us. Whether it's the technique of picking a note in a tune, how to pick a chord, or how to play through two songs, fretboard technique is a matter of life or death when playing a lead guitar.The fretboard is our most precious resource and we must always remember that. Even if no one else is on your guitar we should all take note of how our fretboard looks and feel by using every bit of our guitar budget and effort to ensure that the look and feel remain consistent. This lesson has been on my long list for some time, now I want to put it all together.Fretboard BasicsHere are the basics of the fretboard, what you want it to look like and the importance of learning to recognise them (in the right places).Start by holding your finger at the 6th fret where the first fret is.Now move your finger up to the 9th fret where the second fret is located (2nd fret is slightly below where the first fret is).Now move your finger down to the 6th fret of the 12th fret where the third fret is.That's 1-6-9-6-9!The fretboard looks like this:If your fingerboard has any gaps in it, like if you started at one and then moved to another, you have made a misplacement which means that it was placed one fret too high.The bottom two frets where your finger is currently positioned and the top two frets where your finger was moved are therefore different!That's what frets are. Each fret is a separate location on the guitar, the three octaves of notes run from the 6th fret down to the 12th fret (the octaves are all different)The top two frets are the most important frets on the fretboard – the first fret is where you play most of the notes you'd want to, the second fret is where many common notes are held. Therefore you would set the top two frets at the same fret levels as the rest of the guitar, this ensures that we don't get any unwanted frequencies that may distract us from what we're trying to do here at the fretboard.So there are 3 frets, two are on the top two fretboard and two are on the bottom two frets. All frets are the same height and all the same distances apart which is why they are called frets. All guitar strings have a pitch, called pitch which is determined by the way you pick. The higher the pitch, the sharper the sound. The lower pitch, the softer the sound. Pick with your pointer finger, (which is at the 3rd fret), on the string nearest the frets, and pick a little higher than the pointer, (which is at the 7th fret).With this, you can already see the key point to knowing which finger is playing what because each finger acts as a bar across all the other fingers. The two frets on the bottom are one row, the one closest to the bottom (i.e. just two frets away) the other side is three rows down. All three frets are the same height and they are spaced 3 frets apart.For example if you were to play the first fret of the seventh chord, C, with your index finger only on a string and your pinky on a string and then your third fret which is at the 12th fret, these frets would form one row (row 1). The other row is a half step of the one above it (row 2), this means that it is one fret and six frets above the one on which your index finger is (row 1).The frets in between these would be considered a quarter step or two frets lower. The frets on the top are four frets apart (row 3) and so on.What you should want the pitch of your fingerboard to be is the lowest note you can play with it (without moving your index finger). So if you were to hold that note on your 6th fret and played the next note, F, at the 7th fret on the same guitar it would sound the same. It would also be easy to use as a reference point for determining which pitch is which (if you'd want to hold notes one octave apart).Now this is all well and good but what makes it useful is that as you get older, or
Sitting by his cot in a hotel room for a story in the November 2000 issue of Men's Journal, then-editor Bill McMorris wrote an editorial arguing that the sexual revolution was a myth."The truth is that we live far more in the past than the future," he wrote. "One big reason is that, for the majority of us, sex hasn't changed at all in 60 years."McMorris's story was not meant to be a repudiation of all that people like McMorris believed on the subject of sex. If anything, it was a confirmation of the myth, a way of making the reader more comfortable in saying "sex was basically the same throughout human history" and letting the "hippies" off the hook.It wasn't meant to be taken literally, either. "The '60s were the most sexed generation ever," McMorris wrote.In other words, if McMorris is to be believed, the sexual revolution was all a lie.Well, yes. It is indeed what you thought it was, and McMorris did not tell the article's reporter, a man named Robert Evans, this. "It was just supposed to be funny to write this article," he said.McMorris, a 55-year-old father of three, is a man who has tried to tell the truth about sex before. A few days ago, while in Chicago for the annual meeting of the American Association of Massage Therapists, he wrote a column for the Wall Street news site MarketWatch about sex and marriage. He said he was surprised at how his column was greeted: "The negative, 'What's the use of this column if you're not gonna write a joke?'"When he first started writing about sex, he wrote on Quora, a question and answer site, about a story he covered about a doctor who decided to retire at a young age because he couldn't stand the way the sex in his office was changing. He was also upset by a story he did in 2000 about teenage boys who had sex with their girlfriends, and how his editor told him in another column "you can't tell me the truth.""People want to believe that if they're not doing it, or don't do it, then it's impossible to have anything bad happen to them or to their bodies," he told the Chicago Sun-Times recently. "They don't want to learn that there are things out there that are a lot more benign than what we're taught, and that I mean things far less benign than what we're taught."McMorris, who used to be a writer for Men's Journal back in the 1980s, began getting requests for interviews about his sex life nearly 20 years ago. He'd never written a big-deal column on the topic, nor even a big-deal piece in Men's Magazine in the early 1990s. Then he was offered a story for Men's Journal's November print issue, a story that focused a little more on sex and a little less just about sex. McMorris began thinking he might be the man to give the topic a full-blown, magazine-quality editorial treatment.To do so, he needed a bit of editorial help. One day in 2000, he and his wife, Jennifer, went to a New York City massage parlor. (Jennifer, a former fashion model from London, asked her husband. They ended up hiring the same masseuse, who later told the couple that the client she thought was her was actually someone else who was wearing his wife's clothes.) He was not interested in writing a column, but as she read the script, she began giggling. "It's like it's a bad dream I'm having," she said.

The latest in a long history of great comic movies follows a high school nerd (Sophie Turner) who gets sucked into the world of superheroes and becomes their first-ever recruit.In 2016, it is hard to imagine a superhero movie that could have come along to replace the box office juggernaut that is the Avengers. There were a handful of films in this genre in the early 90s, but none of them lived up to the standard set by the Avengers in terms of the quality of the story, the cast, and the action. Yet that's exactly what we got in this year's Wonder Woman.Director Patty Jenkins and starring Gal Gadot (Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, Wonder Woman) deliver what amounts to a modern take on the Greek myth, that is, the myth that created the first female superhero known in the modern continuity of DC Comics.We start with the origin of Diana Prince (Sophie Turner) and the love triangle that ensues. Diana is the former love interest of Steve Trevor (Chris Pine), the pilot of the Flying Wing, which was one of many planes that landed on a beach under a mysterious power outage. Diana is a fierce warrior who is a member of the Amazon tribe.We then jump forward to 1992, and the superhero world has undergone a revolution with two new titles, Superman and Batman, and the "New 52" relaunch. Two new series, Aquaman and Wonder Woman (now called Justice League), have also been created, and as you could imagine, both have a heavy focus on the women on the team with the addition of Wonder Woman's Steve Trevor.Aquaman is the main protagonist of the story as he is the prince who will become the next king of Atlantis. When he learns that his father, King Tut, has died, he takes Aquaman under his wing to keep the throne of the underwater kingdom.Steve Trevor is the first recruit for the Justice League who would become a superhero in the Justice League book, also featuring Batman, The Flash, Green Lantern, and Superman. With the introduction of Wonder Woman (Gadot, playing the role of Queen Hippolyta), the League of Justice are in need of more hands to guide their crusade against villains who seek to destroy mankind. Steve and Diana are the first two people chosen, although they are never named as members of the Justice League. With Steve Trevor now in the team, the team begins to find the rest of the league.While the movie is set in the real world, it's important to realize that the story is fantasy, and that the entire experience is an illusion. The characters of Wonder Woman and Aquaman are created just for the films, but they have no real life counterparts. In fact, the actual movie takes place in a future parallel to today. The movie follows Diana Prince as she works at an oceanarium, in a world where women fight crime.Wonder Woman has long been one of the most popular female superheroes of all time. She's the first female superhero to have a direct connection to her source material in comics, and she is known for fighting in armor which is far different than the traditional "Wonder Woman" costume. In DC comics, Diana fights at the behest of the gods. In these film, she is more like a modern day Wonder Woman.Though the movie's theme is "fantasy," it does have a few real-world connections.The movie opens with one of the greatest sequences of CGI ever created. This shot is reminiscent of a scene from the second movie, The Dark Knight, where a massive meteor crashes down from the heavens. The meteor's impact hits the ground where Superman is protecting Bruce Wayne (Adam West).The two heroes jump into action as the crowd rushes to help. They run back down the mountain, a massive fire breaks out in the distance, and the Justice League has found a way to send a powerful signal out to the rest of the world. This scene takes place in 2017, which is after the movie's release in theaters. The people of the world have already seen Wonder Woman, so they believe them as a hero when they're actually a threat.Wonder Woman is also at war against Ares who is a god of war, which also happens to be her father.The movie's final confrontation, or more the battle of the Gods, involves two sides. The gods, led by Ares, are trying to destroy the world for good. It's a story that echoes the movie The Avengers, where The Gods are the villains in the Marvel universe.The battle between Zeus (Russell Crowe) and Ares begins with an attempt to kill Zeus. Ares is enraged that the man who created the gods, Poseidon (Brian Cox), does not exist anymore. Ares then kills Zeus, and attempts to kill Ares with a bolt of lightning. To save Ares, Diana Prince takes the shot, and it knocks Ares into the depths of Hades, and destroys
The last time I was asked to speak at a local event was at a high school graduation, but my friend's mother had arranged for me to go and give the speech. I went. I was nervous because this is a topic that is close to my heart. I knew it was controversial for certain readers; however, it's something that a lot of parents and individuals should ponder and reconsider as you consider whether or not their children should hear about homosexuality in the church.The topic of "sexual orientation" in the church isn't a topic that's going to be going away anytime soon. The fact of the matter is, people are dying. It's not just in your heart that you have to deal with the same thing that people all over the world are dealing with, but that's how it is throughout all times and places.I am a practicing Christian. I am also a father. I have two daughters. I have friends who are gay. I support them. You can believe all of that. But let's be honest at this point, most of my friends are Christian and they also have gay children. There will always be that issue in that circle. And this is simply not going anywhere, as long as there is a church that can say, "You have sinned."Now, I realize that my friend's mother was only looking out for her family, and she was only looking for a safe environment for her children in which to learn about the truth of the gospel. So, let's not call into question her decision for the way that she conducted the event. The fact of the matter is, you don't know what life is going to be like for your kids. Some people come out as gay during their teenage years, and then never come out again. Or at least, that's what we were told through media and from stories that we could read. And that was what we were used to. That's why we didn't question why our friend's mother was so concerned. Because that's how it is for everyone, so when you hear a gay person speaking about the church, you have to think about what it's going to be like for you and your kids.There are a lot of different things that may go on in their life that is going to determine which direction they're going. What do you feed them? Do you put too much emphasis on academics? Do you put too much emphasis on sports? What's going to be your favorite activity? So how do you go about giving them the best life possible, and you have no idea where that's going to lead you?That's why being part of a school, whether it be a Catholic school, or Baptist school, or Presbyterian school, or any private school you want to go to, is so important. They give your child all of the opportunities in life to discover who they are, where they're going and who and what they have to offer to society.If they are told and reinforced from their youth and up that you can be gay at times or you can have gay friends or family members, as long as you keep your head down, keep your mouth shut and don't let anyone know about it, it won't hurt your kids. It won't hurt their grades. It won't hurt anything that they're experiencing in the Church. And if it does happen in your life, try your best to forgive them and not turn them over to a very nasty side. That side of society is very sad, very vile, very hateful.The reality is, that every once in a while, you have these issues that come up. It happens. But that's where we're at. And no matter how much the church tries to "save" you and keep you out, you are in a vulnerable position. You are vulnerable because there is going to be a time in your life when you'll either choose to go that dark place or not. And when you do choose to take that path, they will be there, and it will destroy everything that's good that you have. The one thing that's going to matter in the end is what you love you for.You can love a gay son or daughter. You can love someone because of who they are, not because of what they look like, not because of what they do, not even because of how they choose to live life. You can love because of the person that they are. You can love someone because of where they are headed and you don't need to tell them because it's already going to be there. That's where you have to give all of God's love to your beloved children and loved ones.I just felt that my friend's mother was being a little bit judgmental. She was using the same reasoning that many churches do in our society: "If you have a gay person, they're just going to lead other kids into sin and sin will lead to homosexuality." It was wrong. It was wrong for me
Gone Fishing's "Honey" series has always been about the story behind that title. Here we'll take a step into the future and take on the story behind the title that went out under the other name, Honey 2!From Aichi to TokyoWhile we have been talking honey, how about I tell you a bit more about the country from which that name comes.At this time, the land of Aichi was known as "Dawn's Glory" due to the amount of wealth it brought forth, which soon started to decline after the "great fire", the biggest fire in Japan's history.While the area around Tokyo (which is known as "Minato-ku") became the "main hub" for trade due to being located close to the sea (the port of Kobe), Aichi remained relatively poor.Around this time, there was a small-time farmer from Minato-ku, Fukasawa Takatsuka, who went to Tokyo to find a job, but was left alone and homeless by the local police due to the lack of jobs in the area.When this farmer found work in a bakery in the "Ginza" district, this was where he met a beautiful woman who, much like him, was homeless, and helped her settle in Tokyo.A little while after this, Fukasawa Takatsuka was also killed by thieves who attempted to steal the sweets he was selling at an arcade. Not too much later, this death sparked a series of events that would come to be known as Aichi-ku's "Honey Wars" (although Honey Wars is also loosely associated to Takatsuka by later references).After the honey wars, Aichi was officially renamed to "Honey 2" (hence "Honey 2," meaning "one who has been defeated") when its local government was forced into taking over the city from another "honey wars" fighting faction.It wouldn't be too long until the Japanese people would also take notice of the strange honey that was being made in Aichi, and the honey that eventually made it to America.(To be continued...)
The Canadian PressOTTAWA -- A Conservative MP who wrote about how his daughter experienced domestic violence says a Liberal attack on an Alberta judge is another example of the Liberals targeting the judicial system.Nathan Cullen says Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould's recent statement criticizing an Alberta judge for a tweet defending a convicted killer is "just the latest example where members of the Liberal bench have been tarred with the same brush" by Ms. Wilson-Raybould.Last week, the minister said a tweet posted by Justice Paul Belanger from his personal Twitter account was in poor taste and could give people the wrong idea about the judiciary.Ms. Wilson-Raybould says she hopes there's no place in the judicial system for "political attacks.""You can't have an opposition party on the government side of the house that is doing this," she told reporters Tuesday.The justice ministry was made aware of the tweet by a newspaper after the lawyer for the family of Ryan Muth, who was convicted of manslaughter, wrote about it on his client's behalf.The lawyer says he has received a number of positive responses to his tweet, and the judge's tweet is the only Twitter comment that matters, because it is public.Ms. Wilson-Raybould says the Liberals want to change the way the justice system operates, but if they do, then it will be up to Parliament to do it."So the minister said, as I said yesterday, it's completely unacceptable, and if anybody is concerned about that or doesn't support that kind of attitude, then they should speak up and be supportive of any changes that may be made."Last week, the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, said that the judge's tweets show that he did not "understand the gravity" of the situation that made Ryan Muth's family lose a son.The MP for Skeena, B.C., spoke out about Ryan's death last week when the Crown was seeking a sentence of life without parole.Last week, Ms. Wilson-Raybould said the judge's tweet, which was posted days before a hearing for Muth on the manslaughter charge, could cause Canadians to have prejudiced views of the judiciary.With files from the Canadian PressLike Us On FacebookAlso on HuffPost
The latest issue of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACA) Freedom of Information Act lawsuit against the federal government reveals that the State Department's "Global Engagement Center" (GEC) has been collecting biographical data from American citizen political activists from several countries. For instance, as part of an anti-Iranian campaign, the GEC received information that was collected from more than 15,000 U.S. citizens for a 2010-2013 project named "Sophia."The project was "an attempt by the United States government to use the tools of global engagement and counterterrorism to disrupt the activities and leadership of foreign terrorist organizations, including al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). … [T]he system includes biographical and biometric information of individuals — the first in-depth analysis of the collection of biometric data — from countries throughout the world, whose participation is voluntary."As Glenn Greenwald puts it,That is a lot of data.And that is not all.In addition to collecting some biographical data, GAO found, the project created an "informal" terrorism watch list, as well as an "exchange database." In effect, the information gathered was "maintained indefinitely." It has been speculated that "Sophia" and the exchange database were created to "track" suspected jihadists, a practice that the Obama administration says it has stopped. The State Department, who were the only ones in possession of the data, claimed that the project was not the work of the agency.Despite having not been started under Obama, the GEC was created in 2007 under the Bush administration under the auspices of the "Global Threat and Terrorism" program. However, in January 2012, a Bush-era appointee, David Cohen, the Director of the Counterterrorism Center (CTC) at the CTC, took over the project. Prior to Cohen taking over, George Little of the CTC resigned. Obama later picked Cohen to be the Director of the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC).Despite the apparent lack of concern that it might implicate Americans, the ACLU was nonetheless able to obtain the project's budget.The State Department, in response to the lawsuit on March 7th, released a statement regarding the GEC.The GEC is a component of the State Department's global engagement campaign whose purpose is to help foreign governments develop and implement anti-terrorism and foreign anti-corruption approaches, while addressing humanitarian and civic issues. The primary target audience for the GEC is foreign governments, not U.S. citizens in the foreign countries participating in the GEC. This includes both government officials and private companies from all over the world interested in working with State on international cooperation.The release reads in its entirety:
SOUTHERN BORDERE: Tired of being treated like second-rate tourists by many locals who think there are better countries in the world, the British tourist group is set to launch a tour at Kano, the African capital that has more than 10 million tourists a year.The five-day Kano-Cairo tour, to be launched next month, will have a focus on Africa's ancient ruins and wildlife.The group aims to promote the benefits of travel, through cultural experiences and education, while bringing the two largest cities together.Tour guides will have a "huge advantage" over travellers from the rest of the world because they can draw on vast experience from their African travels.Dr Tim Williams, of the Kano-Cairo Tour Organisation that has been running the Kano-Cairo tour since 2001, said: "This will be a great way of encouraging people back to Africa and connecting with the culture and history."Tourists are constantly told that the rest of Africa is nothing but rubbish and we want to prove them wrong."They will see how great and beautiful Nigeria is. People will appreciate the experience."The Kano-Cairo tour currently covers one month and costs around £1,500. Tourists are taken mainly to the Kano and Gombe temples in its north-eastern outskirts, to the UNESCO World Heritage site of the Bamiyan Buddhas, and to the famed Kano Mosque. They will visit the capital's many historic districts and sites, some of them closed to the public for security reasons.Visitors who sign up for the tour will have access to hotels at no extra cost and there will be a focus on cultural experiences, including a visit to the Kano Museum of History and the Kano Cathedral, as well as traditional singing and dancing.
For the first time, scientists have successfully tested the "molecular scissors" that could allow them to reshape or even replace individual genes in living cells, marking a significant advance toward engineering new, effective treatments for some genetic diseases.The scientists at Harvard University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology, writing in Nature today, said that by combining CRISPR with a protein-cutting enzyme called Cas9, they could easily and consistently remove and replace single genes without the need for the complicated molecular scissors previously used to cut DNA."The genome is a book of thousands of genetic instructions," said senior author Emmanuelle Charpentier, a professor of biology at Harvard, who led the research with her former doctoral students David Liu, now at Columbia University; Jennifer Doudna, now at the University of California, Berkeley; and Emmanuelle Charpentier, the Charles Knight Professor of Biology at MIT. "With the molecular scissors, you can easily cut a single gene, but this is never done on a real-time basis."This development marks the first time that the team has performed genome editing with a single gene. Previous experiments—which have been made possible by CRISPR's ability to precisely edit and replace multiple genes at a time—have mostly used single genes at a time.The work could pave the way for the discovery of new types of therapies, such as those designed to repair or replace genes or even cancer drugs that interfere with or disrupt natural genetic functions.The research group's "immortal technique" could potentially allow CRISPR to edit not just the genes of a cancer cell, but any other type of genome."It has really broad implications when applied to any kind of genome," Charpentier said. "It's something that, for the first time, allows you to edit not just one gene in one cell, but any other genome."A major bottleneck for research on genetic therapies lies in how easy it is to modify a target genome. By contrast, the paper's lead author, Doudna, said the "immortal technique" is already being used for research on cancer, as well as on genetic diseases such as sickle-cell anemia."For us, what's exciting is this approach works for any disease in which the mutation can be shown to contribute to the disease," Doudna said. That includes cancers, as well as neurological and skin diseases, which typically have mutations in multiple genes that contribute to the severity of symptoms, even on a genetic level.That makes this new discovery more than just another tool to help scientists in their field. It also opens up a way for scientists to learn more about what makes certain diseases, such as Huntington's disease and autism—a genetic disorder—difficult to treat and even deadly.Doudna's mother, Joan, a Harvard scientist and professor emerita, contributed to the new paper.For the research team, "immortality" is an important concept in which a system becomes so effective that it can effectively repair disease-causing mutations. That's something that would never have been possible with earlier methods, Charpentier said, because they were too slow.The immortal approach works by allowing cells to survive in the laboratory without DNA replication, which would cause them to eventually die.That allows researchers to "tinker" with individual genes in a living person. It also makes it possible to test the "immortal" approach in cells that would not normally survive cell proliferation and death in the human body.There remains much work to be done before the new technique can be safely and effectively used. The researchers hope to start clinical trials of their immortal technique as soon as possible, though they caution that even these early studies will likely use an enzyme called DNA polymerase as their cutting tool. There's no other method commonly used in cell biology to remove or replace single genes."This has been a long time coming, but we're not out of the woods yet," Liu said.The next step for scientists, Charpentier and the other co-authors wrote, is to figure out ways to replace the entire cut and replace genes with new ones—a process that is not yet thought to be possible with the technique.In particular, the scientists have had difficulty getting Cas9 to cut a DNA sequence that does not code for a protein in the genome. That's because Cas9, like the two molecules it resembles, is made of a single protein called CRISPR. When the molecular scissors were first discovered in 2010, the researchers assumed that Cas9 must function as a protein-cutting enzyme. But they now know that there are several possible explanations to why Cas9 doesn't cut, among them the enzyme's ability to use multiple proteins; if the two molecules are different sizes; the presence of an off-target effect in the target sequence; and the difficulty of finding and removing other proteins that, in the case of Cas9,

A Texas woman who allegedly told her 14-year-old daughter that she wanted to be a sex worker after they had sex because she "didn't want to get pregnant" was a "sexually sick human being" who should have never been allowed in the first place, a Houston prosecutor said Tuesday.As KPRC reported in February, Cynthia Ward, 39, was accused of telling her daughter, who is seven years old, that she wanted to be a sex worker because she didn't want to "get pregnant." Ward's trial for alleged child molestation also heard testimony that her daughter had told the younger teen how much she wanted to work in the adult entertainment industry in order to make money to pay for college when she grows up, according to the Houston Chronicle.Now Judge John Hurley said the testimony provided enough evidence to conclude that Ward, who faces charges of sexual assault of a child under 14, acted with "reckless disregard" for the truth. The victim also told the court that as a result of the incident, she suffered "post-traumatic stress disorder" for years after the alleged incident, the Chronicle reported.But Hurley also said the trial also highlighted the importance of parental consent for such matters, as he pointed to the case of one of his own daughters, which resulted in manslaughter charges being sought against a young man charged with killing her."No parent wants to have an issue arise with a child that they cannot control, whether it involves a child who needs help, or whether it involves a child that has to be restrained," the judge said. "The law is there for those situations, and the responsibility is that you must do everything that you can to keep those situations out of those situations."District Attorney Devon Anderson said she is grateful for Ward's apparent willingness to admit her crimes and also has expressed the hope that her plea deal will put an end to what she called a "horrendous case.""It's a relief to have her face the music on these charges," Anderson said during Tuesday's hearing.
Kathleen Burchill (Photo: Special to The Clarion-Ledger)In the past two years, the New Orleans City Council has changed its mind at least six times in regard to a controversial development near Lakeview Elementary. And it's not even close among its council members and the mayor.In fact, just two council members voted against a contract proposal from a consultant that would have been a major help to the school's future – the city's chief development officer, Bill Smith.So far, though, in a city where public officials repeatedly find new ways to delay or block a project, it wasn't the first time there were delays with Smith's contract for the school facility."I never thought in my lifetime that a developer would be able to get better than city approval as far as the design is concerned," said Councilwoman Mary Margaret Oliver, D-Echo Park.After consulting the city's Code of Federal Regulations for the contract, an official with the city Department of Community Affairs, which handles contract reviews, found Smith's proposal of nearly $2 million less for improvements to the Lakeview Elementary School than the consultant's initial bid was acceptable.But the city's Office of School Construction, which oversees all of the city's school construction, denied the contract because it didn't meet the requirements for a "development contract," the kind that the city usually requires. Smith and the city didn't respond to questions.But if the city's Office of School Construction had given the contract approval, the Lakeview Elementary School would have been able to move forward even sooner with its long-delayed renovation as it continued to try to meet all of the milestones that state law requires for the building.At Lakeview Elementary School, the project's first phase – an expansion of two years – was finally completed last year and has been the center of more than two years' debate between the city school board and the New Orleans Mayor's Office for School Improvement, which oversees construction of all of the city's schools.It began with the city's school board asking NOMI for a study as soon as 2013 of how to fund improvements to the building for nearly four decades. The school board did so in order to have its hands on some revenue that it could use to help fund the improvements. It later turned that request over to the city's Office of School Construction, which in turn submitted a proposal to the city's contract commission for review.The contract commission last year said the $1.4 million Smith had requested for the original request was acceptable and approved the contract on behalf of Smith's proposal. But Oliver said he tried to meet the building's requirements for other upgrades, and some were rejected."I don't think Mr. Smith realized what his original request for $1.4 million for improvements were going to cost the school," said Oliver, pointing out that Smith also tried to meet building requirements on water filtration and emergency sprinkler systems. "I think the consultant was not very clear about why Mr. Smith didn't get what he wanted."A spokeswoman for the NOMI, Patricia Taylor, said it is too early to tell how the process went and that it is not necessary for the city to re-ask the contract commission for another review of its original decision.Smith, who represents East Jefferson Parish and is a partner in the consulting firm that provided the New Orleans City Council with the first draft of its initial proposal, says the city's Office of School Construction is being stubborn."I was able to get what I wanted, and now the people who signed off on it are unwilling to listen to the people of the school board or the public who voted for the proposal," said Smith.City Schools Superintendent Paul Rainey says Smith hasn't been consistent, only offering variations on where to line up money to complete the improvements on time.In its first report to the Board of Elementary and Secondary Education on the matter, the board made four requests for information – asking for a cost estimate for the project, a timeline for completion of the project, the type of project to be performed and to see documentation showing that other funding sources – whether from the NOMI or elsewhere – are available in case the district doesn't have the money to complete the project on time.And according to an evaluation of the board's requests and how the process was conducted, the board found that Smith failed in several areas, including in not including enough money for the project on his initial proposal.In order to meet the three additional requirements of the board's initial proposal, Smith ultimately sought $3.6 million in new funds from the city school district. He said the new funding came from the construction fund and not from the NOMI.Oliver said the new proposal is a far cry from Smith's initial proposals. She said that in Smith's first request to the NOMI, for instance, he
(ANSA) - Rome, July 8 - Police say three of four people held in a suspected kidnapping and rape case were detained early Tuesday, a day after the suspects escaped.Two have been questioned, and a third was still being interrogated, Col. Roberto De Paulo told a news conference, after some 1030 women and girls had arrived at Rome's Termini train station to register a complaint about being held.In late July, the body of a 16-year-old girl was found in the basement of the house where the suspects were staying.After a month-long investigation, police on Monday arrested a suspect who admitted to kidnapping and raping the girl. He was a resident of the house in the Carrera district that the victim attended.An accomplice of the suspect confessed to the crime. Two other suspects were arrested shortly before the suspects were released.A total of 16 girls and five boys aged between 14 and 19 say they were sexually abused over several months in 2012-2013.Authorities have not released any information about the suspects.
[NOTE: You'll need 2,000 XP to level-up your first character so be sure to collect it all before you start!]So you've got a cool new job, new ship, but you're ready to make the jump to open world! You've also got the best weapons and gear to make your travels more exciting and exciting than the most boring game ever made.Well, here is your solution. This guide will tell you how to level up as efficiently as possible starting with your first ship. But we'll also cover a few key tips for making the most of that time you have before you hit level-up with your first character.Level Up With Your First ShipSo, this is the one thing every PC RPG gamer should do at least once. Level-up with your first ship. I know this is kind of a big step to make, especially if you're used to the grind, but if you have a newbie character you should try this. I know there are more efficient ways to level your character, but this is a pretty easy and quick one.So what does this mean? Let me break it down.You start by gaining some XP per fight and XP from your equipment. You get this XP when you finish a fight.The first thing you want to do is open up the menu, select "Options" then you'll see the option from "XP Gains" menu. Click on the button with 3 vertical bars. After two seconds you can see the number of XP gained for your last fight.Repeat for every ship and every fight you do. You'll get to level 3 in about 25 fights. (Note, this is the XP for the ship and doesn't account for XP from your other equipment, weapons, and consumables etc.)Now, you should be very familiar with the menu options so you don't have to repeat this process. However, I think there is one thing I still need to explain here.When you do XP for a ship, your XP gain is based on the quality of an item. So a "medium" quality item will give you 6x the amount of XP as a "good" quality item and a "good" quality item will give you 18x the XP as a "medium" quality item. So don't think of your ship's XP as a currency you can earn. It's really the item itself, that gives you the most XP. If you don't want to use XP as your currency, try to sell the items you get from ship XP to the NPC who sells you the ship. That way, they can just convert your XP and give you credits.And what are the rest of those different XP and equipment options?There are many different options in there. You can do "XP Gains" (1x XP per fight), "Armor" (10xp for armor, 8xp for consumables and 9xp for weapons), "XP Gain" (1.2x for first fight with the same character), "Experience" (20xp from killing a monster, 15xp for completing an activity and 1xp for having a character level up). Some of the "XP" stats may change depending on what ship you choose and what kind of equipment you have. These will also change depending on the situation on the server. There are also two "Combat Options" under "Combat" menu.You get the choice between "Normal" mode or "Hard" mode. Normal mode is the same as normal level up. Only "Heavyweight" equipment is allowed but "Heavyweight" weapon can only deal 3.5x damage. The other option is "Hard Mode" which changes some stats to make them a lot more formidable. I'm not a fan of Hardcore mode so I choose Normal.If I start using heavy weapons during the day, I will get a very high damage bonus with my weapons. You should also pay attention to "XP Gain" stat in the main menu. If you start using very heavy weapons at night, you will have a bad time. You can't use your heavy weapons in night fighting style.It only takes a few minutes to get ready for your first day of adventuring. You will also come across many NPC merchants that will sell you equipment and consumables.When you're ready, make sure to buy equipment before you go to the next town. Some equipment is rare but many items are in high demand and will fetch a lot of money on day 2.Day 1 – 4x XPWhen you go to town at first you'll want to do some questing. There are many different quests in the game but the "First Contact" quest seems to be the most popular as you can get up to four XP per quest. You could go on with this quest, completing other quests and grinding for gold but it will add a few minutes to your day because you
It's finally here, the year's very first round of my Patreon-exclusive series, "The Return of the Living Dead." If you love zombie movies, I'm sure you'll love these. They're all in one book and they all come complete with my signature commentary and commentary-only podcasts as well as full-sized full-color illustrations by myself and some of the amazing artists who have lent their talent to this series thus far! There's even a "The Return of the Living Dead: Part 2" short story!The Return of the Living Dead: Volume 2 (Collector's Edition)Collector's Cover: A more detailed cover than the first version above.1st Vol 2:  Living Dead (Book 1)  This story takes place just after our survivors made it to their new world and I tell you, things get pretty bloody. There's also a very special cameo from the great and much younger Bruce Campbell, who did a ton of great voice acting for this film as the creepy, yet also kind, "Zombie Joe" that you'll hear in several parts of the book.This is truly the "Return of the Living Dead" you've been waiting for. It's that good."Living Dead" is a "zombie" horror anthology series from Mike Mignola Studios and Dark Horse Comics and the work of Frank Darabont. The series focuses on six individual tales of zombies, serial killers, and others of the undead that must fight to survive their end after human civilization has decimated them.  Mike is a huge fan of science fiction, so while the stories we're told are more science fiction inspired the tone of each story has a good deal of blood, guts, and gore.  To find more about the story, the characters, the graphic novel format, and more, go to mikemignola.com .  Click here for the complete series synopsis.
I have just returned from a short stay in the village of Eindhoven where the new national museum has opened its doors to the public. I was immediately struck by the lack of any significant evidence of the Viking Age in our town. The museum is situated on a small part of an ex-factory campus and the buildings where formerly housed the car industry. The streets have no signboards and there are little or no traces of Viking Age settlements. I do notice several items of historical significance like a Norse axe from about 1000 AD and an intact Viking sword. The museum is a good place to look at the local art and architecture and it is very well located. The museum has a lot of interesting exhibits and the exhibitions are well organized.The museum has a lot of interesting exhibits and the exhibits are well organized.The most interesting part is the archive housing over 2000 objects dating back to the Viking age. The museum was founded by the local municipality in 2003 as an exhibition centre but has now become a permanent place for the display of Viking-age objects. Visitors have a chance to examine a wide range of objects – jewelry, animal bones, pots and other artefacts. The museum also features two exhibition areas: the Viking hall and the 'Old world' hall. The 'Old world' hall features a small collection of artefacts that date from the Middle Ages.The Viking hall consists of an area dedicated to the exhibition of 'new world' objects whereas the Viking hall has a collection of over 2000 objects with a focus on 'old world' objects.I am now on my way back from Rotterdam and I will have more information about Eindhoven in the days to come. I was pleasantly surprised by the museum and I would love to visit again in the future when this little-known part of the Netherlands is in peak season for tourist.
The Supreme Court is taking up a case that could have a huge impact on Internet service providers by deciding whether it should intervene in an issue that has raged among consumers: whether they have the right to receive a fast lane or slow lane for the content they want.Just about every broadband customer in the United States gets their Internet connection from a cable or telephone provider — and the Supreme Court announced this week that it will hear the case of Verizon and Comcast.Those companies say they should be treated the same as every other company, so that, for instance, people on Verizon's video service won't have to wait 5 minutes between videos or Comcast doesn't have to make a business decision for people on the Internet.But opponents of the practice say the Internet was once open because it was open to any company. If a company wants to pay the big providers for an advantage in traffic than has to travel through the pipes, it should be able to do so.While the Supreme Court has heard cases in which it was asked to decide whether companies providing telecommunications services had to treat all websites equally or if each service provider had to treat a different set of websites like a separate utility, this case will be the first time it has decided on the issue of how much the government should enforce net neutrality rules.

We recently posted an article that talked about some of the best and worst players to play with over the years. This was primarily for new players to get used to the various ways to play that new characters can. For those that have been around for some time, however, the biggest problem with playing against such players can be the same issue that made them rise to become famous in the first place: bad decision-making.This article would be useless to those who have read that one, since you may already know that if you're getting stomped out of your lane or getting 1-shot in the jungle, it's probably because he/she made some bad decision which led to their demise. If not, then look no further for a list of the players who have made a name for themselves by making the most mistakes every game.10. The RudeThis guy can play the game of League at its absolute finest when he doesn't make any stupid mistakes. Not only is he able to make correct and intelligent decisions, he makes them fast, he executes them expertly, and he rarely gives a fuck. He's not going to be as popular as the rest of these players, but if he's still playing then it's very possible that he's going to be at the highest levels of competition.Rudeness does not equal smart. You'll notice that all of these players have very few positive comments about them on all of the forums (except perhaps Aery). These are not people who care. In fact, all of them just want to win because they don't care about what all of you think: "Well, at least you know that they're doing it wrong." They hate this game so much because every time it's played for them, it's not fun. You hear this every moment when you're playing League. This is why so many of them are either banned or never play at all, which means that many of us who watch/play this game are able to enjoy league with a fresh perspective for once in a long, long time.9. The UnoriginalSome of you may have already guessed that this guy is an unoriginal genius, but we're going to confirm it anyway: this guy is better than almost every single other champion in the game. He can outplay and outwitting almost everyone on his team. He's always in a winning position and he will usually win almost every game.The problem with him is that he does things that most other champions in the game couldn't do that he finds hilarious. However, his idea is actually really bad. It doesn't matter if he's going for a 3-man gank on a solo-bot lane where the enemy team barely has vision of him, he'll find a way to get the kills. He'll find a way to not die all the time because he has an ultimate that gives 1.6 seconds of invulnerability for every attack on him. He'll find a way to not get caught all the time by the enemy ADC or tank because they're all running their own damage abilities (unless they're Ashe). He'll find a way to get all the kills in a 1v2 because he can outplay other champions by playing to their weaknesses. He's so good at playing and not making stupid-ass mistake. When you see him play him, you'll be sad that he made the very same mistake over and over. It'll be so embarrassing.8. The Not SureThis guy plays a champion that he knows nothing about. That's his specialty. He knows nothing about the meta in the league, so he's gonna play an old champion because he likes him. He may be good at playing this champion because he's used to doing very specific kinds of things with this champion. He may also know very little about how to use these champions in competitive play.The problem that this guy has is how he approaches it. He tries to do everything right: he'll buy a new item, he'll try not to die and he'll ward so he knows where he and his team are most of the time so he doesn't mess up. He gets frustrated, however, when his opponent messes with him. This isn't always the case though; you can see that every top ranked professional player knows the nuances of the meta around them.Some people think that the problem is that they have poor decision-making. A lot of these people will go into a game and play as if there is no skill ceiling for them. They'll focus on trying to get into champions that are more effective in the current meta than they are currently. However, this is the opposite problem: when you can do everything right, it makes it so that you don't have to change much, since you know exactly how to do and don't feel pressure to change to do better.7.

In the midst of an active campaign during which Republicans have attacked Hillary Clinton over her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state, Donald Trump has had enough. In a new interview, Trump said he plans to sue the federal government until it releases all the previously classified information surrounding the Sept. 11, 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya, according to the New York Times. The comments were made during an interview on New York's WABC-AM. There, Trump referred to Clinton's emails as a "criminal act" because "they were given to the woman." As he is now attempting to claim that there is "no controversy," Trump has provided no evidence to bolster that claim.
The next time you are in the U.S. Embassy for your holiday, try to go to a different building on Sunday morning. That's when a series of protests by Muslims in Egypt, Palestine, and other countries take place across the nation.This is part of a global movement called "Sunday Demonstrations for Freedom of Thought and Expression," or SFIRE for short.The hashtag started when a hashtag started trending on the social network last month, sparking online discussions."What's happening overseas is part of a worldwide pattern of Islamophobia with little to no backlash," said Eman Abu Jamal, one of the organisers of SFIRE."We are not calling for a crackdown on people's freedom of speech. What we are calling for is for global pressure to be applied in the countries and communities that are perpetrating this hatred and intolerance in the name of religion. We are saying 'enough is enough.'"In the U.S., more than 1,000 people are expected to attend the protests in Washington D.C. and another 250 people are expected in Boston.The group is calling on people to send an international message of solidarity with those targeted by religious extremist and anti-democratic forces, with the goal of showing "that people all around the world are united in our struggle against religious fanaticism."The movement is supported by the International Human Rights Commission, the Association of Muslim Lawyers, The Muslim Public Affairs Council, the Muslim American Society (MAS) and The Palestine Center.The Sunday Demonstrations for Freedom of Thought and Expression are part of a national tour to highlight the global campaign in solidarity with religious minorities.According to their website, the goal of the "Stop Theocrats: Protect Religious Freedom Worldwide" tour is to call on governments and all governments and legal bodies to investigate and prosecute governments that persecute citizens because of their faith, to combat violence, intimidation and persecution of those who practice their faith, and to call on the international community to recognize religious freedom as a right for all people globally.The protests will take place in the U.S., Europe, Israel, Australia and the United Arab Emirates.

You can help by expanding it.The Materia System is the universe's most powerful spell and magical theory system, which allows magical beings to operate under entirely different conditions and from completely different theoretical theories.Contents show]TheoryThe theory behind the Materia System is relatively simple. It is stated that all magical beings, regardless of species or abilities, create and utilize Materia to modify the properties of their spells and spells can be modified similarly. The magical theory system as a whole does not affect magical ability as this is controlled by the magical bodies themselves; the theory itself only gives magical beings a way to create more powerful spells from existing spells by adjusting their properties. This makes the Materia System the most powerful source of magic known throughout the Final Fantasy series; the only other source of magic being the Crystal, its source being the Crystal Sphere.Unlike the Crystal and the Gaia Effect, the Materia system only allows these spells to be used within the user's own magical system so it is not possible to use Materia without the ability to control it within the body, although magic users can acquire magic abilities which allow them the ability to control the Materia system. For now, all Magic is a product of the users own magical system and will only work in that environment.The Materia System was revealed by Cloud Strife to be in place to protect all life on the planet from the Chaos energy that was threatening to destroy it. When Aeris, the second Sephiroth in his consciousness, left her body a few hundred years before the events of Final Fantasy VII, and joined the party, her new body has lost her powers to use magic but she can still access the materia system.The primary theory behind the Materia System is that the magical beings called "Elementalists" use materia to create their spells from. The spells that can be created from materia are not known to all magical beings until the materia system was discovered and the magic beings begin to discover each other.The existence of the materia system is revealed to the party when Jenova, the first living creature, emerges from the Lifestream. The Lifestream was said to be a vast sea of sentient life; it is the source of life for other creatures and it can be used by lifeforms to maintain the vitality of their bodies. The idea that the living creatures on the planet should utilize the Lifestream as a source for their energy is rejected because it violates the natural order of the planet.The only known Materia-user from before the events of Final Fantasy VII is Hojo, and he uses the materia system to produce numerous powerful bombs that only explode where they are set to explode, a feature that would later be applied to materia-based bombs of Final Fantasy VII and VIII.Elementalists are shown to use magical spheres called Materia Spheres, which they can either deposit into special magical pools at the base of the pyramids, called Materia Vaults, or they may create at the command of Hojo. The latter is shown to be how Jenova obtained the knowledge she needed to become a being.The Materia system appears to use a form of "magical technology" rather than having an obvious connection to the Crystal, and thus it can be assumed that magical beings are capable of using it. According to the developers, they do not plan to reveal any aspect of its existence.The existence of the materia system is explained by Jenova in its initial dialogue with Cloud, telling him that she had once believed that the Crystal held the secret to understanding magic. She claims that the magical beings at the bottom of the world would never understand it, which is because they never experienced it and thus never know what it feels like. During this conversation Hojo reveals that he had once had a similar dream while investigating Jenova's origins. He had thought if the crystal was in the heart of all sentient life on the planet then it could be used as a source of magic. He had been wrong on this idea, however, as the crystal is not located in the heart. Hojo then states that the crystal was only a "piece of matter", and then Jenova states:As I'm sure you realize, magic is a universal phenomenon. The very possibility this theory is real is more amazing than my current existence. However, since this theory cannot be confirmed or questioned by mere mortals, it must remain as a theory. I can no longer go through the same experience I used to. If my theories were not true, I'd never have become Jenova, would never have caused the extinction of all life on the planet Earth. That is why I must tell you: magic does exist.
I've been getting a lot of questions about what should I do during the time in between a big event like MWC at IFA in Berlin. In response I've decided to post more complete versions of what I do. You can either download them for free here on MWC Central, on the web at:http://www.mwwinds.com/en/?id=25or you can just search for "MWC" in both places and find the pdf files there if that works better for you.
"No one will ever get a better feel for the scale of our problems than to see what it would look like if I was just one of them," Obama said, and he's right.As I noted on Monday, Republicans are right to reject Obamacare as too costly, but they need to do more than that; they also need to reject the idea that Republicans are the solution, the party most well positioned to solve our long-term economic problems.Republicans have spent years telling the public that the problem is that the government is too big, not that it is too tiny: Too much government, they say, means too many taxes, too much bureaucracy, too much waste, and too much dependency. They have made their points. They just didn't talk about our long-term crisis until the 2012 election -- and they need to do more.If the GOP is serious about a long-term solution, then what it needs to do is start by acknowledging what we just witnessed on Monday. It needs to acknowledge that we did not fix what we could not solve, and the only way to fix it is to stop worrying about the "what if" of the future and just get done what we had to get done.We did not fix our long-term debt -- not for two more years, and not much longer. Republicans have no business criticizing Obama for being too "ambitious" or "too political" or too "pessimistic." The problem was not just that we didn't get everything we wanted. It was that we didn't get the right things, and we can only get them next time around.Republicans have spent years telling the public that the problem is that the government is too big, not that it is too tiny: Too much government, they say, means too many taxes, too much bureaucracy, too much waste, and too much dependence.If the GOP is serious about a long-term solution, then what it needs to do is start by acknowledging what we just witnessed on Monday. It needs to acknowledge that we did not fix what we could not solve, and the only way to fix it is to stop worrying about the "what if" of the future and just get done what we had to get done. Republicans will just have to get our priorities straight again, and maybe do it faster.It is still the case that some Republicans and even Democrats recognize the fundamental problem: The government is now a giant government program -- one that is collecting and spending too much money and spending too little in return. The only thing it did in recent decades was to impose new requirements on businesses (or on employees). That's a huge government program!Letting that program grow indefinitely would lead to more, not fewer, government policies and mandates; it would push the size of government into the stratosphere. What we have seen in the last two years is just another example of why letting that program grow is a disaster.The only real solutions are cutting costs on the front end, and reducing the size of government in the back end. But most likely, any cuts will fall on those same bloated bureaucrats who are already so bloated and so overleveraged that they will be forced to cut benefits, cut the quality of care, reduce the number of doctors, and reduce the opportunities for young people to get college degrees, if that's even possible.If Republicans are serious about being the answer to our long-term debt problem, then they must start by recognizing that most of our long-term debt is our own creation and that we can't fix that, just like we can't fix the problems that led to the current crisis.
(written from a Production point of view Real World articleAs the Enterprise begins a rescue mission of Federation colonists, Lt. Worf learns some unwelcome information…Contents show]Summary EditTeaser EditCaptain Picard receives an urgent transmission on his com channel. Lt. Commander Data reports to him that a distress call has been received from the colony of Teralia, in which there are nine hundred colonists trapped by the Borg. All of them are in a state of advanced physiological disease and hypoammonia, a combination of hyper-doses of oxygen and hyper-doses of hydrogen.Afterward, Picard is informed by a Starfleet commander in the colony that the Borg have killed all inhabitants before destroying the colony. Captain Picard then asks for a response. The commander replies that he didn't, but that the Borg did come aboard first. He went on to say that the Borg were able to take over the colony's weapons, computers that control all the machinery on the planet. The Borg also destroyed the colony's air supply in a maneuver to cause all of a sudden hypoxia symptoms. Picard orders the first officer to beam down with a forcefield. Data also beamed down to the planet to assist Picard, who orders his men to search for the Borg vessel, no matter how long it takes.Act One EditPicard orders Dr. Crusher to treat the colony's victims. Crusher is hesitant, even though it will mean that she'll have to keep her patients alive for longer than normal. She tries to convince the captain that he shouldn't hesitate and that the damage is too grave to leave anyone, including the colonists, to die. Picard relents, and he and Dr. Crusher beam back to the Enterprise. While they leave, Dr. Crusher decides to have one of the colonists examine some of his fellow colonists. She finds that the colonists died not from disease but from a Borg attack.Picard orders a full investigation of Teralia. As the Enterprise takes on the crew of the Teralian colony, Picard asks Sisko for a mission assignment. Sisko agrees, giving Picard a mission of taking the shuttlecraft from the colony to Alpha Onias III, where Starfleet is waiting to escort the colonists to Starbase 375. Picard asks Miles O'Brien if he knows where Alpha Onias III is; he guesses the outpost, which Sisko tells him was used as a prison. Picard realizes that if the colony had a colony prison, the Borg ships were there to take down the facility and to kill those inmates once they left. Sisko explains how he learned the truth and gives Picard a brief overview of the colony's status.As Data, O'Brien and a few of the colonists, including Rurigan, head down to the surface of Alpha Onias III, the ship suddenly comes under attack. As the colony's security forces attempt to stop the Borg, only to be cut down by the ships, the Borg begin taking control of the colony's weapons.Act Two EditThe Borg begin by sending the Enterprise away, as they claim they are interested in a study of the Federation ship. As soon as Worf reports to him, Picard orders Worf to destroy the shields of the Enterprise. Worf does as he is ordered, and the ship is destroyed. However, a damaged Borg vessel has just returned to Teralia, apparently because it was too damaged to continue the attack. At the same time, Rurigan arrives, where he finds the Borg and tells O'Brien that he knew what was going to happen and decided not to help the Borg. The Borg then capture Rurigan.An alien creature, who has the title of the Queen of the Borg, demands to know if the crew is Human or not. Picard informs her that Rurigan is human. A Borg drone arrives to inform Picard that the rest of the crew is in the Alpha Quadrant to help them. Picard immediately orders the ship to retreat. The Borg have now been taken over by Captain Sisko's shuttlecraft. The shuttle is attacked but Rurigan manages to survive and they return to the colony.In the meantime, Picard orders Worf to beam down to the surface. However, as Sisko, Data, and O'Brien approach the surface, they find three ships – the Borg ship, the Enterprise, and the shuttle. Picard is relieved to see the shuttle but the Enterprise is unable to leave the shuttle due to its hull damage. Rurigan is able to leave a note which Picard deciphers. It says that the Borg have taken over the colony because they believed the colonists were dangerous to the Borg. Rurigan states that he tried to escape the Borg so they wouldn't take over the colony, yet they still did. The colony began to die, Rurigan claims, but before he dies, he gives Picard a message of some sort.R
"The fact that these are people in the United States who have been granted protection and asylum and that they can come to the United States and work, I don't know what could be more in line with the values of America," Trump said.In February 2011, the Department of Homeland Security had to change the way it accepted asylum applications after it discovered that some Haitians had entered the U.S. legally but had left their native country when they became pregnant with children as a result. The process for applying for asylum had to be reworked to weed out these "abnormally."In 2011, Obama's administration took action to address that problem by requiring U.S. embassies to follow up with the families, and some immigrants who had entered the U.S. legally were deported. Still, the department estimated that 70,000 children had been born at refugee camps in Haiti, which has been one of the countries most affected by the cholera outbreak.[Here's what it takes to qualify for asylum in the United States]The change in U.S. asylum policy took effect in March 2012. Before that, refugees could enter the U.S. without a visa to attend a U.N. refugee camp and remain there. Since the government stopped allowing people to stay at the camps or move to the U.S. in this manner, many people left and went to the U.S., hoping an asylum hearing would help them make their way back. But the U.S. was never quite able to meet its promise to those people who came via refugee camps.U.S. officials estimated that about 9,700 children had gone to Haiti."When we came to the conclusion that we were in over our heads and that we were not going to be able to manage our program for Haitians at all," said Janet Napolitano, head of U.S. Homeland Security at the time. "Most of the problem — the overwhelming majority — was outside the U.S. at that time, and it didn't matter what we did to people who had legitimate refugee claims."In January 2013, two years after Napolitano's departure, Homeland Security sent a memo to the State Department informing officials that Haitians who were children when the earthquake occurred could no longer receive protection from the United States if they sought asylum. (Since then, a separate order has been issued by the Supreme Court that makes this temporary rule permanent, and another for Haitians seeking asylum in the United States.)"The department is not asking for asylum for Haitian children," the memo said. "The department is only issuing guidance to DHS employees to ensure that they are following DHS policy."The policy change had two consequences for the families. First, it pushed an estimated 5,000 to 8,000 Haitians from the United States, according to a 2010 report in the New York Times. The other consequence was a major overhaul in the U.S. asylum process for Haitians."The Obama administration has made changes to the Haitian asylum process that dramatically changed the way that families are handled. And because this new system was the result of an internal review, it is difficult to make an assessment about how the new system has affected the lives of Haitians in the United States," the Times reported.In fact, it was not until the end of Obama's second term before officials began talking about the impact of changes to the asylum process on the lives of Haitians in the United States. A State Department memo sent in November 2015 — two months before Obama left office — said a "number of immigrants" "have not received determinations of credible fear of persecution" in the decade "since the earthquake."For these people, who had been in the country in fear of being deported, they were relieved to finally have a hearing, a U.S. official familiar with the matter told the Center for Immigration Studies' Jessica Vaughan.Under the new, stricter rules the U.S. had in place, there was no longer "a reason for fear of deportation."It does not appear that this is the reason Haitians have been detained in immigration court.However, the Center for Immigration Studies' Vaughan explained that the rules under which people applying for U.S. asylum in the United States must be brought to court have changed. Before 2014, children under 14 could be held for up to 50 days in detention. During this interval, they could have a hearing with their immigration judge. Now, that time can be extended to 120 days, or a year, depending upon the facts of the case.The government has had some success in detaining these refugees. In 2009, the Center for Immigration Studies found that nearly 2,500 children were being held in detention facilities.But those figures may only represent the tip of the iceberg. Vaughan points out that immigration lawyers say that at least some of these people could be actually being held in
By Dr. MercolaA new study finds that, compared to non-vegetarians, vegetarians have better cholesterol and blood pressure levels. But, while the low cholesterol and blood pressure rates may surprise you, these new findings really are all in the timing. A recent American College of Cardiology study found that, for every five pounds of weight a vegetarian gained, their cholesterol levels declined, while the numbers in non-vegetarians followed the pattern of their overall weight. In other words, the vegetarians had the same cholesterol profile as those who were overweight and, therefore, were not affected by the additional pounds of weight they had accumulated.A previous study of the same group of men, also done at Boston's Brigham and Women's Hospital, found that non-vegetarians who gained an extra 10 pounds were more likely to develop heart disease and death."We found a relationship between cardiovascular disease and weight for men and women," says Dr. David A. Katz, director of the Weight Center at the Yale School of Public Health and lead author of both studies. "But we didn't see a similar relationship with non-meat consumption. They had the same risk. That was surprising, but there may be additional risk factors we don't know about."If a person does gain weight, then they may be at a greater risk of developing heart disease. In other words, it's not just about whether they're eating a meat-free diet; it's about what they are consuming when they put their health at risk. Vegetarians have lower rates of chronic diseases overall—higher rates of cancer and heart disease.In the latest study, researchers analyzed the diets of more than 3,000 individuals, averaging nearly 25 years of age. They compared people's cholesterol levels—which indicate their risk of heart disease—to their blood pressure (which indicates their risk of a stroke), as well as their blood sugar. They then looked at other health-related factors such as exercise.The studies were done in the U.S., the U.K. and Canada in the 1980s and 1990s. After adjusting for other risk factors, such as body mass, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, smoking, physical activity and overall calorie intake, the vegetarians had significantly lower cholesterol levels and blood pressure levels than the non-vegetarians did."There is a tendency in the United States for people to be overweight," notes Dr. Katz. "This is because they are eating too much of the foods they're not consuming. Vegetarians may be eating less and have health advantages. The reason these studies are so interesting is that they show that they are eating less meat than non-vegetarians, but they are also eating a lot of cholesterol and other foods that are not good for them."He adds that not eating meat doesn't mean eating zero cholesterol, no matter what type of meat—e.g. tofu—you eat. There are many foods on the meat industry's menu of foods that produce a lot of cholesterol such as pork, chicken, and lamb."One of the surprises in the studies was how low cholesterol has declined in the last 25 years," says Dr. Katz. "In the 1980 study, vegetarians and non-vegetarians had higher levels of serum cholesterol than their counterparts 40 years ago. When you look today, those levels have gone down a lot, to less than 200 mg/dL—below the range at which people experience coronary events."Of course, this raises another important question: If people are eating less meat but eating it in the form of animal fats, can those fats contribute to high cholesterol? Yes, it can, as long as you choose a variety of fats, as they are a healthier source of lipids, Dr. Katz says.That being said, these new findings do not mean that an entire low-fat vegetarian diet isn't wise, says Dr. Jonathan Edwards, director of the University's Health Protection Research Unit. You can still eat whole foods such as fruits, vegetables and nuts, which are high in healthy fats."Low-fat foods are not a diet, nor do they always replace meat in a healthy meal plan," Edwards adds.The bottom line, according to Dr. Katz: "Eat fish, poultry, legumes, nuts and seeds; don't eat cholesterol and animal fats."Also see...Vitamin-Rich Foods Can Boost Your Heart Health »Eating Your Veggies Can Actually Increase Your Longevity »
If the "Star Wars" movies are to be believed, a new galaxy is just beginning to take shape. The final installment of one of the biggest movie franchises of all time, "Star Wars: Episode VIII," is supposed to hit theaters on Dec. 15, 2019. And since it's already the year of the triple-A releases ("Resident Evil 7" will arrive in theaters Dec. 12) and it was also the year of the "Assassin's Creed" remake, it's reasonable to assume that 2017 will be the start of a new year for Hollywood.But as it turns out, that may not be the case for all franchises: In 2015, the year of the "The Force Awakens," "Star Wars: The Force Awakens" broke the all-time box-office record for a non-holiday holiday release. To date, the film has earned more than $2 billion, and it's going strong for a second year running. As for 2017… what does that look like?The only movie that made more last year than "The Force Awakens" was 2014's "Marvel's Avengers" ($1.07 billion). That's a significant drop, but not a huge one, since "Avengers: Age of Ultron" also hit theaters Dec. 4, 2014 and earned $1.1 billion over its first weekend.So to recap: "The Force Awakens" is the biggest non-holiday 2016 release since 2012, and is already the sixth biggest 2016 release. What does 2017 look like?If you use 2014 as an example, you will see three major releases that earned more than "The Force Awakens": James Cameron's "Avatar," the three-peat of Disney's three "Frozen" movies, and the three-peat of Universal's "Jurassic World." If we add "Guardians of the Galaxy 2," which is slated to hit Dec. 17, and consider it a midyear release, it will take center stage, not to mention that Disney has already set a release date for 2017's sequel to "The Incredibles." That means, with the exception of the "Jurassic World" franchise, everything else should be pretty much the same.So 2016. Now, we know that "Avengers: Age of Ultron" and "Jurassic World" and "Jurassic World 2" and "Guardians of the Galaxy 2" are set to appear in theaters over the course of the next two years. "Bourne" is also headed toward its second-season finale in 2017. It'll make a pretty penny if it is, indeed, a midseason release this time around. And "Wonder Woman" is probably going to break one another "Harry Potter" record in the coming years.There's a chance that "Star Wars: Episode IX" and "The Last Jedi" may not come out until the early part of the 2018-2019 release season. They are set to open a few months before the new "Star Wars" film, so it's not totally out of the question to see both films hit theaters during the final quarter of 2018. And even though "Jurassic World" is not due out until 2019, Universal's "The Mummy" is set to hit theaters in late 2018 or early 2019 as well.With that in mind, we are headed into the final quarter of 2018. In 2019, with "Star Wars: Episode IX" still on the horizon, you can expect "The Last Jedi" to make its appearance in theaters before "Star Wars: Episode IX," or "Star Wars: Episode X-Wing in 2020 and "Star Wars: The Last Jedi" a little further down the road in 2021.By 2019, when "Star Wars: The Force Awakens" makes its way to theaters, you will likely start seeing more tentpole releases. And even more major films can still come out over the next few years (with the exception of "Guardians of the Galaxy 2") — especially with the upcoming Marvel films.We will see: If "Star Wars: Episode IX" is the first of the third new "Star Wars" trilogy, then expect even more blockbuster releases in the coming years: "Thor: Ragnarok," "Guardians of the Galaxy," and "Justice League 2," to name a few. And, of course, there's "Jurassic World" 2.And if both "Star Wars" sequels are in the "Star Wars" universe then you may begin seeing films where some characters appear but not others.And, with the exception of "Justice League 2," most movies in the "Star Wars" film universe aren't sequels in the traditional sense and are instead standalone entries of the cinematic universe.So, 2018-2019… or 2019-2020 (depending on how many "Jurassic World" sequels are set to hit theaters)… or beyond, depending on what happens with "Star Wars:
On an unusually warm January afternoon, one of the most popular attractions at the Walt Disney World park was about to get even more popular.The first night of Epcot's 20th anniversary season had arrived, and with it the return of the beloved, iconic "it's a small world"-like attraction "it's a small world." The first guests were greeted with a sign above each of the four different worlds that featured the popular attraction: "Welcome to the World!" "Thank you, thank you, we appreciate the visit!" "We can't wait to see you again!"This time, guests would be able to get their photo-ops at one of the new mini worlds: "it's a small world" took place in the world of "Jungleland."At Disneyland Paris, guests would also be greeted with another "it's a small world"-themed sign. This one was for "it's a small world"-themed Fantasyland.
MADISON, Wis. - The city of Madison could have used the help of a few extra police officers on Sunday at the UW, where a violent rally on campus ended in a massive police response.UW Police Chief Paul Alario told News 3 the city has no money to hire more officers and it's taking a big hit from budget cuts.The mayor says it shows something has to be done.He says the police response to the rally has been too slow, and they could have handled the situation much better because there's not enough officers to respond.There were more than 3,000 people on a public sidewalk in downtown Madison Sunday when a group of about 150 went into the Capitol Square.News 3 asked Chief Alario, "What did you think you were going to do about this? Is it something you'd want done differently?"Chief Alario said it's too early to make any rash judgment, as the crowd got pretty small."So we decided to call for backup and sent six officers up front. They were successful in getting that crowd contained in the Capitol area, then after that they were able to get the crowd in the area where the campus is, and ultimately they were able to keep them that way a little bit longer, but it was a very small crowd, and it was a very volatile situation," said Chief Alario.UW campus police arrested eight people who blocked the sidewalks.Chief Alario said if there was a group of people blocking a sidewalk, police would send in more officers even if there were 50 people.Alario says he didn't think the police's response was adequate until later, when the crowd started moving again, and police took the streets again.Copyright 2018 WISHTV
The two-time champion is under contract for another season, having signed a new four-year deal in 2015McLaren are to continue their pursuit of Fernando Alonso, with new talks over a new contract on the cards in the next few days.The two-time world champion, 34, had been linked with a return to Ferrari after finishing second and third in the drivers' championship in 2016 and 2017 respectively."Fernando would like to remain with McLaren-Honda," said Team Principal Martin Whitmarsh.Whitmarsh added: "We have made it absolutely clear to him he can look for a competitive challenge wherever he wants to be, and it was with Honda that he really flourished."I am encouraged by the current plans he has in place to improve."If he wants to remain with us, of course we should not discourage him, but as to what other opportunities he might have - he has said he would be a good fit at Williams, Ferrari, Red Bull, Williams again - we are not the ones who will be making those decisions. We have other projects we shall be working on."Alonso, who has won nine Grands Prix with the team, made his only statement of the season when he signed a new four-year deal back in June.The Spaniard's McLaren contract was reportedly about to expire in 2018 and with Red Bull reportedly pursuing his signature last week, the Woking team came in for renewed scrutiny."When Fernando does not want to stay with us and he is interested in other alternatives, we welcome that and we have begun the conversation with that in mind," continued Whitmarsh."Hopefully it can get resolved and done fairly soon."
"They say you have to love to lose. That's true, but I feel that the first thing to do is embrace the loss. It's one of the toughest things I've learned in my life, and I do it anyway. I embrace it, because I enjoy it, and I enjoy seeing people have the best time possible. It's in the moment. It's a good reminder."We are honored to release part II of our interview with UFC welterweight champion Georges St. Pierre. Below are highlights:On his relationship with Joe Rogan in the days leading up to the UFC 152: "It was good. I loved him. We talked. I thought it was really cool to learn a lot, and his knowledge was amazing. I love him now."On his new training camp, and the changes he's made to his game in the two-and-a-half short weeks since he picked up to where he left off in Montreal. "It's different. It's fun. We still work on my strength and conditioning, but that's really important to me, that my body is still healthy. I have to keep having a good training camp. I want to always be ready for any opponent. In Montreal, I was so tired on fight night that I had no energy the day of. I think that's always important. But I also think the two and a half weeks that we've been here has been a lot of fun. I've loved it."On his thoughts on the title change, and how the new division is progressing as a whole: "I would like to see it go to the winner of the Robbie Lawler vs. Carlos Condit fight. I think that fight is very good; we'll see how the others go. Now what matters is that we have eight top 15 level fighters. They should have one or two good fights, and then they're going to change it up a little bit.""There's a difference between people that are on top, people that are fighting for number one, and people that are fighting for number 10. When the top guys are fighting for the belt, that's when it's fun. As in Montreal, people were just fighting for the belt every single Friday, Saturday and Sunday. I think that's what you're going to see in the future."On his recent comments on Dana White saying he'd like to make Georges St-Pierre a title challenger to the middleweight title: "I really don't care about the champion, I've fought a lot guys who don't deserve the title. I've fought a lot guys that I didn't think deserve the title, guys who were really great fighters, and they didn't. But it's in the cards. I'll make the most of it and make the best out of what's going to be the most difficult challenge in my career. That's my attitude. That's how I'm going to fight. People say I'm crazy, but then they see it on fight night, they see I'm serious, and they say, 'Yeah, you got this guy.'""I think it's a great opportunity. It's good because for the next time I have to be in this position, I'll be the guy for the new generation."More on that tomorrow, and if you haven't yet, please hit our Facebook page or hit me up after.

(Photo by Matt Rourke/AP)A new report on the U.S. Navy makes plain the Navy's continuing struggle to figure out how to rebuild its shipbuilding capabilities despite recent budget cuts that have forced the service to cancel some planned projects.The Congressional Budget Office's report on the Navy's shipbuilding budget outlook for fiscal 2020 concludes the service may need to boost its defense budgets by around $1 or 2 billion to stay "within reasonable budgetary levels and sustain all existing shipbuilding and development programs with the exception of the aircraft carrier fleet."The budget report did not give specific figures for spending on the Navy's five current and planned new nuclear-powered attack submarines, however.In 2012, then-Defense Secretary Leon Panetta unveiled a plan that would have eliminated the construction funding for two of the new subs by 2019, instead relying heavily on cost savings from the service's existing fleet of Ohio-class vessels. Although the Navy pushed back its planned shipbuilding contract bid for that project to May 2017, the service has yet to award work on the new subs.The service's Navy Sea Systems Command and the Navy's Office of Sea Power each recently submitted requests for proposals for design and construction plans for four new, nuclear-armed, ballistic missile-armed submarines. The bids are due Aug. 29.But the CBO said a large reduction in the size of the fleet is forcing the Navy to take on increasingly large contracts and to focus on a smaller number of ships than it has previously sought as a means of cutting costs."If it is possible to retain, as much as possible, these existing ships and build four new ones, maintaining the same number would result in modest reductions in unit costs and could keep the shipbuilding system at an appropriate level relative to the projected Navy budget," the analysis found, adding that if a smaller number of new subs were made available, "the savings from these reductions could be used to build another three or four ships that would not materially change unit costs."According to the report, the projected growth in the fleet can be attributed to a number of factors, including growing demands for space in the region's port complexes and the fact that the U.S. Navy has long had trouble finding buyers for its nuclear missile subs.But, the CBO said, the Navy also must cut spending from other areas to pay for the new subs."Although the Navy would save money by making fewer ship additions, that savings would be offset by increased costs to operate and maintain these ships in the absence of competition," the study found. "A small increase in Navy ship costs would be offset by lower costs from reduced maintenance or lower spending on certain other expenses."Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1T9YdFk
I have to say I had a hard row to hoe when I found out about a new study from Washington University in St. Louis which concluded that the best way to address climate change is not to just stop emitting greenhouse gases or, at the very least, to stop emitting them at the rate of industrial societies, but rather, to accelerate the rate of industrial societies to reduce greenhouse emissions.In a way, that's a logical conclusion, because the primary objective of industrial society, the sole purpose of society, is to expand human economic and social power. Industrial society is built on the exploitation of natural resources which are then turned into profitable products — often, though not always, goods that serve humanity. Industrial society is built to provide more leisure time to more people than before for more things that serve humanity. The most fundamental, fundamental purpose of industrial society is expanding human economic and social power, and to do this requires increasing the rate of economic growth so that more people can consume more of the world's resources and more time can be spent on consuming.So then, we can take a simple, reasonable, and practical example of the basic model of industrial society, such as the car or the aircraft, and we can see that it is a good model for our future as well. If you want to increase the rate of economic growth, then there are two things you can do. The first, and simplest step, is to build more cars; the second, and most challenging step is to build more air travel. But, you can do both, because the two are not mutually exclusive. If you want to increase the rate of economic growth, then you can increase the rate of commercial motor vehicles like the automobile.Unfortunately, however, the same can't be said about other large-scale industrial societies like industrial society in the U.S. In reality, as described in the new study from the University of Washington, the best way to increase the rate of economic growth is to dramatically reduce the rate of emissions.I won't summarize or summarize the study in great detail, but briefly, it concluded that economic growth is limited and that if we want to achieve the goal of economic development without increasing the rate of emissions, then we will need to dramatically change the direction of economic growth away from industrial society toward a future more closely aligned with an ecological, sustainable, and equitable society for all.Let's explore some of the findings from the study.A quick example: if it were possible for industrial society to double the economic growth rate of the U.S. by increasing the rate of emissions by only one percentage point, that would double the average American family's annual income by $5,000. So if we reduced our rate of emissions by one percentage point, that would almost double the average annual income of the U.S. family. With that kind of potential, what is to stop society from doubling its rate of emissions?According to the study:The economic value of one year's economic growth would be only about a third of the $90 trillion that the United States economy produces annually. With the current rate of growth and with further increases in energy costs, U.S. GDP would grow to $2.76 trillion by 2040. In a different scenario where GDP was limited to only the value of the natural capital in the planet's forests, soils, and oceans, U.S. GDP could be $1.93 trillion by 2040.If we're going to seriously try to limit global warming to 2°C, then if we are going to reduce our rate of emissions there will be many other, more significant steps we need to take which make business even more costly — and this means reducing our economy's profits.In other words, industrial society is built on the idea that economic growth is more than the sum of its parts — it's built on the idea that economic growth is more than a system that is sustainable and equitable. So if you're going to reduce industrial society's rate of emissions enough to reach a 2°C climate target, then you have to increase industrial society's rate of emissions from the current level of 10 megatons of carbon dioxide per year to something like 100 megatons per year — which would require massive and costly investments in infrastructure like airports, oil refineries, coal power plants, and so forth.I'll put more specific numbers in a bit, but it's quite clear that we have to drastically increase the rate of greenhouse gas emissions in response to the world's growing prosperity, which in turn increases the likelihood that the world's rising and growing prosperity will lead to an even more rapidly growing rate of emissions, and so on.I've written about this study's finding that the best way to reduce pollution and economic growth together is to increase the rate of industrial society.So, we would want economic growth to halt and then we would want emissions to drop to zero but we wouldn't want these two changes to be
If you don't have enough space to store a car, a trailer, a boat and a house in your garage, here is a new way to reduce the amount of space you need! I have taken the existing parking space in my house, and added a ladder by which I can store my car. It looks exactly like a garage door opener, so it looks as if I can have a garage door when I walk in.Ladder storageThis garage door is open 24/7, all year round, and I have a very hard time remembering the last time it was closed. This is what a garage door look like from the inside, and this is another shot of the front.For more information and photographs of this very similar solution to the garage door, see this blog post.
A U.S. judge has ruled in favour of a lesbian couple suing their former school and the school district over sex discrimination.In her order released Wednesday, U.S. district Court Judge John E. Jones said the case should be reopened and moved to federal court and that the plaintiffs' lawyers could ask for an expedited hearing."The question is not whether the District discriminated against either the plaintiff or defendants by allowing these two schools to discriminate against Plaintiffs but whether the District or the plaintiff in fact allowed discriminatory conduct and therefore should be liable for the discrimination that followed," Jones wrote in her decision.According to the decision, former Pineville High School Principal Tom Reeder "adopted a policy and practice" of "engaging in a pattern of retaliation and abuse of power."READ MORE: How I became a lesbian at 18Reeder was also sued by the two schoolgirls for allegedly harassing them on school property in the weeks before the girls came out and made them uncomfortable.In the order, Jones wrote Reeder was also aware of two other female students who were also bullied and harassed for being sexual minorities."Yet each instance of harassing conduct was dismissed or ignored by Reeder, and the other two cases were not pursued," wrote Jones.But Reeder reportedly failed to uphold Pineville Elementary School Principal Tim Dickson's orders.Instead, Reeder "allowed discriminatory conduct to continue," wrote Jones."Plaintiffs and all plaintiffs are female persons of same sex who either are sexual minorities or who will be as an outcome of the litigation," wrote Jones.She said the lawsuit could go forward if the plaintiffs are able to meet with Reeder again to find a resolution to the discrimination."While Plaintiffs have met with and spoken to the defendants numerous times over the past several months, the plaintiffs and their attorneys have not had the opportunity to meet with the defendants during this time and to obtain a response regarding the new evidence that the plaintiffs seek to introduce," the judge wrote.The lawsuit was filed by two students, one lesbian and one gay, who attended Pineville High School in Pineville, Alta., from 1989 to 1995.READ MORE: Alberta minister to sue Alberta schools and districts over transgender policiesThe case stems from a lawsuit filed in 1999 on behalf of four women who claimed to have been victims of harassment and abuse when they were students at Pineville Schools.The case was dismissed in 2002, and the parents were awarded a small amount of damages. Another woman who was then 15 did not want the case heard again as she wanted to return to school and "finally have a female role model."The case finally came to light again in a 2014 CBC News investigation when the women came forward to tell their stories. A year later, the Alberta government enacted an ordinance making it illegal for people to target, harass or discriminate against people based on sexual orientation and gender identity.Reeder was fired from his job at Pineville Elementary School in 2014 due to his discrimination claims. He appealed the decision and in 2016 received a $50,000 settlement from the province.
In a story which has echoes of the old 'I'll give you anything you want if you promise not to tell' deal with Scientology, former parishioner Michael Burd, now 43, has entered a multimillion-dollar settlement with the church to resolve a $30 million lawsuit that was filed on his behalf in 2009.On December 9, 2009, Burd, an unemployed construction worker and father of triplets who grew up on the North Side of Chicago, signed up and enrolled in a three-day religious classes that were billed as a rehabilitation program that would "unlock the potentials of our soul and awaken our spirit."Burd did not expect the course to have anything to do with his finances or with him being able to pay off debt incurred by medical problems. Instead, Burd was told that he would be able to go to heaven and be there for the birth of his third child.In addition to the hefty financial settlement — which includes $21 million in punitive damages against the church, and another $17.3 million in punitive damages against three individuals who were ordained in the course — Burd also had a $20 million dollar "personal injury" class-action lawsuit filed on his behalf.Among other things, the suit alleged that the church, along with the individual parishioners, repeatedly defrauded students and former students of $600 per year by giving them false promises.As part of a court filing Monday, Burd's attorney, Robert Sacks, said that during the course, church officials promised students that, if they would give up personal possessions, they would make the required donation to the Church."The plaintiffs were told they were not required to pay and would be 'elated' to have nothing, and as a result they gave more," Sacks told Inside Edition.Former parishioner William J. Smith of West Chicago, who says he became a Scientologist after the class he paid to take in 2003 was canceled and he had to wait another five years to finish, said he was told he would be given a $500 million reward for donating to the church and that the church would use the money to "build the world.""I was taught it would be like going to heaven or winning the lottery," Smith said.Former parishioner Elizabeth Niederhofer of Wilmette attended the course in 2003 and said she paid $400 to be a $300,000 "clear" (a Scientology euphemism for the highest level attainable — Scientologists who obtain the grade are known as "preprogrammed" — in the Scientology religion). Niederhofer, a former teacher in South Side elementary schools, said she paid $8,000 to attend the class and another $3,000 to attend courses for others."It was a dream experience to go to these things — it was a way of getting out of the mundane routine of life and really seeing and feeling the world," she said of the courses. "It did get to the point where you were so full of wonder and wanting to please the people that you are working for. The fact is you did not need the money. If you wanted to have a dream life it was fine."But despite the church's claims, Niederhofer said she did not have to pay until she tried to enroll in yet another class."The lady who helped me was very kind," she said with a shrug during an interview while waiting to go into the courthouse on Monday. "But she told me she could do nothing. I'm still waiting for my check."Sacks, Burd's lawyers, said that the settlement is a great deal for Burd — who, by all accounts, had no income while he was in the church and never received a penny of church money."In the agreement, Burd is guaranteed money and he is guaranteed that he will not be required to pay," said Sacks.Burd's settlement comes after another lawsuit last year by former Scientology church member and now Scientology critic Tony Ortega, who alleged that the church had defrauded students of $12 million over a 22 year period.[Related: Ex-member Tony Ortega files $12 million suit against Scientology]But rather than be satisfied with an outright payout, a hearing date has been set for May 1 to decide the money-sharing agreement."The settlement is a good outcome for Mr. Burd," said Ortega. "The Church has already admitted to committing fraud on these students and this is a good precedent."Ortega is suing on behalf of two of the plaintiffs, who in the 1980s attended Scientology courses in Arizona and California after being recruited by a Scientologist named John Brousseau. Ortega and his plaintiffs claim that Brousseau, one of Scientology's top executives, persuaded them to go on
Brisbane Roar fans have rallied behind John Aloisi as manager despite their team dropping out of the top four to finish eighth on Wednesday night.Roar fans have rallied behind John Aloisi as manager despite their team dropping out of the top four. Photo: Getty ImagesAloisi suffered a shock 3-2 defeat to Adelaide United to hand the Reds an eight-match winless streak that has left them on the bottom of the table.Despite facing pressure to make changes to the side, Roar coach John Aloisi was left unruffled as his squad took the field on a freezing day in Brisbane.The Brisbane-based players, who had trained in temperatures of just 7C, could barely contain their jubilation when Aloisi's side made a substitution in the first 10 minutes of the match.Despite being down to 10 men, Aloisi's side dominated the first half but could not find the net themselves. A free kick in the 37th minute found a gaping hole in the Brisbane defence and former Brisbane Academy product Aaron Mooy lashed home from six yards.
"We don't want someone that is going to make changes based on one or two points of view," he said, "but based on all the factors we see and hear around the state, and based on our own experience."The committee will focus on the issues that most directly affect the average voter, including transportation, school vouchers and health care. That makes for the biggest test yet of the committee's ability to govern itself."There is no other political entity in Connecticut that has a legislative committee like this," said Sen. Paul Davis, a Hartford Democrat and member of the legislature's committee on judiciary. "The people have asked this."Democrats have pointed to a pattern of patronage-laden and often politically compromised appointments to the committee since Gov. Dannel P. Malloy came into office in January 2009. They charged that Mr. Malloy created the legislative committee to curry favor with party leaders, then used the committee as a tool to bypass the normal political process, including voting on bills introduced by Democrats and Republicans.The committee is a new feature of the Connecticut Constitution, adopted in 1967, that provides for a panel to choose the governor and eight out of 16 seats on either the Senate or the House of Representatives. But while the committee is designed as a check against political shenanigans and patronage, Republicans say it has been hijacked by partisan politics.During the spring's legislative session, Republican lawmakers blocked a bill designed to increase the amount of paid sick leave to employees at public companies. They argued that it unfairly punished businesses that had already passed sick leave initiatives to employees before last year's legislature and called for an increase in minimum wage that some Democrats had championed. The Senate eventually defeated a pay increase for government workers.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address.

The committee's two Democrats, who were Republicans who changed parties because they did not like the committee's Republican majority, did not vote."It is a political rubber stamp," said Sen. Diane Allen, a Hartford Democrat and the committee's co-chairwoman. "I didn't get the chairmanship because I had the right political views."Advertisement Continue reading the main storyThe committee is a rarity in Connecticut history, and it has some advantages. It is more likely to reflect a wide range of viewpoints, and to represent the views of the legislature as a whole, Mr. Brown said. That has been especially important in the last two years, with a new Democratic majority and a new Democratic governor, Dannel P. Malloy, elected in 2009.But the committee's members are elected, and the Republican majority can block proposed legislation. Democrats have accused the group of protecting the interests of Republican leaders and of allowing them to act with impunity. The new Democratic majority can also slow down legislation for fear that it might upset the Republicans.Mr. Brown and Mr. Davis said that while they had not seen the committee's members before they were chosen Thursday, they were aware that the group was being stacked in favor of Republicans. The group consists of a mix of members representing the state's five political parties: Republicans, Democrats, independents and third parties.Under the Connecticut Constitution, the panel members receive a salary of $1,300 a year, plus some sick leaves available for a maximum of four of those months.Mr. Davis said he had heard that some Republican members of the committee planned to retire, or even resign, in the near future. He said he feared that even if his own job was safe, the committee might be."If we can't hold them accountable, what's to stop a third party from doing the dirty work?" he asked. "We've already seen the impact that's had. I hope it doesn't come to pass."The committee plans to have its first meeting as early as December and is expected to meet on a biweekly basis. When it is formed this year, it will have six members.
Maine is the poorest state in the nation and many of its working families don't have enough to eat. So why don't more lawmakers and leaders take action on this?The people of Maine know the problem is bad but they don't know the solution.And their frustration is growing.At a recent hearing in Augusta, about a dozen people packed the committee room to testify on the issue, held up signs with messages like "Save Our Jobs" and "Maine Food Bank Needs More Than Cash.""It's something we've all seen or know about in our own personal experience," said Senator Troy Jackson, R-Houlton, during a debate with the state's top lawmaker. "This affects everybody in America."It doesn't help that Maine ranks as the poorest state in the nation, according to the most recent data in early June -- and the gap between richest and poorest is getting wider.And that's been happening since the Great Recession.According to an analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data by the Pew Charitable Trusts, Maine ranks 50th among the 50 states for its poverty rate of 15 percent, and it's dropping. But it's only getting worse.The latest numbers show 15.3 percent of Americans lived in poverty in 2007, down from 16.2 percent in 2007 and 20.9 percent in 1981, according to the Pew data. But it will take until 2030 to get back to where it once stood."Our income inequality is worse than it's ever been. There's nowhere in the United States more unequal," said Rep. Diane Russell, D-Portland, chair of the Legislature's Judiciary Committee, where the hearing took place.Jackson and others said people are taking matters into their own hands.Last year, nearly 1,250 people left Maine for Oregon and Washington states, in part because they say the state did too little to help food stamp recipients. More than 1 in 25 households received benefits from a government food pantry, most of them children and seniors.More than 400 people have filed a lawsuit against the state in Maine courts challenging a 2013 law which required the state's Medicaid program to stop sending meals to people who didn't show up for them on time.And in 2015, a federal court ruled that the state couldn't continue paying benefits to an unemployed woman who'd gone weeks without income while working as an overnight nurse. She wasn't supposed to have been receiving food stamps to begin with.But Jackson, who lives in Portland, called the food stamp case one of those where it wasn't necessarily the federal government that pushed people to get out of Maine.Jackson said food stamp recipients were motivated by poverty and desperation."It just broke my heart, because I feel like I let them down," he said. "It affects everybody in America. And the people I represent here in this state do too. They're going hungry. It affects our kids and grandkids."More than two-thirds of Maine's food stamp recipients are children. Among those age 18-49, more than half live in poverty and more than 60 percent of those who receive benefits are children.When asked what needs to be done, Jackson gave an example of the food pantry."There's a number of people who come in that want to work, but just aren't able to because of all this," he said. "It doesn't take much to set up a pantry. A couple of cans and a refrigerator that was not paid for. These are small things that you can easily do."The issue has become political, too, as Maine Gov. Paul LePage, who calls the food stamps program a "douchebag" and "poverty program disguised as a humanitarian program," has said he plans to push legislation to cut the federal program's funding.Some Democrats in the Legislature are working to find a middle point.Last year, Democratic Senator Roger Katz of Augusta co-sponsored a bill to require recipients of food stamps to undergo drug testing and require them to participate in work and job training programs that would reduce their reliance on the government.A year later, he sponsored legislation that would establish a "meal plan" for able-bodied adults receiving cash assistance who want to get off food stamps and who have children aged 18 and under."Maintaining a healthy lifestyle is important for everyone's health and well-being," Katz said. "We want parents, grandparents and child care professionals to help to ensure a balanced meal plan has a positive impact on children."Katz called that proposal a step in the right direction."It's certainly a step in the right direction that we're able to do this thing that other people have to do to get off, and it's certainly a step in the right direction that no one's losing an opportunity by getting off," said
By of theOne of the country's most well-known and active conservative donors, David Koch, confirmed Thursday the company was in advanced talks to sell a stake of $15.4 billion.The New York Times first reported the news.Koch would not confirm the reported talks to sell a stake in Koch Industries, and a spokeswoman for Koch did not immediately respond to a request for comment."We are at the beginning of these discussions, and we'll continue to have discussions," Koch said. "No comment."A representative for Berkshire Hathaway, which owns Koch's flagship company Koch Companies Public Sector, declined to comment, the Times reported, noting that the company is prohibited from publicly discussing its financial holdings.Koch Industries was the subject of an April 17 story in the Journal Sentinel where it was said Koch Industries was in talks to sell a 40.5% stake to a consortium of private equity firms. Koch Industries also was mentioned in a news release sent out by Koch Industries' political advocacy arm last week.Koch, a founder of the conservative movement and one of the country's biggest funders, is thought to have pledged $400 million to the Republican Party and conservative organizations over the coming years. Koch Industries has spent more than $23 million this election season, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.Charles Koch founded in Wichita, Kan., has donated at least $23.5 million to the Republican Party and conservative organizations over the past 12 years.In the wake of the newspaper story, conservative activist group Freedom Partners also distanced itself from Koch's company."David Koch owns shares of Koch Industries and doesn't have any control over this issue," said Fred Malek, the group's senior vice-president for government affairs, in a statement. "We have not had discussions in the recent past with David Koch regarding his financial interest in Koch Industries and are not currently aware of any discussions that have taken place."In May, an executive with Koch Industries warned a Wall Street Journal reporter not to ask about his own business interests, as he "may get into some problems." The newspaper's report on Koch Industries raised a series of questions from the press about an executive known to have been involved in a political battle with President Barack Obama and a major environmental organization over whether genetically modified food would be allowed to go to market for sale. The executive also was criticized for trying to influence the appointment of former Gov. Christine Todd Whitman as ambassador to the European Union.The Journal Sentinel report came the day after Koch Industries announced it would provide $2,000 to the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources for each of the next three years for the cost of conducting an "Estate Tax Assessment."The firm also has a longstanding history with Wisconsin taxpayers. The company has paid for more than $8 million in state employees to work on projects, according to documents obtained by the Journal Sentinel.In addition, Koch Industries has paid over $7 million in wages to employees at factories in Wisconsin since 2010, according to the Journal Sentinel report.The $1.15 billion sale would represent a 25% increase in Koch Industries' market value over last June's closing, which valued the company at about $12.7 billion.The company has been struggling for years under the weight of $100 million in toxic cleanup costs after a chemical leak occurred in 2011 near its refinery in Port Arthur, Texas.Koch is known for its aggressive political advocacy campaign and political spending, especially on behalf of Republicans, and in support of issues like cutting taxes, limiting government regulation and repealing environmental regulations.
From the perspective of the United States, the fight over the Iranian nuclear program is less about a single country's security and more about what kind of world we are dealing in. Iran is a major, strategic nuclear power that has repeatedly violated a dozen or so UN Security Council, General Assembly, and other international norms. Its activities are undermining our national and regional interests while threatening the peace, security, and stability of the Middle East.We need diplomacy to help us resolve this issue, and we will continue to use every diplomatic, political, economic, and military lever, including sanctions, to put pressure on Iran to abandon its enrichment programs and meet its international obligations. At the same time, we need to be prepared to defend the vital interests of the United States, allies, and partners at every turn. When necessary, any president needs the authority to deter Iran from violating its international obligations and defend the nation and our interests against threats, whether they come from a terrorist organization or a rogue regime.AdvertisementBut the United States cannot succeed in our efforts if we ignore, or even play down, Iran's ongoing violations of international law. So long as Iran continues to pursue nuclear weapons and the means to deliver them, its actions that threaten us and our allies will be treated no differently from any other non-weapon state that has been an active player in the world. And any strategy that involves containment — such as sanctions, containment, containment, or containment — will fail. It will not work.As Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton spearheaded a successful effort to convince Russia, China, and Iran together to agree to a UN Security Council resolution that imposed tough sanctions against Iran for its refusal to fulfill its obligations and for its continuing missile program. As she has stated repeatedly, this is what we have to focus on in terms of Iran's nuclear weapons program from here on out. We need to have the international community's back in pushing back on any other non-state actors that seek to do us harm.The bottom line here is not simply the threat from Iran. It is the nature of a nuclear arms race in which a bad actor in Iran could rapidly increase its stockpile of nuclear material in a way that might make the United States, Israel, or our European allies less safe. Indeed, there is a real risk that this is how proliferation could spread across the Middle East in the coming years.AdvertisementSo far, we cannot rule out the prospect of a nuclear arms race in the Middle East, where a state's pursuit of the means to deliver a nuclear weapon could bring about the end of the Middle East as we know it. If we cannot manage this issue with resolve — if negotiations are not enough to bring these two states to the table — our policy of containment could prove a mistake. And that is a threat to the United States and the rest of the world.But if we manage to resolve this peacefully, then the United States should not give up. We should have the support of our allies and partners in the region. We need to take steps to address the root causes that fuel terrorism and help drive the terrorist recruitment of young men and women in regions dominated by extremists, including confronting the root causes that motivate radical ideas, including an anti-American, anti-Western narrative that is propagated by al-Qaeda and its affiliates. The United States and our partners must also focus on strengthening civil society, including in the region, in order to build trust between citizens and those who seek a political solution — including a way to prevent or reduce grievances. If we do not resolve this issue in the future, then any chance of a peaceful resolution to the threat from our adversaries seems remote.AdvertisementSo the bottom line is that we need a comprehensive strategy — one that focuses on addressing the root causes that drive the conflict, not on short-term tactical strikes or military operations.We have to work hard to ensure that America's diplomacy works and that sanctions are credible. But we also have to work hard to maintain a united front with our allies, including Israel and Gulf Arab states. When we do this, Israel will continue to have security and stability in the Middle East and will not fear that Iran's growing nuclear capability will threaten its security. Our European allies will have more leverage to rein in Iran's behavior, particularly when the nuclear negotiations begin. And this does not mean our commitment to Israel should diminish. As Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton led the effort to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons through her efforts to negotiate a credible deal, and it is incumbent upon us to fulfill that commitment.Our allies and partners in the region also make crucial contributions that will contribute to America's interests and security in the region. They will remain vital partners and we should continue to make progress in the peace process while continuing to support the Arab Spring — including by facilitating the formation of a governing structure. A new generation of leaders will emerge in Libya, Tunisia, Egypt, and throughout the Arab World, and we should work with them to
On this episode, we discuss the best ways to deal with a bully, how to get past your phobia and how to handle a panic attack. The show covers topics of: How do you deal with an abusive person? How do you deal with someone who has an issue of self-esteem? How do you deal with panic attacks? We also explain how to get over your phobia and how to handle a panic attack. The show will help to explain why we are who we are and why we react the way we do when in situations that give us no choice.This is a very unique episode for a couple of reasons. First, it was recorded in one day and it was recorded in one location. It also happened to be just after my birthday and as a result some of the jokes were even a bit less funny. This is a show that I have created with the intent to help listeners deal with problems in their lives that they may face. The topics that were addressed throughout the episode include: dealing with bad situations, dealing with difficult people, anxiety and panic attacks.The show is very easy listening and the best way to do that is by trying the show out to understand it in the way I explain it. I hope that you enjoy the show as much as I have enjoyed creating it and that is enough for me, especially with the fact that it was recorded one day before my birthday.Forum link – http://forums.truespeaklearningsolutions.com/index.php/topic,3155.0.html
Lately I've been looking for a way to get more of my work published. I've looked for things like blogs, books, etc. but these are great as starting points, but how many of them have actually resulted in someone actually buying a book? So I've decided to make this little list of sites that offer the exact same service as IndiePublishingGuide.com, but for you to make the call yourself.I've only included blogs that appear in the top 100 sites on Alexa, Google, or a similar service. These websites have the capability to set up e-publishing on many different options, but as with most things in life, a small selection of quality publications is preferable. And for what it's worth, I'm not including my own blog.There are a number of blogs listed below, but I'm not entirely happy with this list; it was never my intent to include all the best blogs out there. And in any case, if you know of another good platform for getting your work published, leave a comment below!I'd also be interested to hear if anyone has a favorite site for authors, that's not listed above! If you feel that these sites are worth adding to this article, please comment below.
BEST ANSWER:I am assuming yours is a newer car, so you are able to upgrade your engine as you wish. My model year 2.8L 4 cylinder engine is still relatively new though. Many of our 2.5L 4 cylinder engines use the same timing belt, even though both the timing belt and the engine block differ. The only difference is the timing belts and block.The engine with the 2.5l was about $2,000 USD when I bought mine. That has been reduced quite substantially in the last 10 years or so. So if you don't mind the money going down, by all means upgrade the engine. At my age, it may be worth the money to save a little money on fuel and maintenance.I have heard that you can buy your way out of the problem, but I haven't done that.
We've been following the progress of the development of the "Kubrick: The Making of the Masterpiece" feature for a while, and the latest development in the film-making process is to focus on one of the big problems with the movie: the fact that we never really know what's going on.For the uninitiated, here's the basics: Kubrick was given a master shot that was used for his film, and then, in addition to that master shot being sent around as some sort of preview for people to see, he was also given a "cinematic edit" -- which he would then have to finish once he was done shooting. Those two cuts were then combined, and there were no words added to either cut, which was meant to allow Kubrick to work at his own pace until the very last minute to perfect the editing.And once he was finished shooting his movie the way he wanted, it was then handed over to director David Lean, so that he could "cut" the movie, adding scenes, inserting effects, etc.This process -- while it may not seem all that unusual -- was a very difficult one for Kubrick as his time was running out, since this movie would be in theaters when his contract with Warner Brothers ran out in January of 1968. So the film was edited in what is known as the Kubrick Method, a sort of process that Lean did which was very unique and very difficult to pull off properly.So far it seems that while Kubrick and Lean were producing their masterpiece and working on their own process for filming it, the director began his film's edit in January of 1968 and began cutting it in the middle of the year. That means we were left in the lurch and didn't have the chance to hear all of the editing in progress until much, much later.So how did a major movie like "A Clockwork Orange" end up with two very distinct cuts? The obvious answer is that the original two-hour film was released two months after the end of Lean's master reel (which the director used to cut in). So by the time Lean had finished working on the edit, Kubrick had already shot his two masterpieces and was working on a final cut of the movie, meaning the two masterpieces were completely separate -- they did not come together until after Kubrick had completed the finished film.However, that still doesn't explain why there was no commentary track for the movie.So now it seems likely that the two cuts were made on the same day by different editors, and one of those editors (probably Kubrick himself) worked on both, while the other didn't edit anything at all. Because of the editing process, we have pretty much no idea about either cuts whatsoever.And now we're learning that "Kubrick: The Making of the Masterpiece" will feature something that's never been seen online before: the film's original commentary track.According to TheWrap, director of the project Eric Fellner was recently asked if the commentary would be aired -- although with no official word from Lean, it's unclear who will be doing this work for Kubrick's film. But Fellner assures us that while nothing is official, he's hoping to put together a commentary track for the movie, based on a lot of previously published material. The original commentary track will then presumably air on a future Blu-ray release of the "Masterpiece."But there's no word about when or where that is being released -- this could very well be another delay until Lean's edited cut comes in a month or two, or even longer with a little more work.
Fashion is big business. The latest high profile brand to jump on the latest trend is Lululemon Athletica (LULU), Canada's second biggest athletic retailer. Not just any athlete, LULU's most notable athlete is none other than none other than Olympic Weightlifter Adam Ondra who set a new Canadian Record for Men's Handstand Clean and Jerk at 149 pounds (70.85 kg)! This feat was accomplished by the 23 year old with both his teammates as well as the crowd witnessing his incredible feat.The brand has been around for quite some time, originally introduced in 1992 as a brand called Lululemon. In 1996 the company expanded into a second location in Vancouver which was called the Banting Facility. In 2000, the company became much more recognizable, with a new store design featuring a colourful, futuristic theme which has now become the LULU brand.Today, the Lululemon brand encompasses a variety of athletic clothing, footwear, and accessories designed to help its customers reach their goal of becoming the best athlete they can be. Its latest trend is that of performance gear, which aims to push the limits of human performance.The brand had been criticized recently for a number of reasons and has come under a lot of scrutiny, including the company's use of unpaid internships and its apparent conflict of interest, among other issues. In response, the brand has issued new guidelines on how it will handle its internships in hopes of changing the public's perception. Here is what Lululemon's new policies were issued today:"The purpose of a placement is to have an Intern gain valuable real-world information about how people perceive our products. By engaging in this program, an Intern is giving LULU an opportunity to learn and gain valuable real-world understanding about where we draw the line and how we can better serve our customers. The Interns are asked to participate in a full, 12-month placement and work a minimum of 4 days per week with LULU's retail partners."As a brand, LULU has worked a long road to improve its reputation in the industry and has done so in a manner that is consistent with the company's values and principles. LULU's new policies will hopefully be a step in right direction and will help the brand become seen as a reputable brand not only in the fitness industry, but across the board.

"One of the things that I was really interested in was getting a really broad range of opinions," Molyneux says."We've got a very small audience. It's a really small market. A lot of developers are making games because they've been playing them for awhile, and they kind of have a personal bias as to where they are. And I feel like we need to get the vast majority of developers out there and let them make their opinions known and then talk to them about that. They know their stuff, they want to know their opinion, and their opinion isn't necessarily shared by the market. If it were, everyone would have been making games ages ago."You'll be able to find Molyneux's new game out on PC next month, although Molyneux is mum on its exact platform. The game is being developed by Double Fine Productions, a company founded by Molyneux's right-hand-man, Greg Wohlwend. Double Fine has experience with the new generation of gaming hardware, being the creator of the immensely popular Broken Age on both Xbox 360 and PC.And then there's the Molyneux Factor"I've got a lot of experience with this, having been involved with the PC from a developer's point of view," Molyneux explains. "So I've been playing games before the game was released. I've worked in studios that have been publishing games before the game was released, so I've the perspective of how hard it is to make a game and how easy it is to make a game. It's a big challenge."Then there's the fact that I'm a businessperson with a business background. I also understand technology better than almost any of them. That's a really big thing. I've got an unusual way of seeing things, which I think can be helpful. And I'm passionate about getting it out there. I want people to be able to talk about it, see what people are making. There are two levels of involvement."Molyneux points to the fact that the studio he founded to create games that he had a personal interest in made the classic platformer adventure GrimFandango. And while it wasn't commercially successful there was a loyal following when it released."It was successful enough to have a following," Molyneux says. "I know that in certain areas of the world, we're seen as being kind of niche, so you can make a game that you're passionate about where people have some interest. We made games that had a real cultural relevance for people, and people were interested in them. That's what I want this project to help with. I'm passionate about it, and I can't wait to talk to as many people about it as I can."Double Fine is also the parent company of a number of other independent games, including Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons and Costume Quest. Other companies in the Double Fine circle include Peter Molyneux, who now leads all the games Molyneux creates."I see myself as kind of a one-way street," Molyneux says. "I don't like being told what to do. That's one of the weird things about being the boss of a company like this. I don't have access to any people who work for Disney, for example, where they're constantly telling me what I want to do."He adds: "I try my best to be a very open person who listens and talks with his staff about what people are doing. But I'm also very stubborn. And maybe I'm right. I think in certain areas of a company where the management has a tendency to follow the herd, I think there's a lot of power in the independence that comes from being a one-man band. And we're in that position, and we know it. There was a lot of discussion about the way we got around all that, but we stuck with it and continued doing it."A game Molyneux hopes will excite and engage more people isn't just for himself or his development team of roughly 25, it's for the broader public."When we started off our company, [it was more like] an idea in my head," he says. "A few years later, and now we're a business, we've made a couple of games. But you get to a point in the game development process where you realise, 'No, that is not what this person really wanted to do, so we're going to start from scratch.'"That's the game he's working on now. And whether or not it will ever reach the masses is up to the fans."It's kind of like a Kickstarter," Molyneux says. "It's not like we're going to sell it in the store, we're not going to make it available.
As he did last year, Trump will have a special dinner on Saturday to honor his favorite sports team, the Washington Redskins. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)Former presidents have traditionally spent the week before Thanksgiving at their homes. But during that same period, Donald Trump will spend Thanksgiving at his Trump Castle in New York. The Republican president may or may not have a dinner with himself, but no matter what he's doing during the holiday, you can be sure the media will attempt to portray it in the least positive ways possible.The good news is that Trump won't have to worry about those pesky questions about his presidential qualifications. Trump has no interest in talking about Trumping for political or personal gain. He's far too busy campaigning for the re-election of his family's legacy, despite being the sitting president of the United States.And that makes the Trump dinner the perfect chance for media to turn up the heat and throw mud at the 45th president. And so it will be – a week when the news media may finally be forced to actually think about whether to criticize or praise the new president.Here's our guide to our three favorite ways to attack the next commander-in-chief over this Thanksgiving.First, throw around any number of "facts" when describing Trump, and the news media should take them seriously. For example, "While at his golf clubs, President Trump has reportedly called for the creation of a new tax on foreign visitors" is a pretty good way to attack a person. "Trump was so dismissive of NATO that he called for a new way to fund it that would not require the United States to spend its money on it. Trump's statements on Russian President Vladimir Putin were "mixed." It was also revealed that Trump failed to disclose millions of dollars of assets, which will make this a tough month to defend. If Trump's tax returns show the Trump campaign's finances have been substantially off the books, we can expect them to turn into more attacks on Trump for being hypocritical."Second, focus on Trump's business ties, even as he tries to run the country. There's no point in giving him a chance to do any good with this, because it won't work. Trump is now facing the threat of Russia's meddling in the election by trying to undo what Democrats did. Trump needs to get on his knees in front of Putin and say, "I have a message for you: I am sorry for what you did to me and for those my campaign attacked – I am still in your debt as long as you honor my promises." This will be the first major foreign visit Trump makes since he won office, and he is already suffering from negative press because of that. If, on the other hand, Trump can simply walk away and refuse to have an official meeting with the Kremlin, a victory would be assured.Third, get the president to say something outrageous. Remember how we were all supposed to hate Obama by comparing him to Hitler? Well, this time, the best Trump can do is be a bit Trump-y with regard to Putin. "I want to thank President Putin for a very important meeting on the issue of missile defense and security cooperation," he told reporters Wednesday morning. You can probably guess what came to his mind — this is why Trump wins!There's a good chance that even Trump won't be able to resist making an extraordinary statement during Trump's Thanksgiving dinner. What we hope this means is that we are on the precipice of a massive, unprecedented political backlash at the end of this month — an unprecedented backlash against the media's ongoing efforts to discredit President Trump."There's no way to deny that there's a firestorm," says David Frum, a former speechwriter for President George W. Bush who now writes a column for the Atlantic. "It just might take months of Trump having to get through the Trump dinner alone before the world notices how awful the news coverage has been. But I don't think it will take long before Trump's numbers start to improve, and maybe then it will be possible to talk about the media at all."But Trump might not get any better news coverage from his dinner with the Redskins than he has under his belt. We've already seen the news media criticize what Trump said at that dinner, which is to say, whatever he said at the dinner. Remember that Trump has been accused of saying terrible things about women, Latinos, Muslims and African Americans. Some of these things were not true, and some were, but it doesn't matter. The media can't let up because the truth doesn't matter — and as a result, Trump has gotten a lot of free publicity."Trump doesn't even have to say anything that anyone wants to hear," Frum says. "He just needs to get his team together to tell them to say nothing that anyone wants to hear."The president has, of course, been saying lots and lots of things that
As part of his push for more gun control measures in 2014, President Barack Obama asked to come back to Washington to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee on gun violence. He testified on April 23.In the midst of the hearing, Obama spoke to reporters in the Rose Garden. "We're going down the path set by other, more common-sense steps that people have taken in the United States of America in the wake of terrible, terrible tragedies."Here are five things we learned at the April 23, 2014, Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on gun violence:1. Gun violence is a public health issueObama said that since the December 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School, "the American people have spoken," in favor of stricter gun laws. "[O]ur nation has been shaken by violence," Obama said. "It is one thing to stand up and address this issue in the media. It's one thing to say, 'What's causing this violence?' It's another thing to get your arms around it and make a difference." Obama urged lawmakers that "we need to pass common-sense gun safety laws as a matter of political decency not just for ordinary Americans but for law enforcement too because if we don't, there will continue to be incidents like this where people are shot and killed simply because of the way they walk down the street."The president also announced a task force to study how to keep guns out of the hands of those who shouldn't have them. "I want this to be a task force that's bipartisan and does not rely on politics."2. The nation's gun violence problem is getting worseIn his address, Obama acknowledged that he had spoken before Congress, but "I've not had the opportunity since then to sit at that table with the folks on the Republican side of the aisle. So to help us with our analysis, I asked a group of law enforcement officials to join me and our top White House law enforcement official. And we put together some data to be able to talk about the problem of guns with folks on the other party."Obama noted that the gun violence problem has only gotten worse in the years since Newtown, and that "over 500 Americans have been killed by guns so far this year alone." He then took it a step further, suggesting that the government needs to crack down on those who are buying guns from "a number of different markets. ... Some firearms, you can go online, and then you can be able to purchase a firearm at a gun show, or, as I indicated earlier, other private businesses have websites, and you can buy those as well."3. New strategies to reduce gun violence can workObama's chief strategist David Axelrod, who was at the podium in the Rose Garden, said a lot of the proposals proposed by Democrats in Congress would not have worked before the Sandy Hook shootings. Now, he said, that's "changing the conversation" around gun control because there are "more and more studies showing that you can reduce gun violence without infringing on the rights of law-abiding citizens." Axelrod said he expects the president to continue to take up these ideas when he's back in Washington.There's a problem with Axelrod's line of thinking. It's not just that Congress passed gun control measures after Newtown, it was that all of the measures made the U.S. much safer by keeping guns away from criminals, while keeping guns away from kids.And that doesn't just mean "more background checks," it's also stopping people from buying weapons they can easily steal and using those guns to commit a murder.In other words, Obama's proposals to reduce gun violence will do very little to protect Americans' fundamental rights; instead, Obama and his administration are using the Newtown tragedy to continue to impose more gun control restrictions.4. The Obama administration isn't following up on its promise to increase background checksThe administration has promised to do more to tighten the background check process, but it hasn't been following up on its promises.On several occasions, Obama and his administration have claimed that the number of background check requests by the FBI has tripled since they began conducting them in the wake of Sandy Hook. In a May 31, 2013, address, Obama said, "As part of our commitment to strengthening our nation's gun laws, I'm announcing that next year the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives will begin tracking how many gun dealers and firearms traffickers have been arrested or convicted of crimes using illegal guns." He didn't say how many of those convictions were related to gun crimes or how many of the records were due to prosecutions. And he didn't say how many criminal convictions were for gun crimes.When Obama said "next year," he apparently meant, "after December 31" because the White House would not be releasing statistics on those criminal convictions from 2013 or 2014.Since October, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives
(CNN) -- The National Security Agency's massive wiretapping programme has been running for nearly nine years, yet there is no mention of it in any of the five annual reviews of the secret court that oversees US intelligence agencies, according to NSA documents obtained by The Intercept.At least one document, dated August 3, 2008 -- almost three years before the first Snowden leaks -- described the controversial surveillance programme in detail, noting, "There has been no change to the government's position and we are continuing to adhere to that position" in a classified memorandum sent to various NSA offices around the country.In other documents, the NSA has repeatedly said its bulk collection of US telephone records ended on June 1, 2011 and has never provided an update to the court that handles applications from the government to access the records."NSA will not ask the Court to extend the order beyond the expiry of June 1," said the NSA in a filing to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court dated August 23, 2011.An unidentified NSA official, quoted in a filing signed the same day, wrote that the programme had "remained effective" since then.The document, dated June 1, 2011, was part of the Fisa court docket, which is a series of documents submitted to the court by the government, revealing whether its applications were still being considered.The documents show that, in September 2008, the NSA asked the Fisa court to extend the wiretapping programme for one year and to keep it in place for an additional six months. Neither the document nor comments provided by the NSA were released in a search of the Fisa court docket records.In addition, several documents provided by the NSA during the same period have been redactions since they were leaked by Snowden.The NSA also said that its bulk collection of US phone call records had been discontinued on October 31, 2011, the day before President Obama unveiled a surveillance programme aimed at stopping US citizens from being caught up in NSA eavesdropping on overseas telephone conversations, in a speech to the nation last month.In contrast, the NSA previously acknowledged in a filing in March 2012 that it had continued to store copies of all the phone metadata it had collected since at least September 2002, and that it had been doing so since 2006."Until further notice, all the NSA continues to retain the meta-data of all calls made in the United States for the purpose of querying for its investigative targets," wrote the agency in a filing to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.In a filing dated September 5, the NSA also explained that it had retained and could access "the meta-data as it existed or may exist following the elimination of collection," in the wake of the Guardian published Snowden leaks in June 2013.The NSA also maintained that it was "continuing to collect data," despite the program being shut down."During the transition period, NSA has been using its foreign collection platforms with the intent to collect metadata or 'meta-data', and data relating to US persons in foreign intelligence collection operations," the NSA said in a filing, adding that the metadata was "currently retained by the foreign collection platforms."The NSA did not immediately respond to calls for comment.In late July 2009, then-CIA Director Leon Panetta told the Senate Intelligence Committee that the NSA had a program to search its databases to get back phone metadata from its overseas partners, but said "that program has, for the most part, been discontinued.""There's no program currently in use by the United States intelligence community that is a blanket system for getting back every single name that's dialed, that's placed on a telephone," Panetta told the committee. "No such program exists."In a court filing dated October 31, 2013, the government acknowledged that one of its surveillance programs may still be active, though it said it was not collecting bulk phone data.Earlier this year, the intelligence agency declassified its application to collect bulk telephone data from Verizon under Section 215 of the Patriot Act. The agency cited national security before approving the request."I don't want to call you the NSA," White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters on Tuesday when asked if Obama would seek to reauthorize bulk collection, a reference to the previous administration."I think what the president is focused on here is not trying to reauthorize an expired section of a Patriot Act that is, at its core, about phone metadata," Earnest said. The administration plans to address the bulk collection when Congress reconvenes, he added.
As we get set to open the curtain on our 25th season next April, it is important that we talk about our goal for the next 25 years.Our goal is to keep the club as strong as it has been for many, many years with a strong financial base to do so. If we do not get it right next year we risk seeing our brand suffer and the club lose its soul.At the moment there is talk that we might be allowed to make one more acquisition of a quality player, a more attacking player as we look ahead.That is fine with me. But we know what our plan is. We know what we have to do and we know how we want to put things right come the second half of the season.We want to keep pushing on and we want to make it to the end because we believe this club is special and will continue to do so.A great fan base and a real commitment from players and all of us to deliver, will keep this team competitive year after year.We have to look long and hard at last season, where we were close to missing out on the Premier League, how we ended up second from bottom and then we got the message – that we are a very professional outfit, and everyone has learnt from where we went last season.We have seen a couple of players leave but there have also been a couple of deals that have been well received (Daley Blind, Jack Rodwell and Moussa Sissoko). So, I hope that there will be no problems, but it is all for the good if they have a little delay.But we will look to strengthen and we will keep pushing hard towards the first team and the League Cup.
Kotaku East East is your slice of Asian internet culture, bringing you the latest talking points from Japan, Korea, China and beyond. Tune in every morning from 4am to 8am.On the occasion of the 60th anniversary of the Tokyo Olympics, Japanese sports journalist Atsushi Nishino-sensei penned a column in the popular weekly magazine Asahi Shimbun. In it, he discussed a number of things: why women couldn't play sports, why the Olympics have no women and why so many Japanese are afraid of flying.For many people, the Olympics are the most high-profile event in all of Japan, and the best way to experience them is to visit the host city just before the games, and even stay until the very last minute of the games.AdvertisementThe Olympic Games are an important cultural and economic event for Japan at a time of social, economic and demographic change. Because of the Olympic Games, Japan is one of only 7 countries in the world in which the majority of the population participate in the games every four years. As of this year, the world's first ever female Olympian will compete for the United States in Rio de Janeiro.On July 14 and 15, 2020, a total of 7,766,500 visitors from all over the world, including roughly 7.3 million spectators from the United States, will visit Tokyo. There will be four venues to visit: Tokyo, Yoyogi National Park, Gifu Prefectural Park and Hakone, the northernmost metropolitan area.AdvertisementThe Tokyo Games are a chance for the young generation of Japanese citizens—especially those born between 1958-64—to see a world they thought they didn't know, and to experience something about themselves that they never did before. The Tokyo Olympics are important because of the economic and social benefits of tourism the games bring about.For many years, Japan only exported tourism and entertainment products to the countries in Asia with which we have diplomatic relations. But now, with the introduction of the G20 summits where the leaders from 20 countries from Asia and Oceania meet every three years, Japan is becoming one of the largest contributors of tourism to the Pacific Rim region.In 2013, about 10,500,000 visitors came from the Far East. The G20 summit will be the largest tourist event in the history of the G20, with over 120 million people expected to attend. These visitors will drive a large part of the country's economy. Japan will be the third largest destination for touristic visitors after China and the US.AdvertisementAnd in the months leading up to the Olympic Games, it is the number one destination for foreign tourists from China to Japan, so they do not simply travel to the country hoping for good experiences. Chinese guests are typically there to take advantage of Japan's beautiful scenery and great restaurants. They are also typically there for one or two week long tours of some sort.This is also the case for those visiting from the United States: they are primarily there for family tourism, with many in their 20s staying for two weeks.But despite this, Japan's gender imbalance in sports and other areas has raised concerns among many Japanese citizens. In May, at least 30,000,000 people took the time to sign an online petition demanding a new quota of women in sports. The petition was called to increase the number of women by 100 percent in sports such as golf, archery, gymnastics, fencing, swimming, and taekwondo. And if the country continues to have male-only sports such as golf, it would make up nearly half of the participants in 2020.Nishino-sensei's Asahi Shimbun column, on the other hand, doesn't exactly make it about women's issues either. It's about how Japan is going to be fine by playing a big role in hosting the Olympics.AdvertisementAdvertisementAs you can see from the photo of the author in his office, it's pretty much a whiteboard with his signature on it, which explains why the column is called "The Olympics will save Japan." It's a really good column. We'll just leave it here.Asahi Shimbun [via IT Media]Email the author at zachary.bonner@japantimes.co.jpAdvertisement
KIEV, Feb 11 (Reuters) - Ukrainian authorities said on Wednesday they had arrested three opposition activists who they say planned to storm the parliament building and were attempting to arm militants who have threatened to stop a vote on constitutional reform that opposition groups consider illegitimate.Two men were arrested as they prepared to go to the building, while the third was arrested on the street near parliament, Interior Minister Arsen Avakov said. Police detained five other people at a bus station in the western city of Lviv, the ministry said.Vitaly Klitchko, head of Ukraine's largest nationalist party and one of the two men arrested, was detained at least once for protesting outside the parliament.At the parliament on Wednesday, deputies voted to hold snap parliamentary elections next year, while opposition leaders boycotted the vote and some MPs left parliament in protest.The deputies will resume their work on Thursday, when they could potentially vote to send the constitutional reform legislation to a referendum. It would be the third vote on the issue in less than a month."Our goal is to prevent those who want to take power by force from seizing Kiev," Klitchko said in comments broadcast by Ukraine TV.Klitchko was detained in the town of Volodymyr-Volyns'ke, also near Kiev, on the eve of a march in Kiev by right-wing nationalist demonstrators who have threatened to take to the streets again if constitutional reform is not approved.(This version of the story was refiled to fix first name of detained man in paragraph 1)
What's Wrong With Bollywood's #1 Female Comedian?A recent media report said that Bollywood's biggest actresses including Aamir Khan and Shah Rukh Khan don't get good reviews from a young male audience for their movies.These reports went hand in hand to point out that women of big stars get less sympathy from the audience and this is a source of criticism for Bollywood because men are used to seeing big female stars as a dream, sexy and alluring female character. In such cases, they aren't used to seeing their favourite big stars in an all-round manner.I agree that such reports reflect the problems that Bollywood's biggest stars are facing due to the lack of empathy and sympathy given by the male audiences to the female stars. But I think this report itself is wrong.To be fair, these reports can be dismissed as either being based on a mistaken view of audience responses because they are very popular, or a result of overstating the problems faced by these big stars.But let's look at things from another perspective. I have observed the reactions of young men who have seen the recent Bollywood films based on female stars, Shah Rukh Khan's Raaz (2015) and Aamir Khan's Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (2015)In Khan's case, there is a huge demand for his movies in all markets since his movies and the film industry in general are so successful. It has been reported that the tickets of these movies are selling like hotcakes, and at the same time, Aamir Khan is reported to say that his films will get more attention for being 'family friendly'.Here are some of the reactions of these young men who have seen Khan's movies:"They are good movies with a great storyline. They are the perfect balance between being romantic and being funny. The female lead is pretty good. They have got some great stunts at the movie sets. Both the leads look pretty good. This movie is always entertaining.""Shah Rukh Khan. He is a big hit here. He is a great actor, he is cool with all that is going on. His movies are always good. He has done many good movies for us in the past, he is still popular with us. He is a good actor""It is good. The movie looks quite good. I am not saying this is a bad movie, in fact I like it. It is not all about the sex, even in Bollywood, it is about the story, the story of these actors is all about family in the background. They are all about that. I like seeing women working like that in Bollywood. This is the best of Bollywood.""I don't like Shah Rukh Khan in many movies, since I have seen the films in the last few years, but this movie has so much that I love it. Also, they are two brothers, so it is more like brother-sister movie. It just works well. It is about family, about a love story, all that. I just like the plot, I like the family elements. It is a good time to watch Bollywood, it is just nice. It is not that bad. I liked the movie and it was a nice watch.""Shah Rukh Khan is good. He is the best in Hindi, he has so many hits but this is the first time I watch him. It is a very good movie."

(Photo/iStock/Thinkstock)What's your background? Your age? Are you a woman or a man? Are you married? Do you have a family? Do you have children?If you answered yes to any of those questions, you're more likely to commit suicide with a gun at your disposal.If you answered yes to all of them, you're more likely to attempt suicide at all.That's the conclusion of a new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In the report, the CDC states that "Suicide by firearm occurs at a higher rate than other kinds of suicide."More specifically, the CDC found that, for every 100,000 people who "suicide" by gun, about 12 other people attempt suicide by guns.Those were the findings from a new research report commissioned by the National Institute of Justice. The report analyzes the national trends in all suicides, whether "legal," self-inflicted or suicide.As noted this evening by the Guardian, "about 75 percent of all suicides in the US are committed using a firearm.""Every year, one person on average kills herself with a gun, and almost 14,000 people die from suicide with a firearm," notes USA Today."By the time we get through today, we will have heard from a dozen or more people who attempt to kill themselves with a gun," stated Rep. Louise Slaughter of New York in a statement issued earlier today. "The numbers speak for themselves — more gun laws won't stop a handful of people who intend to murder and die."She continued: "What has to work is commonsense gun ownership that's supported only by common sense."In that statement, she called for increased mental health services."This kind of tragedy reminds us that, while we have the most advanced mental health system in the world, we still have to make sure that these people get the help they need and don't slip through the cracks," she said.She then called for an end to the availability of assault weapons."A small number of guns that are available for purchase by law-abiding citizens are responsible for the majority of firearms-related homicides and suicides and we must take steps to increase enforcement on these guns," she said.

The man in the suit who was filmed in downtown Chicago being beaten Tuesday by a group of Chicago police officers will get a trial, the woman charged with assaulting him said.Shanna Brown confirmed the development in a telephone call with the Chicago Sun-Times on Tuesday.A Cook County judge set bail at $50,000 on the misdemeanor charges against the woman, 17-year-old Tyshawn Harris, and will hold a pretrial hearing on Wednesday.Chicago police said Wednesday afternoon that Chicago police Sgt. Kevin Shields and two other officers had been placed on paid administrative leave following the video's release.In the video, Harris is seen walking toward the building near Navy Pier around 3 p.m. Tuesday when the officers come up to him. The video shows one officer hitting Harris with his baton, but it does not show which officer does the hitting. The man then falls to the ground, before the officers pin and drag him to the ground. The footage goes blank briefly after both officers turn off the camera.The woman, identified by the Chicago Tribune as Tyshawn Harris, 17, is to be tried as an adult on felony charges of aggravated battery and misdemeanor charges of trespassing and battery.The two officers were placed on paid administrative leaves pending the outcome of the investigation, CPD spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said.Guglielmi earlier said no officers used less-than-lethal force, but Cook County State's Attorney Anita Alvarez's office said Harris' injuries were minor.Police said the incident began when officers responded to reports a fight was occurring in the 1100 block of W. Roosevelt Road. At the scene, they saw Harris walking alone on the block. They detained and questioned Harris, then decided to take him into custody after an "initial verbal encounter."Harris was then thrown to the ground and hit repeatedly with the baton and police officers punched him multiple times, punching him five times in the mouth and at least six times on the head and body, police said.The video showed that Harris wasn't resisting and the officers did not know he was recording the incident on his cellphone, police said. The victim was initially charged with resisting arrest; however, he was later released because prosecutors were unable to corroborate his description of the officers as attacking him, according a police report.The Chicago Police Association has said the officers weren't at fault during the incident."The video shows officers repeatedly hitting the victim in his head, breaking his eye socket, knocking him to the ground, punching and kicking him as well as punching and kicking him in the mouth," Chicago Police Association President Dean Angelo has said.Antonio and other members of officers' union have demanded the public release of the video.Anaheim Police Chief Dan Hughes said the department is reviewing the footage, and Hughes promised that the department will "take this very seriously," the Tribune reported.Alvarez's office said it doesn't know where the video came from or who shot the video."We cannot comment on the matter until all the information that we have is made available," Alvarez's office said.
I had just finished my interview with T.S. Eliot, my introduction to Modernism. There was, on the other hand, no mention of the literary genre that was on my mind, "realist," a very modern word in the English language. It wasn't because I was unfamiliar with the word, which has a long and distinguished history in our language, but because it wasn't part of the language of Modernism. Eliot had never, in my experience, considered the possibility that his fiction was in any sense "realist."This is something that a number of writers, notably Edmund Wilson and Philip Roth, had in mind when they wrote about his novels as they described in detail the ways in which fictional devices or devices of narrative were constructed that were in some sense "realistic." But to my knowledge, not a single one of them had ever actually read one of the novels for which they were writing that was in the broadest sense described as "realist."Now, it may have been Eliot's intention to avoid using this term. He may have thought that, like the other critics who have written about his novels, he was being very coy at best. But it seems a little odd to leave a significant, even novelistic and important literary term out of the conversation in a discussion that had been devoted nearly perfectly so far to discussing the novel itself. Perhaps it's possible that "realist," although a great literary genre in the English language, is too modern for us to be using so liberally. Perhaps it was part of a strategy to avoid criticism and to avoid attention for the genre. But, to my knowledge, it's never been clear either way where "realistic" fits. A few novels, not all of them great, don't fit that description at all. Some of them, like Joyce's Ulysses, make their characters into something like realist figures, but then, like most of the great literature of our time, they don't use a single character to describe every scene. They use characters to tell the story about a group of people, a group of events and a complex of circumstances that makes up the main narrative. These characters, unlike those in Eliot's stories, never have a point of view. The characters have only a general sense of what's happening: "A woman was walking down the street, with her head bent to listen to the radio." Some even have no memory of the event or experience but simply observe it, as in "A man was driving to a job interview, when he heard the television on and saw the girl in the window of the coffee shop and went past, not knowing who she was." And the narrative is always told in a sort of omniscient style, with events happening in a sequence that you can watch back and see, a sequence that the characters follow back to the beginning as they drive into town and begin to walk to the job interview together. There is no "this is fiction" here, although there are scenes that seem like they're part of some larger narrative."Realist" is so often taken to mean that the world is not a living organism, but is simply an object that is observed. It may seem obvious to begin as soon as a novel has the character or viewpoint that characterizes a "realist" writing but there is, at least within the Modernist tradition, a tendency to view the "realist" as someone who is a part of this organism or world in some way or another. But if this is the case, there is no reason why we cannot look to the other, modernist literature in order to get a sense of the way they make their characters come to be in such a "realistically" constructed and described world.There is, to cite another example, George Saunders's brilliant novel "Catch-22." Saunders is not "realistic." He has characters who don't speak for themselves, who have very limited views of the world around them. But Saunders, in a way, gets his main characters so right that they feel almost real. And it's a feeling more than anything resembling character. In Saunders's stories, there is a character known simply as, simply, "The Man." For Saunders, the idea of a person who knows everything is ludicrous. The Man is a blank slate, someone who does not, in fact, know anything. This is the central paradox of "Catch-22." The Man is trapped in a situation that he cannot escape from either of two equally impossible ways. He has to either commit his crimes to his death or risk, and presumably, commit, even worse crimes. There are no good options for him. He's the very definition of a prisoner of both of his impossible situations, a prisoner trapped in a kind of unchangeable prison. He is constantly surrounded by those who know about the nature of his fate or about his crimes, and he has no way of deciding which one he wants to be in and which he doesn't.
[+]Enlarge Routine checkups for patients with diabetes and hypertension can be lifesaving (left) while the cost of care is high (right), says an expert. Credit: ShutterstockThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) just put out a new recommendation: For diabetics, the average annual cost of diabetes care in the U.S. will be $30,300. For those with hypertension, it will be $44,450.That means that if you have high blood pressure and diabetes, you will spend an average of $6,900 on care annually for your condition, compared to about $6,000 for those without it.[+]Enlarge The costs of diabetes care for diabetics and hypertension. Credit: CDPHEThose numbers are not new, but the new CDC guidance addresses the question of whether they are appropriate or appropriate for patients, the experts writing the report note. They state that the average cost should be similar for diabetes and hypertension, even if a patient with diabetes has an increased risk of cardiovascular events.The new advice suggests "a higher level of routine checkups for all patients with type 1 and 2 diabetes and for all patients with hypertension in addition to increasing the number of clinical events per year from baseline" for all patients with diabetes and hypertension, says John S. Lee, M.D., a cardiologist at Kaiser Permanente San Francisco, and coauthor of the recent CDC report.The guidelines reflect the increasing number of patients with type 2 diabetes and hypertension, particularly in the U.S. The World Health Organization lists diabetes and hypertension as "emerging health problems."Diabetes represents 30% of the patients, with hypertension representing 15%. In the U.S., more than 2.1 million people had diabetes in the 2012–2013 year, and about 1,360 new cases of diabetes were diagnosed in the same period, the agency reports.To identify the most common primary-care issues, the CDC analyzed information from its 2011 National Health Interview Survey and other data sources regarding what patients with diabetes and hypertension commonly seek from their doctors. The CDC found that about 20% of patients with type 1 diabetes and 10% of those with type 2 diabetes are currently treated with diet and exercise programs, and 11% of those with hypertension also take some types of medication. Both of those groups also sought routine checkups and some of those were more likely to have high blood pressure, the CDC found.[+]Enlarge Diabetes and hypertension can have harmful effects on blood pressure. Credit: CDCThe new CDC guidelines say that routine checkups in diabetes patients are important for monitoring blood glucose levels. They do not say what type of checkups patients with hypertension should receive but have said that if blood sugar checks indicate that a patient already has pre-diabetes, they should ask about the risk of developing diabetes as well.Many patients with diabetes and hypertension do not have diabetes because their condition is not life-threatening, they say in the CDC report. Although this scenario, known as type 1 nondiabetic (NDI) diabetes, is relatively common, it does not represent true type 2 diabetes in anyone who goes on to develop the disease, the CDC authors write.
I am still having trouble posting. So much to add here, but it just has not worked. It's like a brick wall. But it's getting there! I want to tell you all that I am in full command of the ship in my own mind. My brain is now like a hummingbird with a full stomach, ready to fly and soar.My thoughts have changed.No longer am I a "weirdo". Now I am a warrior. And I am at peace!Please, please forgive me for not responding this weekend. I am writing from the heart here. I just was not feeling well. It's like someone has shoved me in a blender and set it on high for a couple of days. It's like my body is like a giant blender with too much soup. I can feel that with my very small toes. It makes me dizzy. But I have to keep going…. and so is the ship.Anyway, today I will tell you a few of the most amazing things that have happened.Today I went to the beach to see my friend, I was super nervous to meet these two so I didn't feel up for doing a lot of stuff. I was also feeling pretty down about the way that my mind was at me. So we went to the beach to cool off. The sun was so pretty, when we got there, the waves were so close to the shore. I thought it would be so fun to go surfing, even being a girl. I mean, being a girl and surfing! It felt exciting. And it was just perfect for me. It's like, just for me!We were just chilling there and I was thinking about how awesome it is that I am a girl out there, and that I am not afraid. And that was very refreshing, and all the guys were nice to me.We started surfing and it was just incredible. I'm not so sure anymore if I'm a girl. Because my mind just has a great time going to sleep! I can kind of be my whole life when I'm surfing! It's like… my whole life just gets wrapped up in that one moment. It's just everything in my life is totally connected. And then it just settles again. It's crazy.And then, oh yes. They caught me! Oh, it was so awesome! They got me and it all just worked perfectly. The adrenaline. The feeling of the adrenaline. My legs did something amazing as I just looked up. It was one of the most amazing feelings in the world. Being on that big wave I just did this. And it was just my arms and I just did that wave and the rest is history!Of course, I was super stressed after that and I thought that it had all been so good, like it was the best day ever. You know, I could've said "it was great" but when you feel so great that you could literally have died and you're like "It's so great!!" And then everything just settles. The waves calm down. The sun starts warming up again.We ended up surfing our final days for this trip that we went on! We went in the summer and it was a lot warmer. In the morning the waves were really powerful so we went surfing. That is one of my best memories… of all the wonderful beaches and the incredible surfers that we met in Southern California.

This mod includes more than just the ability to change the colors and patterns of clothing and the addition of more than a dozen new clothing. More new clothing in particular includes new boots, belts, helmets, body armor, and even some weapon mods!All of the modded clothes are craftable and are fully compatible with vanilla armors.CraftingSome of the mods use vanilla craft methods that you should be able to use, others require the latest version of either Blender or MMM and that probably means some tweaking. I recommend Blender 3.0+ for the best results.The mod has been tested and is compatible with this mod. If anything seems weird, please let me know.The mod only uses one mod loader for compatibility reasons, and that mod loader is version 7.0. If you are using previous versions (before 7.0) you will need to upgrade the mod loader with newer and newer versions.InstallationTo install use the NMM or the Manual Installer. If you choose the Manual Installer you will be prompted to download and install the latest version of the mod loader. It will NOT be automatically installed when it is downloaded; if it appears in your mod loader, you just need to install it manually.UninstallingTo uninstall simply delete the clothing folder that is inside each of the folders labeled - Clothing - Misc clothing (if desired)Version History1.4 - Added: New boot mod, belt, body armor, helmet with pauldrons- Added: New boots- Added: New pants- Added: New boots/boots- Added: New boot/boots- Added: New pants- Added: New belt, belt buckle- Added: New pants/pants/pants- Added: New belt, belt buckle- Added: New boots/boots- Added: New boots/boots- Added: New pants- Added: New pants- Added: New pants- Added: New pants- Added: New pants- Added: New pants- Added: New pants- Added: New boots/boots- Added: New boots/boots- Added: New boots/boots- Added: New pants- Added: New pants- Added: New pants- Added: New pantsVersion 1.3 - New: New boots and belts with new patterns and color styles- New: New boots and belt with new patterns and color styles - Added: New boots- Added: New boots- Added: New belt- Added: New pants- Added: New pants- Added: New pants- Added: New pants- Added: New pants- Added: New pants- Added: New boots- Added: New boots- Added: New boots- Added: New boots- Added: New boots- Added: New boots- Added: New pants- Added: New pants- Added: New pants- Added: New pants- Added: New pants- Added: New pants- Added: New pants- Added: New pants- Added: New pants- Added: New boots/boots- Added: New boots/boots- Added: New pants- Added: New pants- Added: New pants- Added: New boots- Added: New boots- Added: New pants- Added: New pants- Added: New pants- Added: New boots- Added: New boots- Added: New boots- Added: New pants- Added: New pants- Added: New pants- Added: New bootsVersion 1.2 - New: New boots (also available as a craftable in the workshop)- New: New boots are craftable in the workshop for a price.- New: New boots are available in the Workshop for a price.- Added: New pauldrons (both genders).- Added: New belts- Added: New belts are craftable in the workshop.- Added: New belts are available in the Workshop for a price- Added: New pants (both genders).- Added: New pants are craftable in the workshop for a price.- Added: New pants are available in the Workshop for a price- Added: New pants are available in the Workshop for a price- Added: New boots- Added: New boots are craftable in
This was very interesting to me...I'm a guy with a very unique history to that of many people. This is a piece I was commissioned to paint years ago. I got out of the picture a time or two after the sale and didn't want to take it on. However, I did find a picture of it and thought it would be fun to put into a poster and do it here. I think it looks pretty cool, it's got some great details on the armor, the mask and the cloak and the look is very unique. I've only seen photographs and had to look at the piece in person.It does not include the sword or shield, however they can be found in the sale if you are interested..I would also appreciate questions or comments regarding size/scale, etc.I did a bit of research on what exactly is on the shield. I would think it would fit the theme but could be of a much different scale or color. I also wouldn't be surprised if it had some sort of magical properties, possibly with the sword. I'm not a swords guy, I don't even know how swords work. But I had the honor of meeting the artist, and he said he thought it was quite cool. Anyways, here is the link for the artist I used.I hope you enjoy. It's only been a couple minutes but this piece is quite unique.
"A lot of people have seen the footage of the alleged attack [on the man's car] and they've said they want to move things forward," says a spokesperson for the Department for International Development (DFID)."We want to make sure there are safeguards in place in order for us to continue our work in the context of the current violence."More detail will be released at the end of September, when the report is due to be released.'Ceasefire needs strengthening'The spokesperson told Morning Report that there was no indication whatsoever of a security threat to Mr Ndlangalo when he was attacked."There was no indication that any civilians had been threatened."But, she said the ceasefire has "been put into place, has been adhered to, and [the] parties concerned need to ensure the ceasefire is strengthened"."They need to ensure that the military cease fire is enforced, both in the South and the North, and that the humanitarian ceasefire is maintained."While a South African government spokesman defended the government's handling of the attacks, he said there was "absolutely no cause" for the alleged reprisals.It was "totally inconsistent" to say that an innocent man was targeted on a Friday night while the ceasefire was being enforced on Saturday, he said."It is also inconsistent to say that the South African authorities are responsible for any violence on South African soil, while at the same time they themselves are being the target of violence," Mr Steenkamp told Morning Report.The South African government had "no responsibility" for the actions of its own citizens or the actions of its soldiers after the attacks, he added.'People need to know this is a ceasefire'The South African government initially described the attacks as unlawful attacks.At one point, President Jacob Zuma ordered an investigation. It's believed that the inquiry was halted in 2013 due to the risk to the integrity of the investigation.The president has spoken of his disgust at the violence between his country's northern border and the northern-most state of Natal.
Mozilla is planning an open API for Firefox to support cross-origin requests, according to a project roadmap posted on the foundation's developer site.Developer Matthew Deering, a member of the Mozilla Foundation's project management team, said in the roadmap summary that Mozilla was considering a mechanism through which developers could build apps that use other people's web pages and applications."Mozilla thinks we can make it work, but we need to gather some feedback," he said. "We still need to build a solid foundation for this feature — something to make it easy and clear how it'll work."Mozilla has made open APIs a top priority in recent years, with new features like Gecko Nightly and Servo to come. In addition, the company said in September that it planned to implement native cross-origin request capabilities in its Firefox OS and Mozilla-based mobile devices. "We're starting off with very simple mechanisms, where the client can just use your page, but we expect to add a variety of techniques and capabilities over time," Jay Sullivan, vice president of development at Mozilla, said at the time.As it stands, Mozilla Firefox supports cross-origin requests internally via a user agent that can handle requests with a variety of origins. The most likely candidate for implementing the open API is the WebSocket API, which would allow developers to send data from one web page to another and to set up the necessary permissions.Deering said Firefox had been testing this type of capability for about two years. He said Firefox engineers had been working on this work for more than six months. In September, Mozilla released a technical preview build of Firefox with the WebSocket capability in place."With WebSockets, cross-origin requests can be done using the existing network layer, but there is still a fair amount of work that needs to be done on how to handle the client side of all the different kinds of headers, and how to build APIs to access them, and how to work with third parties," he said.The open API proposal would not require WebSocket as its only transport, Deering said. In order to do cross-origin requests, browser vendors would need to implement the APIs they provide.The API would also be compatible with other protocols that Firefox supports. Currently, Mozilla includes the Session API, HTML5 Media Element API, Cookies, and Media Playback in the list that it defines as "essential." This list can be amended."At this point, the only important thing to consider is that it's completely up to the client to make sure these protocols are allowed in the page," Deering said. "You'll still be able to do other things on a page without having to add cross-origin requests to your page. But once you add an event handler to use one of these protocols, you'll need to make sure that other scripts can't override it or stop it from working."Deering declined to specify an expected timeline for the work. "We're not going to just roll it out a bunch of times," he said. "It's something we are planning for. There needs to be a lot of work to make it a consistent experience in Firefox and other browsers."Updated May 27, 7:43am PT with Mozilla's timeline for implementing the API.
"We are now back under attack from our own government," Riedl said. "With President Trump, we have the potential for all sorts of chaos because of his incompetence and because of the fact he thinks the world should bend to his will," he added.
For years, the U.S. government has waged war on the Internet. It has threatened to shut down the Web under questionable legal authority, sought and fought in court to keep online pornography away from children, and pressured the FCC to turn all its regulatory power over to the big Internet, giving it powers to control virtually all aspects of the Web's operation and growth.So it didn't come as much of a surprise when it was discovered in August that Russia, the Soviet Union and Cuba were the three countries with the lowest percentages of their citizens using the Internet in 2013. For those three countries Internet penetration rates hovered around 1 percentage point or less. Meanwhile, Western Europe had a 4- to 5-percentage point-plus increase in Internet users.In 2013, the number of active Internet users in the U.S. was estimated at 3.5 million. Even though the total number of Internet users isn't expected to exceed 4.6 million, it's worth noting that, in many areas, it will be well over 8.5 million users for all the people in the country who aren't currently users.The U.S. government has been fighting its war to protect the Internet from the rest of the world for years. It is currently at a stalemate with China when it comes to Internet censorship and control, especially when it comes to social media. But despite all the U.S.'s efforts to control the Internet, some countries are now following Russia's lead and trying to put the government into the business of controlling it.In 2010, China unveiled its "National Internet Development Strategy." The document, which lays out a vision for the country's future on the web, is remarkably detailed and ambitious. For the first time, China outlined how it will transform the way it engages with the world on the Internet, and what its role will be in that transformation. The Chinese government has also been working on the problem of Internet infrastructure. In 2010, the state-owned China Telecom announced a massive plan to create a national cyber-power grid. It has also been attempting to create a national e-payment system for online transactions.But a recent report by The New York Times shows that China's "National Internet Development Strategy" may prove to be the most dangerous threat to the Internet. The report warns China is trying to gain control over the entirety of the Web, from the basic infrastructure of the World Wide Web to the applications that power the Internet.If a nation were to exert control over an entire industry, the Internet, it would have far-reaching and far-reaching repercussions. This is because any nation's ability to control information online would allow the entire country's political and economic activity and business to be shaped by decisions made at the state-like level."The Internet has been used as a political tool, to push back against censorship and to support dissidents in repressive regimes to the detriment of those regime," said Ben Scott, the author of the book, "The New Internet," and editor of Politico Magazine. "It is very much about the control of information."China's "National Internet Development Strategy" is very similar to that of Russia, Cuba and other nations that are seeking to exert total control of the Internet.China's "National Internet Development Strategy" has five different stages, and Scott said the goal is to take one area of Internet service and completely replace it with Chinese standards."That way, all Internet applications, all the traffic that's going in and out of the country, would be done on the Chinese platform and controlled by Chinese Internet authorities, and if you want to send money, you go to the bank of China and you don't get any money back, and it works exactly the same," he said.China has taken a similar approach to creating its national e-payment system. According to the Times report, China is planning to create a national e-payments system that will replace the existing American payment system, called credit cards, with its own payment system."In China, everybody will be using credit cards," Scott said.In its pursuit to control the Internet, China has been using a technique previously used by its Soviet and Russian predecessors. Russia launched the "Northeast Internet Research Center" in 2007, and according to Scott, the goal was to build a "black belt" in terms of computer security.He says the focus then was to build computers that were extremely hard to crack that would make it extremely difficult to get anywhere online. He describes it as a very aggressive sort of effort that was extremely secretive and aimed at building a state-run computing enterprise to attack the American market.But it turns out that for the NSA and its allies, the biggest threat in this area is the government, not the hackers. Scott says that is because the government has the tools and resources to find all these black belts and make it difficult for even private companies to operate with the degree of security
The FBI and the New York Police Department released a video Saturday showing three men who robbed a convenience store in Queens in 2013.The men robbed the 7-Eleven cash register at about 8:30 p.m. on Dec. 16, 2013, at a shopping center off of West 137th Street in Forest Hills. They left with $1,000 in cash and later gave themselves back to police, according to police.The footage, obtained through a search warrant, shows three men standing outside in dark hooded sweatshirts as a clerk opens the register. The clerk is holding a cash bag over his head and the camera zooms in to see three men stealing the money and entering the store.The men are all between 21 and 37 years old.Anyone in the area who may have witnessed this incident is urged to call the NYPD's Crime Stoppers Hotline at 800-577-TIPS.
In the past few years, scientists have come to believe that the Earth's climate is, if not "normal," then certainly somewhat abnormal. The effects of this natural variability appear to be increasing every year, and scientists have concluded that the current warming trend of around 0.2°C per decade "exceeds the natural variability of the global climate and is likely unprecedented over the past millennium."To help further their understanding of such phenomena, scientists have increasingly turned to the study of "natural variability." This is a fancy term that refers to the fact that any given year can contain a variety of weather phenomena — some of which are beneficial and others of which are harmful. For instance, the number of days with clear skies in a given year can vary according to how strong a hurricane's wind is when it's brewing. The number of days with wind chill, combined with the wind speed, all contribute to the average temperature on the ground — thus determining the difference between a typical winter and even a typical spring.And while many of these natural weather events are beneficial for humans, such as increased rainfall and wind in the wake of heavy rainfalls, researchers are quick to point out that some of these phenomena are quite detrimental to human life.A good example of this occurred during the 2009 winter months when severe cold weather (wind chill) hit northern Germany for extended stretches. A winter storm that swept through the German capital of Berlin in February and March caused an unprecedented wave of death and injury from the cold.The National Climate Assessment report, which was released by the Trump Administration, is no exception. According to the study, this year's Arctic warming is due to "an increase in solar radiation reaching the Earth's surface."While most global warming researchers now believe that human-induced warming over the past century is at least partly attributable to global warming due to emissions from the burning of coal, oil, and natural gas, a number of researchers still maintain that human-induced warming by itself cannot account for the vast, rapid increase in global average temperatures over this period of time — which has been identified as the result of a natural, human-initiated increase in solar radiation reaching Earth's surface."The rate of temperature change [over the past century] is higher than the rate of change that is normally occurring," wrote Michael Mann, of Pennsylvania State University, in a 2016 article. "It's not an upward or downward trend, but in a statistically significant pattern. If nothing else, it's hard to understand how it could be any other way."Despite this conclusion, many climate scientists continue to believe the impact of human-induced warming on the climate is too small to cause serious harm, and that even though a warming trend certainly did occur over the past century, it will likely stop sometime in the future — possibly in the future election cycle.
Pizza Hut is recalling its popular Thin Mints chocolate-chip cookie dough variety because they may contain trace amounts of listeria.The dough has the letters "TM", "TM2", "TM3", "TM4", "TM5" on it.The food company said on its web site Monday that it is recalling approximately 19.7 metric tons of unpackaged thin mints manufactured at its plant in Lacey, Washington, as well as other U.S. locations.Those unpackaged products may be affected by any of three separate incidents that occurred between February and April. The incidents have tested positive for Listeria monocytogenes.Consumers who bought one of the affected products are advised to throw it away, or return it for a full refund.
"We were all on our own trying to figure out who the hell we're dealing with," said Jason, a co-owner of Oskar Blues Brewery in Longmont.The Denver company that produces the original Oskar Blues Brewery in Longmont, CO has been sold to a group including three former Oskar Blues co-founders – Pete Pease, Dale Katechis and Dale Katechis's wife, Nancy.A spokesman for the Colorado-based brewery said the deal is expected to close as early as October 12.The three, however, will not sell the company.According to a statement by Pease, "We will keep our Colorado headquarters and production operations, and we plan to continue to make beers brewed in Colorado in a similar way to the way a craft brewer would in an established craft-brewing town. We are going to use their expertise to help expand our beer production footprint and grow and develop new brands across the country. Those brands will be distributed to a number of distributors, and we expect that will happen within the next 2-4 years – all in a way that is similar to the ways craft beer is distributed, and we expect to use our own distribution expertise to maximize the experience of those consumers."On top of all of that, the news comes a week after Pease announced plans to build a brewery in the Denver area. And as The Denver Post points out, the Colorado-based brewery "was the state's largest employer in the 1950s and 60s," with 740 people employed locally during the height of the Great Depression.Oskar Blues closed its Longmont location back in 2010 amid a massive recession of the beer segment. Since then, the brewery focused on its Longmont brewery, an all-new production facility, and expanding its distribution across the United States and the world. Pease and his team, including President, Product Development and Brand Acquisition, Steve Lage (who has been with the company since its inception) have gone on to work on the company's flagship brews that sold out in record time.Now, the brewery's "sales are back," a spokeswoman for the company has confirmed – and the number of Longmont beer geeks who eagerly anticipate their next batch of Oskar Blues beer has only grown."Our beer sales are back," Karen Lusk told Denver7 News in a recent interview. "We have been selling beer on a pretty steady basis for three summers now."She continued by saying the brewery has been working on the new Longmont facility for years, including preparing for its opening in the fall of 2013. The project will be complete by August 2014, Lusk said."We've had this thing called Oskar Blues for a really long time and really it just hasn't been ready," Lusk said.As the Longmont shop has been closed since 2010, they will continue the distribution model, with select stores still seeing regular shipments, Lusk said.Oskar Blues did not disclose the sale price or the names of potential investors.The three-generation team of Pease, Katechis and Katechis "have been with the company through its founding, its growth and the many ups and downs in this incredible industry," according to the statement issued by the company. The statement also noted that "the founders wanted to make sure they could continue to contribute to the success of the company at this time."The company is expected to continue manufacturing beer in Colorado "in a way that is similar to the way a craft brewer would in an established craft-brewing town."To date, 13 beer-makers have purchased the Oskar Blues Brewery, and it will continue this pattern going forward, Pease said.In the statement Pease wrote, "In the time we have spent developing our beer, which is a very long time, we have learned a bunch about craft brewing, brewing, marketing and distribution. We also got to learn a lot about being a business, which is something that goes with being an entrepreneur in the world of craft beer."Pete and Dale Pease also own the other 11 breweries and wineries in Longmont, Colo., including Ballast Point Brewing Company, Dry Dock Brewing Company, Lost Coast Brewing Company and Oskar Blues Brewery.
FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski says that the commission plans to take action against Comcast for slowing down and blocking downloads using BitTorrent.Genachowski made the comment at an industry gathering at the MoffettNathanson research group in Pasadena, Calif.'s Westwood Village neighborhood on October 24. As the FCC chairman was discussing his FCC plan to create better regulations for the cable industry and to boost competition as broadband adoption increases, he said he planned to take action toward Comcast."They may have broken the law, yes, but they've also broken our rules," wrote Genachowski.Comcast customers who download large files of copyrighted material are usually subject to the company's so-called "tolling" policy, according to Genachowski. Under the policy, downloads that exceed the company's monthly quota, resulting in slowed-down speeds, would result in a customer being slapped with a disconnection notice.Genachowski was describing what the FCC is doing to address the problem of ISPs throttling traffic at peak hours to reduce the amount of data the company's customers consume. To date, the FCC has been able to get an injunction preventing three major ISPs, Verizon, Time Warner Cable and Charter Communications, from imposing limits on BitTorrent as part of a settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice earlier this year. The FCC then made it easier for smaller ISPs to get similar injunctions.Comcast, however, has argued that it only throttles BitTorrent traffic during times when the company needs to prioritize high-speed customers' download traffic over lower-bandwidth ones."This is not just my opinion. I know this to be the case as we are the only company throttling traffic for BitTorrent for this very purpose," Genachowski wrote.Comcast has also argued that the lawsuit that settled with the DOJ was a "one-sided settlement" without being sufficiently comprehensive as to provide the FCC the authority it needed to investigate and regulate the ISPs with regard to BitTorrent.A senior FCC official told Wired a settlement with Comcast would include a statement that the company "deems it has the responsibility to manage congestion of 'high-cost, high-bandwidth data applications' like BitTorrent so that service providers like Comcast can continue providing broadband service to consumers on a modern, broadband-enabled infrastructure."One option being explored to combat BitTorrent traffic is to apply the same kinds of traffic congestion management methods the company is using, according to Genachowski."The question is would the commission need to do anything about this?" the FCC Commissioner told reporters at MoffettNathanson. "If it did, we want to make sure we address it in the right way."
SINGAPORE - A court heard details of the alleged rape of an Indonesian maid - at the same time as her employers, in the presence of her husband and neighbours - in a high rise flat.Tahirah, 28, who has been in Singapore for six months and is working as a domestic helper, faces a maximum sentence of 12 years' jail but, if convicted, she can be jailed for more than 12 years under the Immigration Act.The trial began today, at the Central District Court Complex, where prosecutors outlined the case against Tahirah.She faced charges under the Immigration Act, which carries a maximum maximum sentence of three years' jail.Taslimah - who cannot be named for legal reasons - was allegedly raped by her employer, Mohamed Elibiary Al-Hamad Al-Yazidi, at the couple's high rise flat in Upper Thomson Road, where she was working.According to the prosecution, Tahirah was subjected to forced sexual intercourse six times from May 8, 2014, to July 20 last year.But on Aug 5, 2014, when Tahirah's husband returned home from work, Al-Yazidi and three of her accomplices, who lived in the flats at the same building, allegedly abducted Tahirah, and brought her to a second place, at the nearby Parson Road in Upper Thomson Road.There, the defendants allegedly took Tahirah into a bathroom, where Al-Yazidi's accomplices then allegedly raped Tahirah.On the night of July 20 last year, the defendants allegedly raped Tahirah, before throwing her unconscious body on the roof of the second flat, where she was discovered the next day.In their final argument last night, Al-Yazidi's lawyers alleged that the prosecution had failed to prove in court that Tahirah had been raped by her employer.They argued that there were reasons to believe that Al-Yazidi and the two accomplices were in the flat at the time the accused was there, as they were there on the occasion the sexual assault took place.They also said that the prosecution's evidence showed that Al-Yazidi gave her consent to the act by giving a false "no" in their second encounter.A defence lawyer, though, noted that the court would not be able to rule upon the matter if the evidence was not heard.But on Tuesday, Judge Mr Michael Chia Sze Wai-cheng said: "I'm worried about this case - I don't know how it's going to end up."Judge Chia said he "found the evidence difficult to make out".For the offence, the maximum punishment is a maximum of three years' jail.Tahirah's defence lawyer, Mr Joseph Leong Yew Chee, said her case "needs much further investigation".This does not make her guilty of the crime, he added.If the case continues, she could be considered for the lighter sentence, Mr Leong noted.
Faced with increasing resistance by their constituents to any new laws that regulate the Internet, major Internet companies recently teamed up to launch the Open Internet Coalition (OIC), a non-profit organization with an eye on pushing the legislation into law. But is the coalition going to be able to actually force the United States Congress to take a stand by demanding that the Internet be kept open?Last week, I attended the OIC summit in Washington, D.C., the first in a series of meetings held by the new group. As part of the summit's agenda, the group announced their plan to push federal lawmakers to pass legislation called the Open Internet Rule, which will prevent ISPs from creating fast lanes and slow lanes of services based on the websites subscribers choose to access.The proposed rules were released last January, and have languished in the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) for the last year in what the group calls a "distressed process". But the effort by major Internet companies to force the FCC to act appears to have gained momentum over the last few weeks.The fight is not going away any time soon. Many lawmakers have already expressed their dissatisfaction with the regulatory system. Many Republicans in Congress have called for reform in favor of a free and open Internet. In addition to the Open Internet Rule, the FCC is also considering "net neutrality" policies aimed at protecting consumers and promoting innovation.Meanwhile, the federal agency that's supposed to police Internet providers for blocking or throttling Internet traffic is expected later this month to rule out new net neutrality rules.As the Open Internet Coalition pushes for changes in the net neutrality regulations, lawmakers will have an opportunity take a stand against the industry's push for more centralized control over online information. "If Congress does not pass legislation, then the OIC plans to take action via advocacy," says the OIC."The OIC is a clear example of why we need to have a truly bipartisan approach to regulating the Internet," says Kevin Zeese, an organizer for Popular Resistance and former president of the now-defunct Public Knowledge. "We already know how to do this in the states: we passed common sense net neutrality laws in Colorado, Connecticut; and many other states, including Maine, are doing the same; and it is only Congress that does not have a clear legislative solution."While the OIC is not the first to try this route to forcing Congress to solve the issue of net neutrality rules, the fact that major Internet companies are joining forces to make a case that the laws should be changed is notable. The new coalition is made up of the top five biggest Internet companies — Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon and eBay — as well as several trade associations representing them.Zeese agrees. "This is the most serious example of the convergence of companies that believe there should be a level playing field for Web content. This group of companies has a large stake in keeping the Internet open. And if Congress does nothing to enforce the existing rules, then we're poised to see a large new lobbying effort to change the FCC's mind," he said. (Read more: The Open Internet Coalition Is a Huge Deal for The Internet Industry )One area where the groups' proposal aligns with the public is that they want the rules to apply to fixed and mobile networks alike, and prevent Internet providers from prioritizing one user over another. While the Internet can only achieve so many billions of bytes of traffic a second, it is the fastest growing sector of the U.S. economy, with some 90 percent of all data consumed online now consumed in mobile devices.Although the industry does not see the new coalition as an attack on its interests, they are worried that the coalition will be more effective in pressuring Congress to enact net neutrality regulations if they can convince lawmakers that their arguments are solid and are supported by the data. "If anything, this coalition will make your voices heard more because it's likely the members of Congress will have to weigh in on these issues more often," says Zeese.With so much support for net neutrality from Google, Facebook, Microsoft and other prominent companies, it's a safe bet that a net neutrality fight is coming. And Congress would be wise to listen: the Internet companies behind the coalition are ready to push it when Congress actually does take up the issue. (Read more: Net Neutrality's Biggest Lobbyist Is You )And even though the coalition plans to keep a low profile until the rule is adopted by the FCC, I can't help but wonder what would happen if such a public outcry led Congress to act. After all, it's not like Congress is very concerned about regulating the Internet. After all, the same lawmakers opposed to President Barack Obama's 2009 effort to enact net neutrality into federal law did not see the need to oppose President Obama's push for more stringent federal oversight of the telecommunications industry in 2012."If the OIC is successful, we'll see a lot more pressure on Congress and other
We are in the home stretch of the 2015 NFL season. We are just about a month away from the conclusion of each NFL week.We have some players who have been great for their team, some that have disappointed, and some that have not done enough. The Patriots have a solid depth chart that will be tough to beat this week in the Colts.

This morning, after almost 6 years, we are starting an independent organization to publish information about the U.S. national security state as it is – not according to government wish-lists or the desires of government managers and their appointees, but as it is.The New American first published the first four volumes – called The Shadow Factory – to expose the extensive and highly questionable ways the U.S. government and its intelligence services collect information about the American people. Our first volume was called War on Terror and Terror Networks: A Primer for the 21st Century, and it detailed the widespread, highly illegal, and highly unconstitutional programs to spy and "monitor" Americans and others around the world that are revealed, documented, and publicly discussed in the original four volumes.It is with mixed feelings, but also with great hope, that we announce the beginning of a new era of publication for these vital details by independent investigative journalists. This will be a two-fold effort, as we hope to expand our existing investigative reporting team into an independent organization that can help sustain and deepen their efforts on this important subject. The New American Foundation website will become an important resource to help the American public understand as the government's official explanation for these deeply troubling activities – that these programs are directed at protecting the nation from terrorism.In the next few short months – at maximum – you, our readers, will have a real opportunity to directly participate in the debate, as we will publish articles, investigative stories, and opinion pieces by both established and new authors who investigate in depth the activities that the government has carried out for the past decade and beyond. These investigations will help build our reporting program to a scale that is commensurate with the scale of information uncovered over the past six years, and should allow Americans an opportunity to engage in a real debate over the most important issues of the day.This program, while designed to help build the new foundation for independent national security journalism, will also help establish the foundation for the New American Foundation. At this stage, we are in discussions about funding, and you, our readers, can help us find the proper path forward:If you wish to contribute to this important investigative research project, please do so here:https://secure.newamericanfoundation.org/contributeWe can't begin this effort without you. Without your generous contributions, we won't be able to maintain and promote this important information. Please help us make this program a reality!
In the past 24 hours, there have been 5,567 murders in London - the largest number for a single date in the city's history.Here's a look at the most violent nights ever recorded by the Metropolitan Police and the most dangerous roads in London:January 15 - 25, 2005More than 100 people were stabbed to death in London throughout the evening. Two people were killed on the South Bank of the Thames, while three people died on the Charing Cross Road in central London. The worst night of the riots also saw the biggest number of traffic accidents in British history, with 1,637 people being injured.
A year or so ago, I wrote this article for one of my websites, about the ways in which some of the more prominent members of the New Atheism movement are actually conservative. At the time, I was not an atheist myself, so I was not sure what to think of the article or of the people who wrote it, so I asked them. The result was interesting, to say the least.To start:This was a pretty large collection of folks who felt that they were taking on a task they felt strongly about, but who didn't understand as much as their fellow citizens on the political spectrum about why they would feel that way. Some of the responses were good and some were not so good–in part, these might depend upon when you were a young person, but also on a lot of other factors as well–so we'll leave it at this:If you're a young (or youngish) human/human-being reading this article, I'll ask you to put yourself in the shoes of a representative of the majority of people in the world. (I would assume not a person who has spent 20 or so years as an American citizen or resident, or even a person who is fluent in the language other than English, so I think most people in the U.S. or in the world are on the same page.) We all want to be treated the same, to be treated fairly. If you don't think you're being treated fairly, if you feel that your life is really hard and complicated, then you may become frustrated with what you perceive as a lack of recognition, or you just may leave. It's all very possible.If you're a member of another group in our society – such as, perhaps, a member of the Jewish establishment who has seen a lot of what happens there around the holidays and you're just not feeling all that comfortable anymore with the Jewish people, and/or perhaps a member of another group who has been brought up with a very different set of ideals about the role of religion in society, or perhaps a believer who was raised religious but has grown to understand that there are a lot of bad things that come with being religious, or a human who identifies as anything but Christian – well, you are probably doing the same thing that you've just read, and not much else. You may be frustrated and feel alienated and angry, but maybe you are also looking for help from some of the people around you.I've been thinking about this article since I wrote it recently. There are some things I want to add, but I first want to offer my sincere thanks to a very good friend and colleague at the site, who has been so amazing at the last few years of writing for me. His name is Sean Parnell. Sean's been writing for the site for over a decade in a series that has become a little more mainstream, so he's more closely identified with me personally than with any other member of the staff. (To put it another way, I'd like to take this opportunity to publicly thank Sean for his work on my book, because it is simply amazing.)Sean, in an email, mentioned that in 2006 he and I were part of a conference of New Atheists being held in San Francisco. There, we had a conversation, one day in January, in which he suggested that it might be a good idea for people who thought they were leaving the religion in which they'd been raised to consider whether that was just a convenient way of saying, "I've left the religion, I don't give a damn whether it works out."I thought this was a very interesting observation, and not just because it was a useful thought, but because it was a wonderful compliment to an essay written almost exactly a decade before by John Loftus, who had just done a similar comparison. Sean explained to me that John was a very intelligent man, one of the smartest men I've had the good fortune to know, but that he was also someone whose brain was very much on display–he talked a lot and he was very outspoken about a lot of very important and challenging points about people who he'd met. It wasn't an accident, I think, how intelligent John was and how outspoken he was.As both a friend and a colleague, Sean was generous to me with his thoughtful and insightful responses to my recent comments, and I'm so grateful to him that we share a mutual friend, Sean Parnell.Sean has a very nice piece about this on the website of the American Atheists, where you can read about his reaction to my article on the New Atheism movement (as a new convert to atheist ideas rather than a convert to humanism). Also, of course, read Sean's response to my own thoughts about religious people.
The government has agreed to allow companies to use a "two-tier internet" system in which the poorest could pay for data.Under the deal, ISPs, including BT and Virgin Media, would be able to offer data at a cheaper rate for "ultra-low income households" or people on pensions, incapacity benefit, disability benefits and tax credits.The move is designed to stimulate a digital economy that grew 0.6% last year, the smallest annual growth since 2008.An inquiry commissioned by the government, which includes the Conservative MP Julian Smith, said the two-tier system would be "far more affordable than providing broadband to every household".Image: The £4.3bn Broadband Delivery UK programme aims to give homes and businesses speedy broadbandThe UK's six major ISPs had been lobbying to exempt themselves from the scheme, the BBC reported, amid fears that a move to a 'fibre-to-the-basement' broadband scheme that did not charge extra for the data may be a "catastrophe" for consumers.The industry says it pays £1bn to £2bn a year in infrastructure costs to deliver high speed broadband to most homes in Britain.BT added the deal would "provide a fairer and more affordable service to every home and business" and would mean more people were able to get access to broadband and social media.However, campaigners said it was "wrong" to try to remove competition in the sector."It is about time we got rid of the barriers to competition rather than encouraging barriers to opportunity," said Stephen Bates, policy and advocacy director at consumer website Which."A two-tier system is the kind of approach that is causing too many broadband consumers to pay more and have less choice than is justified," he added.The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) said: "We want British consumers to have more choice and have greater speeds."This can only be achieved if all broadband providers are able to offer the most suitable service to their customers on the best, most affordable basis.Image: The coalition has previously tried to bring back competition in the telecoms sector"This is the first stage of a wider review of the telecoms market, which we are working to bring forward as a matter of urgency."Critics of the government plan have argued it would mean broadband providers would raise subscription charges for some, leaving other customers of the same provider higher up the bills.A government-commissioned paper from the Commons' business and technology committee said that a 2GB cap could increase broadband and mobile services costs.Data used by the services could cost up to £20 per month, and in areas where the cost rises more steeply, a 2GB cap might well apply, it warned.The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said: "It's simply not right that some customers pay more than others for the same service."As ISPs will see this legislation in the coming weeks, our aim is to give all British consumers an affordable way to get the best deal for their business and on their families."More than half (62%) of UK adults use a broadband connection to connect to the web, and 55% are not covered by a fibre-based broadband network such as BT's, according to a new study.
"As our country's most populous state, California will play a key role in determining the future of the country and its citizens," Mr. Davis said.Democrats had tried to make the case that Republicans' refusal to expand the health care law by defunding Planned Parenthood would deprive millions of women of preventive services, including breast exams and cancer screenings, the first step in preventive care before diseases develop. But the House has not yet voted on the bill.But Mr. Davis said some of those services might be covered anyway. "I know that it was the intent of the House" to defund Planned Parenthood, "but there are a number of things that don't need full defunding, and certainly we need contraception. And so, you know, that's where our focus will be."Republicans say the government will not be able to afford that. "What we're talking about doing is not sustainable given current budgets," said Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma.Representative Trent Franks of Arizona suggested on Fox News that defunding Planned Parenthood might even put California's economy at risk. "I think it will probably put California's economy at risk and we could lose a lot of companies over there," he said.The vote had been called after President Obama, speaking in San Francisco, vowed that California would not "walk away" from federal programs like the 2010 health care law. His office said Ms. Pelosi's office encouraged all Democrats to vote "no," with its message that the party is united in its opposition to the Republican effort.
When a woman falls in love with a handsome stranger on the internet, she's usually going to get dumped pretty quickly, right? Not always.In this clip from the film, I Dream of Jeannie, a young woman is approached by a man who calls himself her "true love," but in reality it's just another creep who's taking advantage of her vulnerability.WATCH:The "cougar" tries to woo the 22-year-old and convince her to meet in his apartment, where they have sex. It goes poorly at first, but the woman eventually decides she's going to have to get real and find someone who's actually going to treat her right, as a good man always should."A woman's a woman. All right? I mean, we all need to understand that," one of the men trying to woo the woman says. "The way we think about love. The way we think about men is that we're all going to have to get over our issues, and get over ourselves and stop being so needy. You know? That's a big problem when it comes down to it."When it comes down to it, the woman is a decent human being, and she just doesn't understand that you can't just ask women for sex to make them feel good -- she's human, too, and she knows that it's not the way that the majority of men think.But the "true love" guy is relentless, and despite his best efforts to impress her, he can't bring her back down to Earth. He keeps trying to change her mind, but she just can't understand his way of thinking."The problem is I'm not falling in love that way. I don't think that's what you're doing," the woman says. "You're putting words in my mouth, and you're making me feel something, and that's not true love, that I know is."After her breakup with a guy, the woman has a bit of a breakdown, eventually leaving him entirely."Well you can't just call somebody out on everything, because it just takes away from how much you want to be with that person," the man says, after realizing that he's gone too far. "Sometimes there are ways that you can tell. There's people who have all these signs that you look at that say, 'Oh, she's really interested.' You just can't tell that to everybody."So, after she's dumped him in the end, how does the woman end up dating this guy? That's where the real drama begins -- and it's an absolute mess! The "true love" guy gets a few hours in the spotlight and even comes at the woman with what she thought had been his true love in him.The woman, having never been with a guy who's not at least somewhat attractive, doesn't buy his story at all and is disgusted by what she's been sold."I could have been his mother," the woman says. "I could have been his wife to be honest. I could have been his girlfriend to be dishonest. All I cared about was that he was going to treat me right."At the end, the woman gives up on the "true love" guy and meets "his truth" in a bar. What an absolute bummer... and a lesson for how women can really end up feeling about the man of their dreams if they're just given the wrong idea, and not treated with respect.
ROME/MEXICO CITY, June 22 (Reuters) - A Mexican congressman on Wednesday said U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's comments about Mexicans being drug addicts and rapists was "racist," adding any candidate for president should apologize and refrain from such rhetoric."We cannot tolerate the word that's said to our country by the candidates for the presidency of the United States of America and that's what a racist means," U.S. Representative Joaquin Castro was quoted as saying by local television station Notimex.In a televised interview on Fox News Channel earlier in the day, Trump said Mexico was sending rapists and drug dealers to the United States and called Mexican immigrants from the United States "rapists.""We have some bad hombres here and we're going to get them out," he said.The remark drew protests in Mexico and prompted the mayor of Mexico City's financial district to say Mexico City residents "will never ever vote for a candidate who makes racist comments."Trump has since called off the planned speech, saying late on Tuesday he would give his Mexican counterpart more time to apologize."I think the most important thing is (that) he will never say another racist, sexist, sexist comment because this is the most important election in history and he knows his image in Mexico and I hope he doesn't continue to do this," Castro told Notimex."If you start using that language against women and African Americans, against other people that you would never use it in a campaign but then you become very successful, it is not a way to run a country," he said.Castro, 38 and co-chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, said he personally believed Trump to be a "honest person" who had been subjected to the "gifts and bad seeds of intolerance."But Castro said Trump's comments on Mexicans were not in line with how Mexicans viewed the candidate."I think what he did is racist," Castro said of Trump. "The kind of language that he used is racist."
MILAN - It was not a good year for Italy's national men's team, where a 4-0 loss to Belgium, a 2-2 draw with Honduras, and a loss to Colombia all led to a 2.75 point fall from third place to seventh place overall in the 2014 FIFA World Cup™ qualifiers.While the loss of the two points by losing two games to Belgium and Honduras in November still hurt, they were not the biggest losses. Italy's second-place finish in the 2014 FIFA Confederations Cup™ in Brazil was also disappointing, as the Azzurri fell in the quarter-finals to the hosts, Ecuador. However, the Azzurri could have earned a result at the group stage if they beat Mexico in San Salvador, where Italy and Mexico played at the last two World Cups.Nevertheless, Italy continued to play a competitive World Cup qualifier in Italy and qualified for their fourth straight World Cup final (2009-present). While it remains to be seen whether they will do so again, coach Antonio Conte's side may be disappointed with their showing in Brazil and will have a new face leading their national team squad in 2014.For this year's new team, they chose an experienced squad, including two youngsters, which has been added to their squad for the upcoming season which starts in September/October. In their squad, the Azzurri have an Italian and an Italian-American and one player from Uruguay in the group stage.In addition to the above mentioned players, Italy will not have any player who has played in the previous finals in either 2005 or 2010, but they have many players who have a World Cup experience on their resumes, including:Goalkeepers: Gianluigi BuffonDefenders: Leonardo Bonucci, Leonardo Bonucci, Daniele De Rossi, Alessandro Diamanti and Paolo CannavaroMidfielders: Francesco Totti, Domenico Criscito, Mario Balotelli, Fabio Galli, Andrea Pirlo, Marco Verratti.Attackers: Andrea Pirlo (Italy), Claudio Marchisio (Italy), Mario Balotelli (Italy), Antonio Cassano (Italy)."We must be careful because we don't have players that played in the 2010 and 2005 finals, but we have many players who have been at the World Cup, like Domenico Criscito who scored the winning goal against Mexico. I hope that this combination will be a big one for us because we have a very talented squad," Conte told Gazzetta dello Sport.On the international level, Italy has not been able to qualify for the final eight for the past five tournaments in the round of 16 (2009-present) and the quarter-finals (2005-2010). The team is currently in seventh place in the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualifying rankings (with 24 points).
The UESPWiki – Your source for The Elder Scrolls since 1995The Daedric realm of Akavir, commonly known as Akavir, or "land of dragons," is a massive continent that stretches all the way from the equator to the poles in the middle of Tamriel. It is located in southern Tamriel, on the eastern side of the Inner Sea. The continent was created from the eruption of Red Mountain around 2E 582.[1] Before the first era, the land was inhabited by two races, the Bosmer of Elinhir, which was ruled by the Arch-Mage Meridia, and the Altmer of Akavir, currently ruled by the immortal Daedric Prince Nocturnal.Akavir is largely composed of volcanic islands,[2] the largest islands in Tamriel being Akavir (the largest, at roughly 1,300 islands), Stros M'Kai, and Sheogorad. The islands, and its numerous islands and small islands, are bordered on the north, west, and south by the largest continent in Tamriel, Auridon. The vast, barren continent is dominated by dense forests,[3] as well as extensive plateaus, plains, and small volcanic islands, and is extremely volcanically active and extremely prone to earthquakes, with many volcanoes forming on its eastern, southern, and northern shores.[2] On top of these islands, is the largest continent on Nirn.[4]Dwemer Continent [ edit ]Dwarves were once the greatest civilization on Akavir; they were the first to discover the continent. It is now a barren, rocky land dominated by volcanos.[5][6]The continent of Yokuda, also called Akavir, comprises large mountain ranges, which were once the home to powerful monsters. They are now desolate wastelands filled with no less than seven Great Races:[7]AbolethCelestial dragonDagonKoboldsNordsSpidersSkeletonThe continent of Cyrodiil is an island continent in the middle of the Inner Sea, between Tamriel and Akavir. It is ruled by the empire of the Altmer, which is split between the mortal realm and the realm of the Aedra, elves native to Akavir.[8]The continent of Valenwood is a long-abandoned continent that lies in the middle of the Tamriel/Akavir gulf. Although it is part of Nirn, it is still considered "the land of nightmares," and was where the Night Mother, Akatosh's consort, went down to die one last time before giving birth to the Daedra. Only one Dragonborn has ever passed through her gates.[9][10]Akavir, the land of dragonsIn the First Era the Akaviri Empire was the greatest empire on Tamriel, and was led by the legendary Emperor Mehrunes Dagon.[11] A few of the great rulers in the period, including Almalexia (d. 1E 242, at least as far back as the Argonian Invasion on Morrowind) and the first Emperor Camaron, ruled over Akavir before the rise of Tiber Septim as High King of Skyrim. When Almalexia met Camaron about the construction of the Imperial City of Akavir she remarked to him that the city would be a "dwarf-freezing, dragon-infested nightmare", and Camaron responded that it would be a city of "monsters and death".[12] For some three hundred years Akavir was under the shadow of a terrible threat from the Numidium, a gigantic mechanical artifact, which was the master machine of Mehrunes Dagon and the creator of all living creatures. The Empire built a massive ship, called the Divine Septim, to bring the Numidium to the Imperial City. In the battle of Bruma, the Divine Septim was destroyed and in its place a colossal statue made from Numidium steel was erected, in a temple of Daedric worship, in front of the Imperial Citadel. This statue was the symbol of Akavir for all time afterward.[13]Akavir's volcanic islands are home to a number of sentient, and not-so sentient, animals:The mer is a rare and beautiful race of bird-men that can survive on the oceans of Akavir, most often in pairs.[14]The mer are the original inhabitants of Tamriel and as such, they are the first inhabitants of Akavir. They are an aquatic race that can live on the deep sea and are considered the most ancient inhabitants of Akavir. However, mer can be found elsewhere in Tamriel, especially in Morrowind and Summerset Isle.[15][16] Akaviri mer have blue-green skin
By Michael R. CohenPresident Trump will be sworn in by Supreme Court Justice Anthony M. Kennedy next Jan. 20, and many in Congress are determined to prevent that.As the Senate Foreign Relations Committee takes its first steps toward crafting a Russia sanctions bill in the wake of the election's cyber-intrusions, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) said Congress would try to "avoid the mistakes of past policy by avoiding legislation that is bound to fail." He also has urged the Intelligence Community to "step up its sharing with Congress" on the alleged Russians' activities.But the prospects for success under the current dynamic are nil. Congress should be using the coming six months — and beyond — to craft comprehensive legislation that not only codifies the Obama administration policy, but also addresses Trump's repeated provocations with his own moves to weaken the sanctions.ADVERTISEMENTIf Congress fails to produce a sanctions bill, Trump and his administration stand ready to waive them — as has happened four times since the summer. If Congress does pass sanctions legislation, that legislation should, among other things, establish clear standards for the president to follow before lifting sanctions, with a strong presumption for enforcement. Failure to do so can be viewed as collusion.To date, senators from both parties say they are close to agreeing on a resolution with enough strong provisions to give Trump serious incentive to sign.The main hurdles remain the same as before. The House is expected to pass its own sanctions bill by the time of the Senate vote, putting its fate in the hands of its chairman and ranking member, who have expressed reluctance to pursue additional sanctions.The House bill includes much-needed limits on Trump's authority to lift sanctions unilaterally, though not all House Republicans support it. To avoid the appearance of retaliation, it also imposes penalties for countries that use the Internet for illicit purposes in violation of their sanctions. The Senate bill retains this and other important provisions, but has less teeth when it comes to punishing foreign nations if they fail to comply with its demands.Trump's actions and his administration's refusal to provide evidence of Russia's culpability have increased the urgency for Congress to act, and we believe that the House's bill offers a robust legislative response.The House bill is not perfect, but both the Senate's measure and the House bill need to be revised to address the realities that have arisen since the Kremlin interfered in our elections.The White House's decision to remove sanctions against the Russian intelligence and defense sectors only last week indicates that Congress will probably need help to reach consensus. The Senate should attach a measure allowing the Senate to vote on amendments to the bill, thus providing a more robust debate and more opportunities for amendments. The Senate should also allow for votes on separate versions of the bill, including the bill's proposed additional penalties on Russia for its interference, and amendments for those. It should also allow for some flexibility as to the number of Russian companies targeted for new sanctions.Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker Robert (Bob) Phillips CorkerBredesen says he won't back Schumer for Senate Dem leader GOP confidence grows on Kavanaugh Senate eyes Kavanaugh floor vote next week MORE (R., Tenn.), has been seeking more time from his colleagues than is permissible under Senate rules, for example, by pushing ahead on two separate proposals that would address Trump's conflicts of interest on his business empire. While Corker has been willing to give his colleagues more time as he seeks a path to a bill, this should not be interpreted as indicating that he will not try to find a way to pass a legislation on Russia sanctions.The House resolution would also make clear that the sanctions would expire if Trump failed to issue a new order ending all cyber-intrusions against the United States or if he removed any new restrictions on Russian companies like Rosneft that are not already subject to existing sanctions. We believe these requirements are more than sufficient to reassure the world that Trump will not be able to use the bill as a bargaining chip for his agenda that he has already promised to enact once he is in the White House. The House Foreign Affairs Committee resolution requires the White House to submit a report by December 31 detailing how it is implementing Trump's new executive order on cybersecurity and also what action the White House and National Security Council are taking to combat cybersecurity threats against the United States.The Senate resolution includes significant language that seeks to penalize Russia for its aggression, which Congress can use to further deter further meddling in our elections and in other nations. To this end, the resolution should impose penalties for individuals and other foreign entities that participate in cyber-activity that the United States believes is in violation of international law.If Congress takes its time to negotiate a sanctions bill and also produces an amendment that imposes tough penalties on Russia for its actions, Russia can expect an aggressive public relations campaign with a clear goal: to show both the United States and the world that Congress is impeding Trump's efforts to bring back the United States as a dominant force
In an interview with a small group of investors at the Barclays Technology Conference last evening, Tesla CEO Elon Musk addressed the recent Model S incident that was the result of the accelerator in the car acting on its own. As the company described it, "the brake was never applied to activate Autopilot."According to the report, "Mr. Musk said Tesla's engineers were surprised by the severity of the situation, because a normal driver using the brake could have been seriously hurt or killed."This is an example of "self-driving cars" that are far superior to human-driven vehicles. Tesla's autopilot allows for the driver to take over control of the vehicle at any time while keeping it in lane or following the GPS system.Musk emphasized, "These are dangerous cars — they're not very safe but they can be very safe."Musk said that the autopilot was "the right thing to do," and he explained more about the system's features on the Model S' dashboard display.From an interview with Yahoo Finance earlier this month, Musk explained a bit more about autopilot and its advantages over humans, saying, "If you put the autopilot on, as long as you maintain your speed you'll be fine, but you need to get all lanes of traffic to be clear of each other and this is really hard for cars to do."He goes on to say that the autopilot does not yet have a "defensive driving function."Last night, we talked over what Autopilot can do today, how it can improve, and whether a car with that technology might get us all home, without a care in the world.
A New Zealand couple, whose two children have lived in the country for 13 years, have been found guilty of importing drugs after authorities uncovered a large quantity of cannabis in their luggage, the Australian newspaper has reported.An Australian Border Force official reportedly found a bag containing a "significant" amount of cannabis on a flight departing from Sydney airport a week-and-a-half ago, according to the Sydney Morning Herald.The official, who has not been publicly identified, reported the seizure, saying: "There was cannabis in the hold of [the] bag. An amount that would be significant enough to make it into a drug-free zone.""At this stage, the couple do not face any charges and I can't comment on the details due to the court proceedings," an Australian Transport Safety Bureau spokeswoman told AP.The newspaper reports that the two men have pleaded not guilty to the charge, which carries potential penalties of life imprisonment.The couple, who have no prior convictions, arrived in Australia in 2003.An Australian Supreme Court justice, who is now retiring, told the newspaper the couple could be deported."All it takes is one piece of evidence of some sort and they'll be out," he said."It'd be outrageous if we turned them away on a reasonable apprehension without any evidence."The trial began before the court of justices of New South Wales on Tuesday, although the trial could have been delayed to take place before a full bench of nine justices.In Australia, the maximum penalty for drug offenders is up to 20 years in prison. However, with an estimated $200 billion in illicit drug profits annually, the punishment of life in prison for the possession of drugs is unlikely.
The European economy faces challenges in the decades ahead due to demographic trends including the increasing number of old people, low fertility rates, and growing reliance on social assistance and welfare. European leaders have been trying to meet these challenges through various policies including tax and unemployment relief for low-skilled workers. However, these policies need a long-term plan to deal with the challenges, which is why many European countries are looking at the possibility of an EU-wide basic income guarantee. The Basic Income Earth Network (BIEN) seeks to increase awareness of this potential solution. The Basic Income Earth Network is comprised of a diverse array of groups and individuals from across the political spectrum. Our members have a wide range of interest including the defense and promotion of the basic income guarantee, the advancement of free market principles, and the advocacy of policies to protect the earth. They include academics, journalists, economists, journalists, policy analysts, activists, and the general public. The Basic Income Earth Network is committed to advancing the cause of the basic income guarantee. Our advocacy includes publishing research, organizing conferences, developing practical and effective strategies, and holding a conference series. Our work is guided by the Basic Income Earth Network Principles, which include that:We advocate basic income for everyone regardless of their personal circumstances We understand that any system of basic income must address the challenges of automation, aging, and other issues that will have significant social, economic, and environmental effects We advocate the promotion of free markets as a means for improving human capabilities We have no interest in creating systems of mass unemployment in order to fund or assist in maintaining the basic income guarantee (BIG) We seek systems that provide an income sufficient to meet the basic needs of everyone with the least amount of hardship Possible solutions that might help create a system of Basic Income Earth Network are:Eliminating unemployment benefits for those less able to work Eliminating a wealth tax and a corporate income tax in order to replace them with a wealth transfer tax. This includes replacing government-mandated and government-enforced pensions with Basic Income Earth Network-provided individualized retirement accounts (Individual Retirement Accounts, or IRAs) which can be administered by a third party like a financial institution Eliminating tuition for graduate students (or any college education) for those students paying the full cost of tuition (similar to a tuition tax) Eliminating government programs that assist people not earning enough to pay for basic income and instead supplementing the income with other tax credits or grants for lower-income people who meet other eligibility criteria. This might include a public voucher system allowing people to purchase the same amount of income in basic income that they would pay for a private voucher. This would be a version of the successful Alaska Permanent Fund. Eliminating government child support programs (especially for single mothers) Eliminating child support for all children and adopting a zero-child-support policy for all single parents. The basic income guarantee would be funded in part by eliminating taxes that currently fall on women who give birth to children through government-sponsored family planning and abortion programs. This includes the earned income tax credit, the Child Tax Credit, and public spending on abortion programs and other programs that support children.Who is BIEN?The Basic Income Earth Network is a global, grassroots network of organizations committed to promoting a system of basic income guaranteed to all adults regardless of their employment status. We are concerned with protecting the earth by reducing poverty, promoting the free market, and advocating for free expression and free markets at large. However, we reject the view that social welfare programs provide a substitute for a society that places a higher value on privacy, human freedom, and individuality, and the idea that these programs are not affordable for those who need them.Our Principles
LONDON — A leading British Muslim scholar who has been jailed on a terrorism charge called his family members on Friday to tell them that he was innocent of the charge, according to a report.Ahmad Musa Jibril's father, Suleman, called him after he was arrested to tell him that he was innocent, according to a spokesman for the London's Metropolitan Police Department.Jibril, 34, who is of Bosnian heritage, was arrested on July 13, 2010, in the east London neighborhood of Merton after being flagged, police said in a statement. He was later charged with membership of an outlawed Pakistani extremist group and the preparation of terrorist acts.According to the BBC, Jibril's lawyers say that he attended meetings in Pakistan that were organized and funded by the government of Pakistan's former President, Benazir Bhutto. He was not part of the activities of the group, said his defense lawyer, Abdul Bary.Prosecutors say he met one of the members, Bilal Ahmed, whose father is the former leader of Hamas, the militant Palestinian group that rules the Gaza Strip.Jibril and Ahmed are both suspected of being members of an extremist group, al-Qaida-related group Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, or the Inspire Fund. Jibril's family said that Jibril never met Ahmed.Jibril was indicted in court in 2007 by the Northern Irish police agency and was denied bail. The charges were withdrawn against him in 2010. It is not known if he went through the appeals process and was freed on bail, which is generally granted to anyone awaiting trial.At the time of his arrest, Jibril was a doctoral student of Islamic Studies at the University at Buffalo, in New York, according to the Muslim American Society of New York. He is on medical leave from the university, said ISYN.Jibril was arrested by the Met Police in July 2010 after investigators said they have evidence that Pakistan-born Jibril and two other men met in Pakistan with Bilal Ahmed, who has been charged with membership of a Lashkar-e-Jhangvi and the preparation of terrorist acts.Bilal Ahmed, a leader in the terrorist organization Ansar al-Islam has a history of violent anti-Semitic attacks in Bangladesh. On Sept. 12, 2010, he stabbed to death an 81-year-old Jewish man and his son, both of whom were Jewish citizens of Bangladesh who lived in Brooklyn, N.Y. Ahmed reportedly declared that his victims were all "enemies of Allah" and that they deserved to die.
Roughly one in four Americans are taking medicine before the time they are supposed to, according to government statistics that suggest many people aren't getting the care they need.According to The Journal of the American Medical Association, more than 20 million Americans use medications to control pain, depression and other ailments that have to be taken daily or weekly.The Journal reports that people with chronic illnesses are twice as likely to take one or more prescription medications on a given day than people without them, and two-thirds of those taking medication say they think it makes them feel better."Most people don't ask for their medication," study author Dr. Robert E. Krahé of the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences told NPR. "They assume that because they're taking it, it must be helping them."The data also found that nearly half of Americans aren't using a medicine for their arthritis if they can do without.
Roughly a month after I started writing up my notes for the first episode of My Little Pony Season 3, I felt like there was nothing to add except a few additional pictures and a link to the full text of the first episode. Today, however, I want to discuss the series itself, one that I absolutely adore, though perhaps with a less fervent fan base than most.There's so much going on in My Little Pony Season 3, and it feels as if everything I've been writing is only a fraction of what is actually in the episodes. One of my main complaints in My Little Pony Season 2 was that the show was trying to be as inclusive as possible. This was obviously admirable in some ways, but it led to a much more insular experience where fans were much more afraid of a fandom that they couldn't understand than one with a larger audience. What I thought of when I watched My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic is that the show was trying to say the things that all kids were having in their lives, regardless of background, at the same time that the show was catering to those that already felt like they were an integral part of the show.This is a lesson that we're taking great steps toward in My Little Pony Season 3, and if you've watched every episode, this list of facts will probably seem like a disjointed ramble if you haven't seen every episode yet (which is a damn shame, because when you do, I promise you will agree). I'm going to try to focus on the things we did right in each episode, even if they're often outside of my control to do anything with. And when I tell you that the show is going to be more inclusive, let me also remind you that each of those "inclusive" qualities are still in some ways problematic to a greater extent.That being said, we've taken some great leaps forward.The Mane Six's Role in the ShowI'm going to start by going into how the Mane Six fit into the show, because it's a much more complex issue than just "The character was female!" or "The character is different!" The most controversial topic, and the one that will cause the biggest stir, is that of male characters being involved and the lack of representation of the female characters in the show.I've heard a lot of opinions on this from people who seem to have an extremely small knowledge of the show. So here's a little summary of what I've seen and heard – the show has a more diverse cast of role models than it has in the past, and there is a lot of potential for characters in the future. In general? Yes. The show is still lacking in the representation of female characters, but there are a lot of promising signs on this front as well.There have been five female characters to appear in every episode. This was a welcome sight, especially coming from a show with a history of terrible female representation.It would be easy to point to Pinkie Pie or Twilight Sparkle and call them examples of "strong female characters," but while they were certainly strong characters in the past, with a good deal of characterisation, I just don't think that these two represent the full spectrum of depictions of women on the show right now. Pinkie and Twilight are defined by traits we can identify as stereotypical for "feminine" personalities, as well as some that are not stereotypical.Twilight Sparkle, however, is more than capable of being a strong female character. She's funny, has a great sense of humor, and is a powerful pony. And if you're wondering why I'm not including Rainbow Dash… that's because Rainbow Dash has recently started going on a power trip with her new powers that is not exactly representative of a strong female character in my opinion.Now when I write about the depiction of "strong female characters," I'm referring to representation that was inspired by the gender/sexual identity that is already represented in the work being made. In this case, it's a woman who is defined by her attributes and attributes that she already has.And this makes sense because the show had so much potential to be inclusive if it actually tried – we've only really started building up Rainbow Dash's character in just the past few years.There's still room for improvement, but I feel comfortable saying that we're on the way to becoming a more inclusive show for females. Not by leaps and bounds, but as progress.The Show's Language Continues To Improve"It's time to play the Equestria Girls!""It's the day of your destiny.""Don't worry! Everything's going to be OK…"We hear these kind of comments as frequently as the show is going on. These are just a sampling of the language that we've found, but you might also notice that some of those comments are accompanied by the kind of language I've seen
A group of researchers from the University of Michigan has put the brakes on an investigation of the impact of cannabis use. The study by Dr. Matthew B. Miller and co-workers, published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal , was to investigate possible links between marijuana use and long-term brain function in healthy adults and those with brain trauma. The investigators asked participants to complete a battery of cognitive tests that would have required a drug test under the federal Controlled Substances Act. Although the findings were not statistically significant, the researchers said the results do not support calls for such a test. And Dr. Miller says he isn't advocating an outright ban on marijuana yet.But Dr. Miller's conclusion is more definitive and more damning. He wrote in his preprint that even in people who have not smoked marijuana but still smoke tobacco on a daily basis, "the magnitude of the effects of cannabis can only be considered moderate when compared to other psychotropic drugs. We do not know if [cannabis] has greater neurotoxic consequences at low and moderate doses. But there is no good evidence for the use of cannabis in the clinic as a treatment for neurodegenerative diseases. Its effects, measured from a therapeutic or preventive perspective, are likely not considerable or clinically relevant."Dr. Miller's report of the study is not the only report on the issue. In August 2013, the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) and the Office of the National Institute of Drug Abuse (ONEIDA) published a statement saying that "The evidence does not support marijuana as an effective treatment for chronic non-cancer pain, nausea, or vomiting due to chemotherapy, HIV/AIDS, or hepatitis C, or for other symptoms of pain in which the drug is typically prescribed." More recent reports of the ONDCP/ONEIDA statement have echoed those statements.Although there are many reasons why marijuana use might be less harmful than tobacco or caffeine, it is still a potentially dangerous drug. Marijuana addiction can lead to dependence and a history of abuse can create a user's sense of "high." And marijuana use has been associated with the development of schizophrenia-related psychosis in adolescents and young adults. Even one joint smoked a day can lead to the release of an agonist, a neurotransmitter, or a cannabinoid, which means that for most of the user's lifetime, inhaling marijuana may put the user at increased risk for neurodegenerative disease.But while we may not want everyone to use marijuana, we do need to study it critically and with an open mind. While many of the studies that have linked marijuana to neurodegeneration (even in marijuana users) are small in size (fewer than 10 subjects), the long course of marijuana use can change the structure and function of the brain. And while marijuana may not be the "gateway" into developing schizophrenia, we shouldn't ignore the fact that the brains of people who use frequently have shown alterations that suggest the drug may promote psychosis.In an editorial accompanying Dr. Miller's study, Michael R. Bloomfield, a professor of neurology at Vanderbilt University, writes that while it is reasonable to conclude that people using cannabis may benefit their well-being based on their experiences with it, "Dr. Miller is absolutely correct that research is lacking to say unequivocally how many negative symptoms or brain changes are associated with marijuana use. More studies need to be conducted to find out."The American Association of Addiction Medicine has issued guidelines for doctors about the potential effects of cannabis use. In the guidelines , AAM and the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse recommend that marijuana use is only "approved treatment" in medical marijuana states and that its use is "treating only a subset of the conditions for which it is prescribed."The guidelines also argue that cannabis should not be used as an alternative to addictive substances or as an aid in recovery from addiction. It is also critical to keep in mind that the AAM position is based on science, not public opinion. But when it comes to marijuana, this is still not the position of the overwhelming majority of the scientific community.And Dr. Daniel Kripke, the chief cognitive neuroscientist at the University of California, Irvine, has made it clear that marijuana will continue to be studied for its implications as a drug. He points out that the "evidence is quite strong that there are differences of some sort in cognitive performance that accompany the use of marijuana." And he warns that a lack of rigorous research about marijuana is a potential "firestorm" in the marijuana research community because people are already worried about what their next move might be.A more balanced view could be to give marijuana study participants the opportunity to abstain. And there does have to be a scientific basis for such a withdrawal, not just on the basis of "it feels better in the morning."As is the case in many areas, the science is complicated, and the politics is a mixed bag. The federal government still doesn't think marijuana's risks are great
For a while, it was thought that the recent decline in the US dollar could lead to a sharp increase in Bitcoin activity outside of the US. After all, there aren't as many ways you can spend or barter in dollars — and because US dollar transactions happen far more often than they used to, Bitcoin transactions could become just as lucrative as people think. Just this July, for instance, bitcoiners exchanged $2.6m, or about the same amount as in January. Since then, though, they've been down sharply, falling to about $800 a coin in the past couple of weeks.But according to new data from CoinDesk, the currency's recent slide is starting to feel like a temporary blip — or maybe more like a long pause in the tide — rather than a serious problem.As part of a report looking at the digital coins' recent performance, CoinDesk examined the exchange rate between the US dollar and a handful of other digital currencies: Ethereum, BitUSD, Ripple, and Bitcoin Gold. A few of these currencies are also very popular in China and other markets that have seen capital move there rapidly due to recent economic and political shifts.CoinDeskThe results don't reflect any actual shift in where Bitcoin is being traded, but it does hint at just how big its market share has shrunk in recent months. Bitcoin Gold, for instance, is up 5,000% in one month, but only up 6,000% in the past few months. Ethereum itself also hasn't seen real growth over the past few months, and while Ripple's price is up over 200% in the past two years, that's down by nearly two-thirds in the same period.That seems like an important sign that Bitcoin, as the largest digital currency by market value, is not really the only game in town. Even the most important rival, Ethereum, appears to have its share of digital coins to play with, even if its biggest rival, Bitcoin, doesn't really want to.
Image caption Asma Marlou was found guilty of two rapesA woman who said she was attacked in a Stockholm street is to be deported.The court heard Asma Marlou, 29, was dragged off a bus by two men and had her hijab ripped off, but did not report it.Prosecutor Eric Larsson said Marlou would be put on a plane back to her home country.Marlou, who was sentenced to two years in prison, claimed she had been sexually assaulted and had refused to cooperate with police at the time.She denied she was drunk and had no previous convictions for drugs or violence.As Marlou testified in court earlier, she became visibly distressed and was overheard crying and asking, "Am I a good girl? Am I a bad girl?"The prosecutor also said Marlou denied she had raped two men, but she was ordered to take the stand and testify in her defence.Image caption Swedish police officers investigating the caseAfter the attack, Marlou told reporters she was groped and attacked with a hammer but had to leave the bus after a couple approached and asked whether she had brought a man back to their hotel room.Marlou said she had been in a sexual relationship with the man and then the two men dragged her out of the station and into the street, where they forced her to perform oral sex on them.The court heard police officers in Gothenburg investigated the attack but never took any action.In 2012, another woman was also removed from a train by a man after he pulled up next to her and asked if he could sit next to her but she refused.
A federal prosecution into the killing of an undocumented immigrant in Washington state is about to get underway.U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced in late October that John Henry Hernandez, 37, of Tacoma, had been indicted on a second-degree murder charge.Hernandez was arrested in April 2016 by members of the FBI-led joint task force, charged with fatally shooting Jose Jesus Molina.Molina, 32, had walked into a Taco Bell restaurant with his 2-year-old daughter, had been drinking, and then disappeared under suspicious circumstances as family and friends searched for him. A few days later, Molina was found and pronounced dead at Hennepin County Medical Center, according to an FBI affidavit.John Henry Hernandez, 37, left. He was charged in the killing of an undocumented immigrant in Washington state, according to a federal indictment. He has pleaded not guilty. He has pleaded not guilty. (The Daily Times photo)The indictment said Molina's body was "cold to the touch."Molina had been living legally in the country since he was 15, according to news reports. According to his Facebook page, he was a registered nurse with a license to practice in Washington state. It does not appear Molina had a criminal record.The Washington State Patrol had been searching for Hernandez since his arrest in April and he was expected in court this week. He has pleaded not guilty. His attorney, J.T. McBride, did not immediately return an email seeking comment.The two people charged with Molina's murder — Alfred Hernandez, 42, and Eduardo Hernandez, 44, both from Tacoma — have been charged separately in federal court and their cases are pending.The new indictment came days before a sentencing hearing for Alfred Hernandez. The indictment alleges Hernadez ordered Alfred to "do or perform anything as directed by John Henry Hernandez on or about January 16, 2016."Eduardo Hernandez, a father of three, told investigators that he was ordered by Hernadez to do or perform anything as directed by Hernadez on or about February 11, 2016, the indictment alleges.It added that Hernadez had asked Alfred to "take someone on a 'fun ride' at the time" and that Alfred had made the request to Eduardo Hernandez "to avoid further trouble."John Henry Hernandez faces a second-degree murder charge in the slaying of an undocumented immigrant in Washington State. (King County Sheriff's Department)John Henry Hernandez, who is being represented by McBride, faces up to 30 years in prison if convicted of the second-degree murder count when he is sentenced for the April 2016 shooting, the indictment alleges.Hernandez is also charged with unlawful possession of a firearm and unlawful possession of ammunition by a felon, the charges said. Both charges carry a maximum penalty of five years in prison. Prosecutors have said Hernandez's firearms and ammunition were seized during a 2013 search, but it was unclear whether the gun he allegedly used in the shooting had been seized that day, or if it was surrendered.The federal indictment says Hernadez "had an understanding as to his actions" that was "not merely reckless, but deliberately indifferent" toward the life of an undocumented immigrant.The case is being prosecuted by the U.S. Attorney's Office in Tacoma.
(CNN) Two more people died Wednesday when a magnitude-7.0 earthquake hit southeast of Kumamoto prefecture, the Japanese government reported.No details on injuries have been made available by the government.The USGS identified the quakes as an aftershock. It was a "moderate aftershock" that occurred 11 seconds after the magnitude-6.3 quake, but there was no tsunami advisory issued for Japan.It struck at a depth of 9 kilometers, according to the USGS.A tsunami warning was issued early Wednesday evening, but officials say there is no immediate danger to the area.
This article is about the episode. You may be looking for the character."The Day the Earth Stood Cool" is the eighteenth episode of the fifth season of Adventure Time. It is the one hundred eighty-seventh episode overall.Contents show]SynopsisThe Tree People are running out of food, so Finn and Jake try to get them to eat other things.PlotThe Tree People are at the top of the Tree Fort in a treehouse watching a caveman on a hill climb an artificial hill. Finn and Jake arrive and ask the Tree People to go to another building in the back, though they are reluctant and seem uninterested. Finn tries to tell them to look behind him, but is stopped by Jake. Instead, Finn goes over the cliff as the Tree People watch him go. They are surprised by this, for he seems extremely powerful. Finally, the Tree People start to climb after him but stop after realizing he is going the wrong way, and go back to the building. On their way there, a giant Tree Hugger stops them. A Tree Hugger tells Jake that they are hungry and gives him some fruits, which he then eats before the Tree Huggers notice him.Jake is surprised that they can't see that he ate them, but Finn replies that they are able to see very little without their ability to see. They then start to eat the fruit and become much more energetic. The same Tree Monster that was there earlier now appears and tries to eat Jake, but is scared off by the Finn and Jake.Jake is hungry and wants to eat the Tree Huggers, but the Giant Tree Hugger again runs away. Jake then takes a bite and discovers that it was not apples, but rather, bananas.At some point, the Tree People are in a forest where they are eating a large number of bananas. The Banana Guard is in charge, but Jake is now the Banana King and asks for his banana now. When he asks the Banana Guard, to get the Banana King his banana, the Banana Guard tells him that he didn't pay for the bananas in the forest. Jake tells the Banana Guard that he ate them. Soon, Jake is given the banana by the Banana Guard. He then gives it to the Banana Guard, who is shocked by its sweetness, but begins to dig into the banana. Jake then calls Finn and tells him that he found a piece of what looked like the moon, and asks for it to be thrown down as a ring, which Finn agrees to. He then says to Jake that he was the one who bought the bananas. Jake is delighted, and happily tosses the moon down, much to Finn's dismay. Finn then tells Finn that the bananas are now safe and not going to get eaten. Soon, Finn gets back onto the trail the Tree People took, and they're soon at the bottom of the hole. Jake takes a bite out of the Tree Monster. The Tree Monster screams, and Jake tries to fight the Tree Monster back by grabbing his feet, only to be bitten by it instead.After their encounter with the Tree Monster, the Tree People are no longer hungry, but they are still confused as to why they left their treehouse to come here. Jake tells them that he was about to turn into a tree and that the Finn and Jake were there because he told them to. Jake turns into a tree and reveals that it's because he ate the Banana Guard's banana. However, it turns out to not be a banana as it is actually a stone statue that Finn and Jake are using as a door. The Tree People also turn back into a tree, but soon turn back into monkeys after Finn removes the stone by pushing it. Jake starts to go down to explore the stone, but a snake comes up behind him and snatches his backpack, which Jake has just been using to explore the hole. He then runs into Finn. Meanwhile, the Stone Monster tells Jake that it doesn't eat children and makes it clear that it knows about the banana. Jake tries to fight the Stone Monster again, only to be bitten by it again.Finn starts to explain that it was the Banana Guards' banana, and, at first, this may sound like the story Jake just told the Tree People, but the Stone Monster interrupts Finn's story to tell Jake that the Banana Guards didn't have bananas. Jake says that he never ate any bananas after he tried to eat the Banana Guard's banana. The Stone Monster agrees, but then Finn, noticing the Stone Monster's reaction, tries to get it to give up on Jake. Jake then grabs Finn and tells him that it'll never eat Jake because he's not a boy anymore, much to Finn's surprise; Jake says he won't let it go and punches the Stone Monster, throwing it into the hole. The Monkey Guard turns his attention to Finn and is about to bite him when the Banana Guard appears and scares it off. They then look around for the

In the wake of Donald Trump's election, many people have taken to wondering "what is it about Trump?" and "which traits of Trump have shaped our politics since his election?"That's a question of value judgments. It's a question I have asked myself, at times. It's a question I've asked others, too.My response, in its simplest form: People who do not have to worry about the future as much as some people have to worry about it tend to act more recklessly — in that way, they tend to be selfish and more like psychopaths.But I was wrong. There's a whole literature on this, many of which are quite good. There's a literature about the Republican party's "cult of personality" — and whether there's a cult of personality in the Democratic party.There's a literature about Trump's supporters' psychological profile, and whether there's a cult of personality in the opposition on the left.There's a literature on whether Trump's victory reflects more on America's "cultural decay," or on America's declining economic condition.There's so much literature on these issues that it's not really possible to get too lost in a debate for what we should be measuring, or for what it means that one party is a "cabal" and the other a "coalition."In the end, we're left to make our own judgments. And here I must confess that as a person of conservative thought, I'm rather confused.In a sense, it's not clear to me that there was anything that changed from the pre-election polls that made the difference that made Trump possible. He did not have what I would call a "gimme" voter, an idealistic person who wanted to see a world in which everyone is treated fairly. He did not have what I would call an "obedience" voter, someone who was willing to do anything, including breaking some laws, to get what he or she wants, whether it's illegal immigration, or trade deals, or whatever. I would call them "stealers" rather than "cooperators."
The best part about the new season of RuPaul's Drag Race is that after weeks of intense competition, new queens are revealed with their first episodes. As soon as season 7 premieres this Friday, I can already tell you that there's going to be some changes to this season. Like, a whole lot of changes.In the last couple days, I've spoken to a number of girls who are all working their way up to the top of the game, and all had very specific expectations before getting on the show. This first batch of episodes are all new to some of the returning girls. And the whole time that I've been reading and chatting with them this week, there really hasn't been a sense of fear, worry, or insecurity about what's going to happen to them because they've all come back to Drag Race ready to take it to the next level.So I thought "What if they all had the opportunity to do it all over again?" And that's what we're going to do for this first batch of drag interviews, where we're talking to each of the 14 queens about what they want to change about Drag Race next time around.Here it is: 14 RuPaul's Drag Race Season 7 Drag Queen Interviews.What were your expectations before coming back to RuPaul's Drag Race Season 7? And what did they change?I was going into this season in the hopes I would get to be a final three contestant. I really wanted that. I wasn't thinking about being in the top four. My goal was to get the whole top four.I have been through a lot of experiences on this show. I have been with people that I thought would be good friends, but ended up not liking them, and people I thought were going to be on my season come out and go on to be people I don't like.Drag Race as a whole has been great because it's the first time in many years that I've gotten to really know my queens without watching them live a little bit because it takes too much time. My time to get to know the people and to get to know their personalities is short.I wanted to come back and have that experience, so I was ready for a lot of different things. I didn't see any of the mistakes that happened on my season last season on this season. There was no drama. Everyone was respectful to one another and we had a great time together doing what we wanted to do and that's drag.What were you most looking forward to about the queens this season? Were there any surprises?There was a lot of diversity this season as far as the looks that were given to the contestants. It was such a diverse group, which I never would have expected last season. And in being diverse, every season, especially when you run a large competition like this, it becomes a very self-selecting group. Some people aren't really in this for the art.Some people aren't really in the competition for the drag. They're here to give a performance and they can show them where they have flaws, strengths, whatever, and I think our season will be better as a result of that.There was this huge emphasis on the artistry within the whole season that never really seemed to exist that I remember in the past. It was more about trying to do something that you're not very good at or you don't have the skillset for.This time around as far as the queens go, it's really not about the looks but more about what kind of drag you can do that really stands out and makes people take notice of you.How did you do on this season of Drag Race? What was your best performance? And what would you go back and change for the new season?I think I did well because I do take pride in my work. I have done a lot of shows in New York, but I've done the most shows in New Jersey over the last five or six years.I love performing live. I enjoy performing drag. I'm always excited to be performing. You're so in the moment that you don't think about the fact that you're performing.That was my best performance. It was an homage to Nina Bo'nina Brown with her one-syllable phrase: 'You don't know me, but I'm in your face every day.'I've done shows where I do a lot of accents or have a specific accent. When I did the parody of Britney Spears, I kind of got to do a lot of accents because all of the other boys did really well, so I had to do a lot of accents just to stay close to Nina's lines.That was my best performance. I did a lot of shows at The Comedy Cellar at the Barclays Center before season 7 even took place. I had done a show or two before that at
This week is the 100th anniversary of the birth of one of the twentiethcentury's most influential philosophers: F.W. de Kuijer.The philosopher (also known as Paul Verhaeghen) was born in Germany in 1864. (He was the first of his family to attend university)In the late 1860s his father, John Verhaeghen, was among the first people to explore Hegel's philosophy, and his father's philosophy inspired F.W. de Kuijer to explore the idea of transcendent cognition (the process by which we 'know' something)His father believed that, once a person has completed their work (either as an artist, philosopher or citizen), they become their own author and creator of history (he went to the trouble of producing a biography of himself).F.W. de Kuijer's work is now in a translation series called "Vernunft: Philosophie der Universität" from which the following quotes are taken.What is the fundamental difference between a human being and a machine?A machine does what it is ordered to do by its overseer. Human beings are not ordered to act. They only act once given the information, or reason, to do so. But the problem is to discover the information which will, in the end, lead to the act, and so to take a course in the direction in which it is necessary. That is another question altogether.How does our cognitive life differ from that of a plant?Plants are dependent on external stimuli for their own life. They depend on sunlight, they need to be watered, they need to be treated with medicines. There are no external stimuli which do not have a negative relationship with them. And yet we perceive that they exist, we are able to see them and touch them. It is only by way of their relation to us that we can perceive them. They exist, they move, they react. We are their machines. We work them. We do everything which they require; we build factories for them to work in. But they live from their own inner strength, from the inner strength they already have within them, which is the cause of their existence and not something which we direct or give them.How, therefore, are we to understand the difference between the natural human existence and the mechanical existence? Human life is made up of a complex whole of actions (and their consequences). But we do not know (and do not want to know) what these actions are or are not. We need to understand the cause of and the nature of action. But how to find it? And how to go from what we know to what we do not know? We can describe the actions we have, which we have the capacity to perform, but not yet perform. And if a person has a mechanical body (skeleton) it makes no more sense to say 'I could have lifted my arm, but I did not' than for me to say 'I could have raised my hand', even if I can do it, because I 'cannot move'. In another sense, however, a mechanical body might be more or less capable to perform certain actions, since it has to be constructed after the fact.So is it possible that we could perform the action without the reason having the feeling that we need the action in order to perform it? F.W. de Kuijer rejects the proposition of this type of reasoning:There were, in the early days of Hegel's philosophy, those thinkers who insisted on a dualism between reason and feeling. These people did not have much sympathy with those who thought that the only thing worth having in life is the feeling that makes us act, and not the desire to be conscious of it.In a previous blog post I mentioned the idea of feeling as opposed to reason. F.W. de Kuijer thinks that there is a certain 'inclusiveness' to reason, and that it is not only the intellect 'understanding itself' but also the feelings (or "spirit", in German terms) which "understand that we are our own agents and that we have the capacity to make ourselves conscious of them" (page 20).The first time I encountered this idea, it was from a Russian-speaking philosopher called Evgeny S. Zhorov. He argued that the only authentic form of knowledge was a form in which the soul knows itself, and that, as part of this being is consciousness, so is everything else for which it is responsible: "If consciousness can make any man a philosopher, then philosophy is all right" (p. 14).But this conception of our 'being-for-self' (which would be the true form of human nature; not the way we are 'made-to-be' or programmed-to-understand), does not seem to satisfy us.As de
The following pages will be updated when it becomes available.IntroductionIn our previous tutorials on Python for Beginners, we learned two main programming concepts: objects and functions. We also learned some concepts behind objects and functions using an example program that calculates the cost of buying a stock. However, I found that some people might not be familiar with how objects relate to functions and how to properly use objects in your code. In this tutorial, we will look at how to create and use objects, and how to use them to accomplish different tasks. The purpose of this tutorial is to be thorough, but to also explain the main concepts in as few pages possible, allowing you to practice and review the concepts.We will first look at how a variable is created and what kinds of variables are supported and explained in the standard library with examples. We will end with what variables can return or contain, and how to manipulate variables in a correct way.Before You StartOur first step is to create our project, so head over to our tutorial page and download the blank version of our project. It has the Python module for the Arduino and two classes, a class to print something on the serial port, and another class to handle buttons.Now that you have the project downloaded, click on the "IDE" button so that you can write the code, using the editor that is created under the project name, "Python Projects for Beginners".The IDE that you will use is not quite the same as the one we started with for our Python tutorials, but it is good enough to see the basics, and it will help you a lot along the way. Here is a link to it: ArduMe Arduino IDEFor this tutorial, you will write the Arduino code using a very simple language called "Python", which we use to create our simple C# programs. This is the programming language that all Python programs are written in. To read more about Python and how to use it, take a look at our Python TutorialIf in doubt, it is always better to create a C# or .NET program rather than a Python program. C# and .NET are similar to Python, only faster and more powerful, while Python is more powerful and slower than C# and .NET. Python is a more powerful programming language than any other programming language, and it is a good choice for beginners with limited programming skills.Note: If this seems like an extremely complicated topic to learn, be sure to check out our Python Tutorial for more on that subject.We will start by learning all about variables and how to create a variable, and then we will move onto the main topic of this tutorial: creating and using an object.For more Python tutorials, check out our Python Tutorials Category .Getting Started With PythonIn the Arduino tutorial, I created a simple program that prints a message saying that we have pressed a button. For this tutorial, we will instead create one program that prints "Hello World!" with one button pressed. The first thing we need to know, is how to access the serial port in Python.To get started on Python programming, we need to know how to access the serial port in your computer (not Arduino), and we need to know how our Arduino interacts with the serial port. For the Arduino, the "UART" serial bus serial port is the main connection that all microcontrollers use.A UART port is an eight-wire serial port that sends, and receives data using one wire, rather than two.In most computers, the "UART" port is automatically created automatically when you first turn your computer on or reboot. If you turn it off, it will be automatically reconfigured.If you don't have a computer on your computer, or you are having trouble getting the UART port to appear in your OS, you can download "UART Viewer" to get a preview of the serial port with some default settings. It can be downloaded at:Once downloaded, open the downloaded file and follow the directions to "view" serial ports. You will see your UART interface with the number of UARTs and pins connected. Here can find all the pins and ports as well as descriptions.Next, we are going to open a Python console to look at all the "objects" and "functions" that are running on the Arduino. Right click on your project in the IDE and select open console. From there, we will see the following:We will start by adding code to the Arduino, so type in your code to the green text area in the upper left hand corner:First, click on the "Upload" button, because "Upload" means to tell the Arduino to "upload" our new code to the board. It is important that you click the "Upload" button, because you will have to wait until the code is successfully uploaded to
How do you make the best of a bad situation? And what do we do when we need to find ways to make our lives better without becoming our own worst enemy? As we get older, we can become more self-critical and pessimistic, believing the world is out to get us. But what if it wasn't? What if the world is good and it wants to help?This is the message explored in the new PBS documentary on Buddhism called Life After Death. The premise is simple: If dying is no catastrophe, what's on the other side of death, if it's no catastrophe, shouldn't be bad?A Buddhist doctor, for example, believes there is a way to make our lives better after death. He's so adamant on his beliefs that he will risk his life to prove his concepts.Buddhist and Hindu doctors, astrologers, and psychics have all made this assertion about the fate of the human soul, but it's not widely accepted in mainstream Buddhism. And it's just one case study, and certainly far from representative. But what if this one person is right and others aren't? Do we get to see whether the Buddhist concept lives up to its reputation, or does it end up as a cliché?This is one of the key stories that Life After Death tells. It is an investigation of the philosophy of Buddhism as a science of life.With the help of a Buddhist monk named Yutaka Mifune, the film explores whether there is any merit in Buddhism, if rebirth can make its mark on our lives. As the film notes, Buddhist ideas about the soul are actually more nuanced than some may realize: The idea of rebirth itself is a philosophy that's been developed over two millennia and can hold the answers to what happens after life ends. The Dalai Lama is quoted as saying the soul has a thousand lives, which is a metaphor from Hinduism about the eternal cycle of rebirth (although he might be referring to another mythological cycle). The film also shows that in Buddhist practice, we make peace with this idea, accepting that even after death there is still beauty and goodness beyond the wheel of birth and death.The film provides some interesting answers to why traditional Buddhists are very critical of death and rebirth, and shows some Buddhist practitioners have embraced these ideas as part of our practice. But the more we learn about the concept of reincarnation, and how the Buddhist tradition is often more compassionate towards dying humans, the more we're left asking: What does it mean to "be of good cheer?This is not going to be a typical documentary about Buddhism. But like most good things—this movie is a great reminder that the best things in life always come from the greatest struggles and tragedies we can bring to life. It also shows there are more benefits than downsides to becoming a good parent, a good worker, a good friend, a kind neighbour, a good parent, a good friend, and even a good doctor.

These pages focus mainly on the general aspects of running a Runeblade of Vyrthur campaign, but there are a few sections as well which cover in-depth information about various rules within the game such as battle conditions and rules for combat with the environment and the creatures of the world.Some of these references focus around running a scenario, while others focus on a single character and his or her adventures. Please note, that any information contained in these references is not necessarily applicable to playing out the rules and the game in a campaign setting - these are merely intended to give you an overview of the setting - as Runeblade of Vyrthur is not a rule-driven game, a campaign should not be considered to have been played out unless the campaign follows the rules within the guide.These guides are not a substitute for playing the game and should not be viewed as a "complete" guide for campaign games. This is simply intended to provide a general overview for the majority of campaigns and to provide the necessary background information to run the game in a manner that feels familiar.Contents show]Campaigns EditCharacters EditThe character types and rules for setting up a character within Runeblade of Vyrthur allow for a wide variety of options, ranging from the more typical and "generic" adventurer to the more unusual and "eccentric" characters.For a more detailed look at what each character type means, please see Character Types.Gameplay EditRules EditRules are the core of Runeblade of Vyrthur's gameplay. In order for things to be done in Runeblade, they must be done according to the rules. The ruleset is not "hard-line" or rigid - it is meant to be flexible and allowing for a wide range of possibilities. The game itself can be run in an immersive and exciting way even without the rules.This section will detail all the rules within the game. These rules are included in all guide chapters, however certain sections may refer to other parts in the game as well as being referenced in the various reference articles.Dungeon Master (DM) EditThe Dungeon Master is the person in charge of running the events that take place in a campaign. To help with his/her duties, the DM receives all campaign information via an app called "Campaign Manager" (see below).Campaign Manager EditCampaign Manager is an app built by a third party that allows players to enter the game's world and create unique "scenarios" and campaigns for their characters to experience. By registering with the app and using its functionality, the DM has access to detailed information about the world and each character's home-world as well as information about various NPCs and foes that are active in the campaign world.Campaign Manager also works in conjunction with the Dungeon Master's app to share scenarios with the player-characters.Campaign Manager will not share information with other DM's on the account for other people or players (like running the campaign), however it does make that information available to the DM - including the ability to see and mark the events that other PCs create.Campaign Manager also allows the DM to create and share scenarios using pre-made scenarios, however it would be prudent for the DM to carefully edit each scenario before putting it on the app. If the DM is going to do this, then a couple things would need to be said on the campaign page for the campaign so the players know how to find that page.For example, the page for a campaign should not contain:1. Any spoilers for the plot or any characters. The player is a part of the story, and it would not make sense for the campaign to share plot and character information in such a manner.2. Characters that are already part of an existing campaign. These characters should not be included on the campaign page. It simply doesn't make sense.3. Story elements from other games.4. If the DM is going to create a whole new campaign, there is no need to include the characters from other RPG classes/races.5. Information about the other world. If the DM wants to include information from a source such as the Forgotten Realms, this information should be added to the "World Information" section of the user page for the campaign.Campaign Manager can also be used with a tablet device (such as a smartphone or tablet) by sending the DM a link to one of the campaign pages on a device on which the DM is playing. The Android campaign creation process will work by default if a Google account is being used with this device.User Profile EditCampaign Manager can be used with a tablet device (such as a smartphone or tablet) by sending the DM
I am a very big fan of a little known Italian writer, Giorgio de Chirico, but this is my favourite of all his books that I have read. The Italian poet and essayist, who died in 1935, is often referred to as the 'father of the contemporary Italian novel'.The book is The Mirror of the Falling World, but De Chirico had a reputation for writing science fiction, fantasy and surreal poetry. The Mirror of the Falling World is described in the introduction with the words of its translator, the Italian writer Giorgio de Chirico:The book concerns "a whole series of worlds, the Mirror World, and three worlds of our own Earth." The first is populated by a few people who "exist on the ground of the Mirror and make use of this surface as a plane of observation." The third is inhabited by an "unconscious force, which has grown to an almost total power and is a real entity of its own, and is, at the same time, only a phenomenon." The 'force' does not take part in ordinary human affairs, nor in the workings of human society. There is "no real law; the world, it appears, does not have any law as such." The mirror is a "space which is constantly growing and shrinking; it becomes smaller as it is more and more beautiful and larger as it gets more and more ugly; the more beautiful the mirror, the less it is able to contain what appears to be the totality of its beauty." The universe is divided into three parts: the World, the World of the Mirror, and one World beyond the Mirror.De Chirico's 'Worlds' were imagined with different names by his readers:[in a description of a world of the world, the world of mirrors] is a world ruled by power and illusion, it consists of five worlds at the same time – the World of the Mirror, the World Beyond the Mirror, and two others unknown to me. There are many kingdoms, cities without inhabitants. I have spent some years in this world, and I have heard only of many things here and there...The first part of the book concerns a series of stories called The Fall of the Lettuce, which are essentially historical novels. The reader is given a map and the names of the people, places and things described, but these details are not part of the story. But when the first of these stories is discovered, the reader will notice in it that De Chirico creates what seems to be a parallel universe to his main one.I liked the first two stories in this collection. The narrator of The Fall of the Lettuce is a former prostitute who has just given birth to twins. She does not have an ideal life. Her husband is a man who "knows what he is doing," when he marries her: he seduces her and marries her "to the sound of a voice. To the sight of the sun. The moon rising over some fields of purple with a great white flame that makes it burn in the air like an orange in a tree." As time passes and he has time with the two children he discovers there are many more stories and stories about him before the end of all things. The father is a man who has a secret: he is "not a man of the same world" in which he lives.It took me some time to read these stories. They were beautifully written. I have read De Chirico in another collection and found that it was very difficult to remember the name of the character in The Fall of the Lettuce (in which case I had no problem remembering the name of a character in another collection). Also the names of the people who appeared in De Chirico's stories tended to be given in the middle of the story, which I found confusing because I had to repeat these names every time a new person or place was mentioned – for example "in that corner, in the house, that was where…"De Chirico's writing is always quite beautiful, a sort of surreal poetry in which the form and language are very abstract. The language as a whole is filled with metaphors for different kinds of objects and ideas, all of which seem like a mirror of something: the mirrors are of ideas and of mirrors. De Chirico was one of the first Italian writers to use the word 'discovery'. The reader will notice that the names of the people and of the places used in De Chirico's books are often vague, but that in some of them the reader learns more about the characters.For example in The Mirror of the Falling World the reader starts with the first of the five worlds that De Chirico describes, but soon sees that the author describes a much larger world, one in which there are no mirror things. This is partly because De Chirico used many different names for the different 'worlds': in one story the first world
HockeyFrozen Royalty Podcast - Episode 8We're down to the final 2! Our two picks to crown Hockey's Royalty King of the North are John Tavares and Johnny Gaudreau. Gaudreau looks like he can win this race and he is, in my opinion, a much tougher bet (which also gives Gaudreau a chance at the final vote). Tavares is another guy that can beat out Gaudreau.With all that said, I think Tavares can get to 50.1% of the fan vote to win the crown. Tavares won the fan ballot in 2013 but the vote he received in this year's tournament was a lot stronger. It's still Tavares' to lose. I'm going to go with 57% though, a decent chance to win the Cup with as many votes as possible.We also talk about how Tavares is being treated by the media. There is plenty of anger and frustration on both sides but they were always going to lose for this to continue. I think everyone is too quick to point the finger at each other. The media has been very, very critical of Tavares in the last few years and Gaudreau is not immune.Check the show notes (and let us know what you think on Twitter @frozenroyalty) and we'll see you next time!Subscribe to the Podcast:
The following blog post, unless otherwise noted, was written by a member of Gamasutra's community.The thoughts and opinions expressed are those of the writer and not Gamasutra or its parent company.I'm not a gamer by any stretch of the imagination, but the news of Microsoft's reversion to its old policy on game prices has me interested in picking up a copy of Deadbolt. At $20, it's cheap for the genre – one of the cheapest titles on PSN this month, at least!Deadbolt is simple and fun, and does a great job capturing the "arcade" spirit. The objective is simple: collect gold and use it to upgrade your super gun. Gold is earned by collecting coins, which can be found throughout the levels.A classic isometric side scrolling shooter.Every level has a set number of coins which must be collected before moving on. The number varies depending on type of enemy and stage. Each time you die, you take away a few coins (I didn't count them as "wasted" but it felt right). The game rewards you for playing well (or trying) by having you earn more coins in subsequent levels.After beating level 1-5 (or 5-20), your health returns to one (because, duh), which lets you begin Level 6. You start by getting the starting points and building up your super gun. As you collect the gold you can upgrade your ability. Each weapon allows you to get a bit more out of each hit and has an extra bonus effect if you use it in conjunction with another.Every enemy is a little bit different. I liked how enemies took damage depending on their location, attack pattern, and if they had a health bar. It was a nice touch, and it actually feels like I'm helping the enemy take a hit. They're not just bullet sponges. There's some nice variety and replay value.Your "tiles" feature a variety of types of tiles on them. Some tiles are passive, like the "wall" tiles that block bullets. Others are active, such as the "ball" tiles that are used when you hit an enemy to launch them around. The game is a bit on the simple side – there's not too much to learn, and the level design makes you think. If you die, you're out of luck, but you can come back. If you get hit a few times, you're out of the game.The levels are well designed and quite varied. Some are easy and won't take you long to beat (there are "Easy-Normal" and "Hard" difficulty levels). Some take longer than they ought, but are worth it. One level I found was a lot of fun, but I was able to beat it without using a map or tutorial.My only gripe is that my score was not calculated after each death – I found it really annoying. This made for some very annoying levels. With that said, I was able to beat the game without ever dying.One feature that I really liked was the ability to "unload" the super weapon at level 3 in order to buy "upgrades". These upgrades allow you to kill enemies in a different way, for example you can use a grenade to set an enemy on fire which will do extra damage. There's a few weapons, as well as a super gun for extra challenge – and a total of 5 levels. I really enjoyed playing through these 10 "minigames" – the music, the music, the music.Deadbolt is an old-school arcade game which looks and feels like what I hoped it would look and feel like. On top of that, it has some nice retro and "arcade" touches. If you love the genre, give this one a try!Disclaimer: This product was obtained from the publisher for review purposes.

A woman in New York City was hospitalized and a man was injured when a woman pulled a gun during an argument in a subway carriage near a stop, authorities said.The 26-year-old woman was sitting up in the carriage when a man and woman began arguing, according to CNN.The man pulled out a gun in order to protect his girlfriend, who suffered a gunshot wound in the neck, the network said — but the gun's magazine and ammunition were missing."They have a guy in the subway who shot himself in the neck," a witness told reporters. "It's really crazy."The shooting occurred at around 4:22 a.m. on Monday, according to Police Commissioner William Bratton.The two victims — an 18-year-old and 20-year-old — were in stable condition in a hospital, according to CNN. Neither had identified the shooter, according to the New York Daily News.The New York Daily News said the 22-year-old man was taken into custody and charged with assault with a dangerous weapon."The suspect has been identified as 22-year-old Alexander Bonds. He was arrested on assault with a dangerous weapon charges. He was transported to Bellevue Hospital Center for treatment," Bratton said in a statement.Bratton said the male victim was on the phone with his girlfriend when he got off the train at the Bedford Avenue stop, which is in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn.The suspect allegedly came out of the subway car and began arguing with him as he began to walk toward his girlfriend, police said.The suspect told him to take a "personal security" device, Bratton said at a Monday afternoon press conference, but he refused.He allegedly took the phone and returned to get the gun, which he shot once, hitting Bonds in the neck, Bratton added."It looks like he was trying to help his girlfriend when he was shot," Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Rains told reporters, according to the New York Daily News.A gun was recovered and a search of the subway car revealed additional weapons during the investigation, according to Bratton.
Dogs may be the best ambassadors of their species. They show how well we can communicate with humans, they help us understand the world, and they help us feel connected to others. We can learn even more when we work with them to train them.The more dogs are trained the better they are able to understand their owners, the more their owners have confidence in them, and the better they are able to interact with their owner's partner or humans in general.The best training for dogs starts while they are puppies. Puppies are able to understand their intentions, be more motivated, and are generally more understanding of their owners' needs.As they get older, you can try to help your dog understand more. You should take time to train him or her and get the most out of each sessions. As your dog gets older you can increase the time he or she spends with you during your weekly training sessions.One of the ways you can help your dog with conditioning is using food reinforcement. Food can be used to reinforce good behavior, and it can also be used on unimportant behaviors in dogs.I want to give you 2 methods so you can train your puppy or dog to do tricks quickly. If you are not confident about using food without consequences, then just give the dog a treat every time he or she does a good trick. This will teach your dog very quickly and it won't have any long term issues with behavior or obedience.The other method is to use food reinforcement only during the training session. When you get home, before putting your dog in his kennel, give the dog some food. This will help the dog feel special. Once in the kennel, give your dog a treat each time you see him make a mistake. This will reinforce good behavior.The way they work well for training is to reward your dog, even if you mistake him for another dog that has done the same trick. If you use a reward only before and after the mistake, the dog will only be reminded to try harder. If the wrong dog has done a trick, but you think the right one did, the dog might learn to worry more about the correct dog.Remember to give your dog the opportunity to stop training if he is not working hard enough. The rewards you may give your dog are not always as effective as you think they are. This is because they are too soon after a mistake. By giving the dog a treat every time he makes a mistake after the mistake, you are trying to "correct" the dog for the mistake. To help prevent the mistakes, use a shorter reward. For example, give the dog a cookie after he or she has just done a big mistake. Use this as a reminder to be sure you have completed this training session.If your dog is excited when he or she makes a mistake, he might be more likely to do the same trick again. Your dog will also likely show more interest in the right toy if it is on the floor. The first time you have your dog play with the toy in his kennel, you may give him or her no treats. Don't give your pup a treat unless he or she has been given one twice before. If your dog is in the act of performing the trick when the reward is given, reward the dog if only the toy is moved. Only reward the dog if you are sure that the toy is in close proximity.If your dog gets excited when you give him a cookie, don't give your dog extra treats. Instead, wait until your dog comes. When you have your dog ready, give your dog a cookie. Repeat this until your dog is satisfied when you put the cookie away.Now on to the trick training.The first step in training your dog to perform a trick is to teach him or her the trick first. A lot of people have difficulty working with a dog if they don't start off with a familiar behavior.For example, you must have seen a dog perform a trick before you can train him to perform it, so it is best to pick a behavior that your dog easily knows. If you choose to do tricks with him, then it becomes easier to create a routine for training when you can remember to do them.A simple trick to quickly train a dog is the fetch. It is a simple fetch where your dog sits, grabs an object, then returns to his original position. Dogs usually do it in the dog park or on a leash, but that doesn't really matter. It is easy enough to teach a dog to sit and fetch at home if you have a dog park nearby.This is easy enough for a dog to do on his own – just sit and grab an object – but if you want to put the dog in the training environment, you will need to use a treat on each fetch.To do this, first you are going to bring your dog to the dog park
A new video from the National Park Service in Washington, D.C., features an activist who makes it clear that her main goal is not to protect the monuments themselves, but to take them away from the federal government."My mission as an activist is not to protect this land," she says. "I do not care about the monuments, and will never care about the monuments.""I just want these monuments to go back to the states and back to the people," she says. "I believe in local control, and I believe in local democracy. That's the reason why I don't want to protect these monuments.""So you have a political ideology that's anti-monument and pro-states?" a reporter asks her."No, I'm pro-states," she replies.She is one of the protesters at the Washington Monument on the National Mall today, one of several groups who have gathered to prevent the federal government from taking over a collection of monuments that contain some of our country's most treasured cultural elements, some of which are under threat from development, overfishing and climate change.The group also includes artists, writers, historians and students, who are trying to rally lawmakers and the public to protect them.For the record, it's the same government that is now threatening to sell off thousands of acres of Montana's national parks, if Congress doesn't come up with a solution for the $300 million annual cost.And even though federal laws now require that most of these lands be sold off, the Obama administration is refusing to move forward with a plan that would sell off hundreds of millions of acres — including some of the most iconic land.But now, thanks to these anti-monument activists, there is a new effort to change the debate. A new video produced by the National Park Service for the Washington Post's website includes an activist who makes it clear that her primary goal is not to protect this land, but to take them away from the federal government."People are being fooled by their politicians, but I'm not. My mission as an activist is not to protect this land, and I will never care about the monuments, and will never care about the monuments," she says."I'm just here to be a citizen and to be a voice for local politics."Watch below:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtbKpS4FmJE#t=957The National Park Service has been in the news lately over its handling of illegal protests near some of its monuments, as well as the controversial plans to sell off hundreds of thousands of acres of Montana lands."The reality is it's not about the land — it's about politics," John Walsh, senior director of public lands for the National Park Foundation, tells the Washington Post. "The land has been under federal control for 250 years. To take it away from the people is going to shake the core. People are saying, 'Why will they do that?' Because people in Washington want to grab power.""This isn't about the land, it's about federal politics," says Pat Harrison, a park guide."This is one of the greatest places on the face of the Earth, and when federal politics gets involved it's not about the land. There's always been a fight over the land — whether it's a park, a road, an old mining road. And they want to take it away and use that land for the purposes for which it was created," she says."This is going on before our eyes in this nation right now. I mean, we're talking about history right now. We're talking about our history, and we're having to fight for the people to make sure these things survive."Watch the video below:
I've been really into the concept of "micro-blogging," that is, having a number of posts that will be up just to a few people at a time, maybe not all in one go, but perhaps a few per day. To use more of a specific example, I've been blogging about my new house from home gig on the microblogging service, Blogging.fm. I've been interested in micro-blogging since I was very young, and I've always thought, "I've never been able to blog, I've always needed a platform to put my thoughts and feelings and thoughts on!" I have been in the process of buying and relocating to a new home in the Bay Area and have been making lots of new friends in the process, and one of these new friends lives a couple of blocks from me and so has become a regular reader of my blog. He likes the idea of using some of his time, and so he agreed to join in the fun of posting on micro-blogging, just to give me a little of his personal experience with doing so.One day, out of the blue, his wife, Amanda and I get this email:Hi All, Thanks for reading our home site. We are very excited to have you join our community. We are hoping that you feel encouraged to share some of your home life stories and maybe take home some advice or tips. We are a very close knit group of people and so hopefully you will feel comfortable bringing your own experience with your current home. Please feel free to post just about your experience, what you do for work, hobbies, your travel plans, anything in between, just about. So if you have a question, don't be afraid to ask and hope you find this a fun place.He wrote back a couple weeks later, adding this lovely note to the mix:If you're not familiar with Blogging.fm, they have a way of letting you put up a "micro blog" for around $10. It's a great way to introduce a new friend to your town or city, or for a couple of friends to get together for a chat over coffee. I also thought it would be fun to start up a micro-blog of my new home. If anyone reads this, please send us an email at home@home.blogging.fm with a link (I'd be happy to credit you!) to your micro-blog and we'll add it to the site. Thanks,BenSo here are six of his entries for your reading pleasure; I've been trying to track down more people who have micro-blogged from one or a few locations to get them to write their own entries, and have found one so far. I wonder if they'll give back to this great community of micro-bloggers.

(AP Image)(CNSNews.com) – A recent study by the Department of Agriculture finds that the proportion of U.S. farm families with children in families raising incomes of at least $100,000 in 2011 fell by nearly 50 percent from 1970 and the rate of fall accelerated in the past decade.According to the USDA report released in July, which examines income levels and poverty rates for farmers, the poverty rate among farm families rose from just under 31 percent in 1970 to 33.9 percent in 2011, according to the USDA figures.It's important to note that all farm families comprise a family of some value, not just owners and operators of farms. There is a lot of uncertainty about farming's family situation, and there's little real understanding of its relationship with the broader U.S. economy.However, the trend of families dropping out of the farming workforce continues. According to the USDA, between 2000 and 2010, the unemployment rate for workers under 25 in the U.S. agricultural sector rose from 5 to 6.1 percent, while the national rate of youth unemployment was 17.6 percent.The USDA report says that the percentage of female farmers and ranchers has risen significantly as a result of increased production in the early and mid-20th century, but the percentage of married women farmers remains the same as in the 1970s. In 1970, women made up less than half of all male farm workers. By 2011, the number fell to 48.5 percent. By comparison, men made up 67.7 percent of male farm workers.Among those female farmers are new parents, women aged 45 and older, and married mothers.The proportion of families having children in family income levels of at least 75 percent of the federal poverty level fell from 33.9 percent in 70s to 21 percent in 2010. The percentage of families with children making over $115,000 in 2011, meanwhile, rose from 7.9 percent in 1970 to 11.4 percent in the current recession-influenced "farm bust."The share of farmers, ranchers, and other agricultural professionals not married with children fell significantly in the past decade, reaching 20.8 percent in 2010 from 26.9 percent in 2000. For those with children, the number rose from 6.8 percent to 8.4 percent.Among families in which a man is the only wage earner, the percentage of those in households with earnings exceeding the poverty level or at least 30 percent of the poverty level has stayed around 11 percent.But for all other farm families, the numbers have fallen by roughly 60 percent, from 23.2 percent in 70s to 14.8 percent in 2010.
As previously reported , Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. is returning in a big way this upcoming winter with the return of the show's first official series finale, and, if we're being honest, we're excited. But the big news of the night may lie in the way the episode was filmed. According to a new report, the production of the January 15th episode was not just shot entirely on Apple's iPhone 6, it was actually filmed on it.The reason for this seemingly surprising announcement is twofold: first and foremost, Apple's cameras are one of the most advanced and most reliable on the market. And, second and no less incredibly, Apple is an iPhone owner , so it has a stake in promoting the quality of its device. All things equal, this makes a lot more sense than Marvel Studios' decision recently to not include the iPhone 6 in its next big production movie , The Avengers .This isn't only the latest addition to the evidence that the production of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. has been well and truly underway this summer on Apple's own terms, but it's also a huge endorsement of Apple's products. Apple has, after all, been in the mobile video game, and its iPhone 6 will undoubtedly be a popular device when it launches next month. So maybe, after all, it's Marvel fans who should be thanking Apple for all of its help.The next episode of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. is available for streaming on September 20th at 6 pm EST on ABC.
What do you think about when you think about the American flag?Do you tend toward a patriotic view or a flag-waving one?As the United States marks its 241st birthday on Sunday, one group, the Sons of the Union Veterans of America, is raising new questions about the meaning of the flag.It asked some veterans in a series of interviews this week whether the country could stand for any other reason.Related: Confederate flag is flying above Mississippi's state capitol"I was born at Fort Snelling after its surrender to the Union during the winter of 1864," Jim Womack, 92, of St. Paul, said Thursday.

Frémont's Confederate invasion of the West."I was a young kid, about 4 years-old, and I remember how important my parents were to getting us there," Womack said. "But when we got there, and we could see how the country had been torn apart."The soldiers who fought that battle fought for the right to own slaves in areas the government couldn't reach, or didn't want to fight for, such as the North."They were on the side of slavery," Womack said. "My heart went to them. It would be hard to look them in the eyes and say, 'That's our country.' I don't think we can."That line of thinking has come under fire from critics, though, as it draws criticism of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. In his own autobiography, Davis praised his "good friend and faithful soldier in the Mexican war." Davis never ordered Confederate soldiers to attack Fort Snelling; he made all of the Union soldiers there do so, which left Fort Snelling defenseless.The Sons of the Union Veterans of America says it is a "non-partisan, non-religious organization" dedicated to patriotism, service and independence for all Americans.Related: Confederate flag now flying outside Missouri's state capitol"We're not going to question the reasons why our veterans went to war...or if our veterans should ever go to war. We're not saying that's the right thing for each person to do, but we're also not saying that's not what our vets should do," said Stephen L. Wilkins, the organization's spokesman.While some of the group's members aren't willing to embrace the change in the flag's design, or take a new approach to honoring America's veterans, there's no doubt about the impact of the veterans."Some people say you're being too critical, but I disagree," Womack said. "We were brought into a nation that was built on the promise of freedom. And that promise was violated over a lot of the time, so for us, we should take care of America and what it stands for."
In the final minutes of their 2016-17 season, the Pittsburgh Penguins had to be thinking about the future while the New York Rangers, despite coming off a playoff appearance, were still looking ahead.So, the Penguins and Rangers decided their best course of action was to trade their second- and third-round picks in the 2017 NHL Draft, first-round and fourth-round picks in 2018, and a pick in 2019 and their 2017 second and third-round picks in 2017 for New York's fourth-round pick in 2018.Now, the Penguins will select second-year right wing David Perron. The Rangers will get the other Penguins pick."It's been an interesting day, because our whole outlook was, let's get this move made because we think we have good young players," Penguins general manager Jim Rutherford said. "And we don't need to panic too much but we don't want to be on the clock too much because if we wait on picks, it's going to be a long wait, we'd rather have them now."The Penguins were at the Rangers' GM development camp this past season and asked about Perron and about future picks."We said we wouldn't trade those picks, but obviously he came up and we've been looking at it, what does that mean? That doesn't mean we're looking to trade them, but certainly if we get the opportunity with another GM or another team, there's a lot of ways we'd take them. We'd have no problem taking a fourth- and second-round pick in the first round," Penguins general manager Jim Rutherford said.Rutherford also said that a trade is "not likely," but "there will be some trades that are done this summer."Perron started the 2016-17 season strong, but suffered a lower body injury in January. He stayed on the shelf for five weeks, returning in March before being a healthy scratch on February 5 in Dallas versus Chicago. Perron then became a healthy scratch two weeks later against Florida. He has not been at even strength in a Penguins uniform since that game.A few more minutes of news and notes, as we head into the final hour of the Pens-Rangers matchup.The Penguins now take on the Rangers in Game 6 of the Eastern Conference Final.

(CNN) -- A Chinese woman has made a Guinness World Record for the most people held in captivity by the Chinese government without being executed.Li Wei, 38, held the prisoners for seven years as a bodyguard for the late billionaire Li Ka-shing, who is believed to have invested billions in projects in the impoverished area.It was her second attempt to break the record, and Li said she spent nearly 70 minutes in the basement of a military compound in the Shanxi province that housed many of the people detained by Li's family in the early 2000s."I spent seven years to save them," she told CNN as she described her experience. She said some of the prisoners' relatives paid her $1,000 to let them free.Photos: Li Wei holds up a record for Chinese-AmericansThe record was set at around midnight on Friday by another woman, Chen Jinhai, on the same grounds, the Guinness World Records said."It is extremely courageous to stand against the torture and inhuman treatment of a person in such a dangerous environment. The courage with which she was able to speak publicly is admirable," said Liu Jieyi, a spokesperson for the Guinness World Records."It is unfortunate that Ms. Li chose to remain silent for so long. It would have been wiser for her to disclose the facts, particularly about what happened to the prisoners and their family members."She also called on the Chinese government to change its policies regarding political detainees.Li Wei's story emerged to Western media in July and became a cause celebre for those who advocate on behalf of political detainees worldwide.She was held in connection with her father, Li Kunfeng, a Chinese businessman, and his daughter, Li Wei, now a professor at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.The record-breaking news was posted on a Chinese-language site, according to the Guinness World Records Web site.The site also posted the Chinese government's denial of the claim."The Chinese government has made no official statement yet regarding the new record. We will wait for official word to come to know its exact authenticity," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said Wednesday.On the same site, American photographer Jim Cooke was reporting that "there was no bodyguard on duty who would turn a person over to a cell block for a beating," but his interview with Li was later deleted.After her release from prison last September it emerged that Li, who is a member of the country's pro-democracy movement, had spent seven years as an inmate.The record is not intended to be used as an excuse to release prisoners from detention, Amnesty International said."It is wrong for anyone to use the record as an excuse for torture or other ill treatment," said Li, who is single, in a brief interview with CNN.
This paper describes the development of a simple and powerful non-invasive quantitative method of measuring serum testosterone levels in young men, based on quantitative and qualitative measurements of the hormone's bioavailable and free fractions. An increase in serum testosterone concentration (increase in AUC) of <6.0 ng/dl was achieved through use of an isotope-based assay with a time limit of 6 days. Total testosterone and free testosterone were determined using different isotope ratios based on mass-spectrometric techniques and mass detection. Quantitative analyses of free and bioavailable fractions revealed that free testosterone significantly increased by 20 to 28% in response to the first month and also increased by an additional 28 to 33% after 6 weeks of an oral supplementation program. Moreover, the isotope-based method yielded a nonlinear relationship with free testosterone, and that this nonlinear relationship was not significantly altered by the use of different isotopes of testosterone. Thus, the isotope technique may be suitable as a basis for clinical clinical measurements and may be useful in research studies.The study population consisted of 28 healthy volunteers, aged 18 to 35 years, and 14 men receiving testosterone therapy (11 men in testosterone treatment and 15 in placebo), who were followed up for 8 weeks after starting the study. Each subject received oral supplementation with a single dose of 10-120 mg of testosterone (15 mg/day) and a placebo, and testosterone levels were measured on two separate mornings at the end of the last day of placebo administration and at the beginning of the last day of testosterone supplementation.There are four common forms of hormone-induced testosterone deficiency and testosterone deficiency (T4). Form E of primary testosterone deficiency is associated with low testomax (free and bioavailable testosterone) and low plasma testosterone concentrations. The other form, Form D of subfertility and a decrease in serum testosterone are associated with a fall in free testosterone concentration ( 7 ). The other form of testosterone deficiency, androgen deficiency in aging, is associated with decreased serum androgen concentrations ( 8 ). Of the forms of testosterone deficiency, the most common are primary androgen deficiency or subfertility. However, one of the reasons for using the term testosterone deficiency is that it is possible to produce a deficiency of different forms if testosterone does not reach the required amount, for example, in hypogonadotrophic men, androgens are not produced at a sufficient quantity or in enough quantity during the development of a testosterone deficiency ( 9 , 10 ).Low testosterone levels occur in most men and the symptoms of low testosterone are often associated with the presence of the androgenic steroid dihydrotestosterone (DHT) or with the presence of prostaglandin D 2 (PGD 2 ) ( 1 - 4 ). Low testosterone is the main form of testosterone deficiency, resulting either from a decreased production of DHT or DHT production is suppressed by androgenic medications. DHT is the most potent anabolic hormone in human body and exerts its androgenic action through several mechanisms. It binds to androgen receptors and androgen receptors and has a half-life of 4 to 7 h, or it binds to androgen receptor in the cytoplasmic membrane of both type I and type II nuclear receptors and has a half-life of 24 to 36 h ( 2 ). Low levels of serum DHT are due to both decreased production and/or decreased binding to androgen receptors in normal men ( 5 ). DHT is the androgenic precursor to FSH and can stimulate the follicular growth of the androgen receptor-negative follicle ( 6 ).Hormone levels of individual subjects were compared by using Student's t test for comparisons between groups or Kruskal-Wallis tests for comparisons between individuals. Differences among subgroups were analyzed by Mann-Whitney U tests. Results were considered significant at p < 0.05 and when p < .01.Analyses were performed using commercially available software versions of the SAS-program (version 9.3) ( SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). The two measurements used in the present study were measured on separate mornings using an Olympus BX-70 microscope. These were placed in a holder with a 1.5-mm filter attached and an 11.5-GHz microwave receiver set to a nominal frequency of 20 MHz. The measurements were made using an isotope-based assay of serum testosterone ( 12 ) and an isotope ratio mass spectrometric method of a ratio of the two major concentrations: total testosterone and free testosterone.Hormone concentrations of each participant were calculated by using hormone-based hormone assays ( 17 ) on the Roche Diagnostics Analytical Reagents System 7.12 (Leiden, The Netherlands). Samples of the serum were immediately freeze-dried, mixed with an organic solvent and centrifuged at 14,500 g for 10 min at 4 °C then resuspended in a 0.19-ml vial (with 1.9-mm lid and 0.5
As a result, the city has begun the process of hiring a new police chief and putting up a $2.5 million bond to begin preliminary work in the future in anticipation of more crime."We're going to focus on the immediate challenges here," Jackson said. "It's important to focus at this point on those issues that we understand are the challenges within the city of Dallas."City leaders have tried to convince critics of the plan that having all of the money from the bond money in the city's wallet and not spent on other things would improve the situation."It is a good idea, but the biggest thing to remember with this is that it's not the entire $6.5 million we put the city on the line for," Johnson said. "We're going to spend $5 million for crime control and $2.5 million to hire a new chief."The city would get $1 million each for the new chief and for security upgrades to city streets. The police chief would also be responsible for hiring additional officers to work on crime issues.The money comes from a 2006 voter-approved bond issue for a total of $50 million, and was put on the November ballot as Measure D, which would have raised about $1 billion for transportation and infrastructure projects.
This is not about the future of the NFL. This is not about whether the Rams can or will move to Los Angeles. This is about the future of the state of California.This is about the future of democracy and the relationship between its citizens and its governing bodies. This is about the future of all of us.By the end of the week, it's reasonable to expect that a resolution on the Rams lease proposal will be reached. For now, let's celebrate this one-year anniversary of the Rams' move to L.A.One year ago Sunday, the Rams and Raiders announced that they would play in Los Angeles for two consecutive years. While the two sides will likely meet for another meeting in the coming weeks, a resolution still is forthcoming.The Rams, Rams, Rams. The two franchises will now be playing in the City of Angels for just one more year, which is just as thrilling to us fans as the first year is to them. We are fortunate and privileged to have both this year and in future years.Now that the Rams have gone, what will happen to USC? Will the Los Angeles Unified School District be allowed to stay in its current location? What will happen when USC's two years are up? Is it possible that the Rams could be back?You may even have an answer to these questions that the media's inability to come up with one will never tell us.What can you do as a California citizen to ensure that both the Rams and the USC football team stay in Los Angeles?Let's hear from you in the comments.

BOULDER — The University of Colorado has released five details of its $50 million plan to improve safety and security next spring for football and other events on campus.The plan, which would require a bond issue to provide the cash, is intended to improve and protect the safety and well-being of CU faculty, staff and students from dangerous incidents, including car break-ins and home break-ins. The plan includes a campuswide awareness, education, enforcement and intervention program.The proposal has been met with skepticism from some faculty members who say the plans are too expensive and unproven. Others argue that CU is overdoing security because it gets negative publicity.The cost estimates include a $2 million annual campus-wide security plan and a $2.5 million monthly security plan for individual buildings, CU spokesman Bronson Hilliard said.The campus-wide plan calls for a "safety net" for CU's 2,068 students that would include an intercom system for dorms, a security guard, 24-hour surveillance on stairwells and elevators and an additional security patrol within one-and-one-half hours of the doors to CU's residences opening.Campus safety, according to the plan, also includes increased campus awareness and awareness of security procedures such as not leaving cars in parking garages overnight and walking in groups.The new program will also include a "prevention, intervention and education" program for students of color, who are targeted with the most violent acts of property crime among CU's four minority groups, Hilliard said.The $50 million, 10-year plan also calls for increased patrols of campus neighborhoods, increased campus awareness for students and faculty and faculty at CU, the creation of a new position that oversees the campus's public safety operations, and the hiring and retention of 200 law enforcement officers.UCLA economist and safety expert Dr. Christopher J. Johnson, a CU associate vice chancellor for strategic planning, also is a co-author of the campus plan, which calls for hiring more law enforcement officers.In a meeting with campus news media last week, university President Bruce Benson announced a new position — dean of students and community health — to oversee all CU's campus health services.On Feb. 16, CU will begin the process of developing a new safety and security plan for athletic events, beginning with the Buff and Buffs games.Benson said the $49 million cost is a low estimate for the plan because it doesn't include additional hiring needed to handle security for other non-sports events.The new plan is to replace a 2002 plan that had not been updated since 1998."The University has no choice. Safety in our community and elsewhere will not be a spectator sport and the best way to ensure safety is to change the system of protection and protection from which we receive it," Benson said Friday.CU student Jordon Pfeffer is a member of the Colorado Faculty Association and the Denver Public Library board.As chairman of the CU Advisory Committee on Faculty Security, he said he supports the proposed campus Safety & Security Plan."The security in this document is in line with what I expect CU to require," Pfeffer said Friday.Jared Leicht, assistant chief of police for CU's Police Department, said the department will be working with the department of transportation, CU police, the Boulder Police Department and other agencies as the plan is formulated.Police Chief Mark Beckner said he has been involved in the process of reviewing the plan for a year."I think the plan addresses some of the concerns the community and student body have about us, our police department and security. This plan is going to be a good one," Beckner said Friday.In an era with increasing online crime, CU students should expect increased security on campus, as more and more people will now have access to their digital records, he said."We're certainly going to be working with the CU Police Department to make sure we work as best we can in response to the potential of that and other forms of crime," he said.But some university staffers who work in the library, residence halls and other public spaces expressed skepticism about the plans.Dana Zaytseb, who has worked in CU's public safety program for six years, said most of the public safety initiatives are geared toward increasing police presence that can prevent crimes."The public safety efforts are generally focused on trying to prevent crime and then responding after the fact," she said.She questioned whether the proposed safety and security initiatives would be enough because there are few high-profile, visible crimes occurring on campus."I'd be concerned about the number and quality of resources," she said. "We can't afford to have two or five or six officers at a location at a time. There must be resources of all kinds, and
FULLERTON - Crews worked Thursday morning to clear snow and ice from the I-5 overpass at the Newport Freeway near the Huntington Beach border.An estimated 1,600 gallons of water was required in the process.The work, including crews clearing rock debris from underneath the overpasses, was expected to be finished early Friday.
I've spent some time exploring a number of web frameworks with PHP and have found it rather hard to write good code with them. In particular, I am currently working on a very large project which leverages a framework, so, I'd like to share my thoughts on this process and how you might go about using one.PHP is an incredibly fast PHP runtime, and some people claim it's the fastest ever. PHP has a vast array of tooling (some of which you can even get for free with GitHub) to help you implement, design, compose, and debug complex PHP applications. The language is extremely stable and well documented. The code examples in this post will all be in plain-text. This allows anyone to take the code and try out different implementations or even make sure code isn't overly verbose in their code. I have also added a link to my personal website to this code section.PHP is easy for beginners to write because it comes with syntax highlighting, a very simple REPL, and a powerful debugger. This is an incredibly powerful language to start using, and you can get a good feel for it just by using it. You can use the very powerful phpMyAdmin web tool to manage your database with PHP, and there is a growing PHP community where you can interact with other programmers and discuss PHP-related topics.My Experience Using Frameworks in PHPBefore I start trying to build a framework, let me share some of the frustrations I've been having with using frameworks in my projects. To get to my problems, I'll just show my code in this post without any PHP framework:<?php $id = "myid"; // myid=$id $name = $id . "_" . $_POST [ "user" ] [ "name" ]; // name=$id . $_POST[ 'user' ][ 'name' ]; // name=id.name $age = $name . " is " . $age || 2_33; // age=name.age $user = new User(array( "id" => $id, "name" => $name, "age" => $age, "required" => true, "email" => $email )); // user = new User().$value // => {"id": ["myid"], "name": {"_": ["myname"}, "age": {"is": "2_33"}, "required": true}, // user=new User().$new }The PHP error I received on the last line is:Error: The PHP statement is deprecated: '$new' in PHP 5.6.7.This shows you that the function "new" wasn't declared anywhere in the code I was writing. I'd like to use it, and I could declare it in the class, but I don't want to do this. I also didn't use the "// ... }" line. This doesn't bother me (I don't remember the last time I used it when coding in other languages) and it's not a coding faux pas. It's just not the right way to declare your function.I was also using PHP's variable array syntax which allowed me to access this type of data, but I was not returning anything from my function (although I'd really like to be returning it). Since I wasn't returning something from the function, I couldn't access the array variable. You can see this in the error:// ...PHP is also not good at object-oriented programming. You need to either "new" it or "call" it before you can use its methods.The PHP I chose to do my work with is Yii, a very powerful PHP framework built on the Zend Framework. I wanted to use the Yii framework because there were PHP libraries that supported it, but I didn't want to have to set up everything.Yii, on the other hand, is built on Zend Framework, which in turn supports other libraries. That means it's easy to have the library you want, but it doesn't mean it supports you if you don't have it in the library you want. I couldn't easily add my package to Yii's repository because Zend doesn't support that yet.To be honest, I was using PHP version 5.0.8 without PHP's "extends" feature. I was using Zend's "extends" and when that died out, I stopped using it entirely. It was because of other dependencies, specifically the PHP extensions required to use Symfony2's Dancer (Dancer is a popular PHP web framework).There are a few solutions for your dependency problems such as:Use a "virtual host" plugin.Use Zend Framework's Composer.Use Bower.With any given framework, you also have to deal with some issues as well. I had
The first episode of the second season of Orange is the New Black is up at Netflix, and it's another fantastic episode of the original show.Let's have a look at some of the show's more unusual moments!1. I Know Why the Caged Can't TalkI was disappointed at first, but then I realized that's how they get you: a bit of torture that gets you to confess.From episode 1: "Creamsicles"2. The Bathroom and ThatThere may or may not be a bathroom at Litchfield. But is there a toilet at Litchfield?From episode 6: "Unincorporated"So there's a toilet at Litchfield. Maybe there's a bathtub at Litchfield? Maybe not. And that's because there aren't. Or, maybe there is a bathroom in Litchfield, but no toilet in it. Who knew?!From episode 8: "The Library"3. The New York Times is a Good News Machine"You may be reading the New York Times, but it's just reading you!"From episode 10: "The Kitchen"From episode 11: "Red"4. What's the Big Deal?There's no "big thing" in prison. Unless you're dealing with a bad man, who would be considered a big deal in prison, just like in real life. But if you get a bad man, then it's a HUGE deal!From 4-10: "The Library" (episode 1), "Red" (episode 10), "Blackout" (episode 11), "U-turn" (episode 12)5. The T-Shirt GuyThat's not the normal shirt guy. That's the guy with some sort of t-shirt that reads "I AM P.O.V."From episode 2: "Ties"6. I'm not a Litchfield CharacterI was not a Litchfield character at all!7. And I'm Not Getting OutLitchfield is not a good place to go to jail. You'll be killed by the state of California, probably be tortured, and probably die. Oh, and you'll spend several months in prison.8. The Biggest Little HoleLitchfield is not as far from Brooklyn as they thought. And not much bigger, either. Not the size of Manhattan. And not the size of New York City. But it does seem smaller, and with a big hole in it, you could fit a couple thousand people.From episode 8: "Lunch"9. Tensions in the Litchfield QuarterLitchfield has a little more tension than most of Litchfield, mainly because it's in the middle of nowhere. From episode 1: "The Kitchen"10. The Prisoner of LitchfieldThis one is a real beauty. A prisoner gets a little bit of freedom in Litchfield, but is still considered guilty. We then hear that prison rape is a HUGE deal, and the entire prison is looking at a prisoner. This is just a wonderful scene. And the prisoner is actually a man. This is an important scene for the show. And it's also one of the few times on the show that Piper and Alex really get to be like "we are all one big family." This is their "Piper and Alex in the big house", and they give each other good comfort and happiness despite everything.From 6-10: "The Library" (episode 5), "Lunch" (episode 1), "The Library" (episode 8), "Red" (episode 1), "The Library" (episode 9)I'd love to see them follow through with this ending. There's no way that prison rape would be the defining moment of the series. But even if it was, I think Orange is the New Black should be able to continue to explore and explore, and go outside of being a prison drama. I also think that maybe they could make the entire prison into an actual prison, and have prisoners living in and out of cells (like they do on the show). Maybe they could even get rid of the walls (or just have a different set of prison rules), and just have prisoners living in the cell with them. Who knows?If the show continues, I hope they give us more episodes like this. After all, they only have 18 episodes, for crying out loud!Now, get out there and watch the show! Season 3 seems to be coming soon!
The latest research by the Pew Research Center shows that a higher percentage of millennials (those born between 1980 and 2000) view Islam as "anti-democratic" than those who were born in the 1960s and 1970s."We've had people talk about this generation's political views, it's not something we normally see. We have this perception that this generation is just like other generations. However, we see that their views, especially on the question of Islam, really are quite different," said Paul Taylor, co-author of the research and a professor of religious studies at Rice University, Houston. He said that when it comes to Islam, people born in the 1960s and 70s see it as just like other religions, while millennials see it as less consistent with American values."We have people talking about this generation's political views. It's not something we normally see," said Taylor, speaking to students at an invitation-only lunch in Houston that was sponsored by The American Enterprise Institute. "We have this perception that this generation is just like other generations. However, we see that their views, especially on the question of Islam, really are quite different."Millennials are the least religious generation in the history of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. This generation has a higher percentage of religiously unaffiliated adults when compared with their older siblings (66% compared with 55%), said Pew. Millennials are more likely to believe "that only those who believe in God and follow a set of religious rules can be fully trusted." According to the research, 70% of Millennials claim they never pray.The Pew research is based on an 18-month Gallup survey conducted between January 2012-June 2013 of more than 3,600 people by the firm's Daily Tracking Panel. The sample is nationally representative of all Americans age 18 and older."We're seeing that they are more than just having more faith," Taylor said. "They're less satisfied with how things are going in the country, they're questioning government as the protector of people, and they've also said they want to take a more active role in the political process, so we have the opposite of what we would think of them as saying we've just gotten older."The survey showed that "being religious" is not as important to millennials as in their parents' generation. The study showed that only 39% of young people who call themselves religious believe "that religion is very important" in their lives."They're interested in religion. They really are. But they're not religious the way they once were," Taylor said.The survey also showed that people in most parts of the U.S. believe Obama's Muslim faith is the most important thing in his life. Fifty-seven percent of respondents said Obama's Muslim religion was most important to him, along with 45% of Republicans and 35% of Democrats. Respondents were asked how important they considered his Muslim faith to Obama. Fifty-seven percent said they considered Islam to be very important, according to the study. The study did not include questions about religion in the survey nor whether respondents knew if Obama is a Christian.There is also disagreement on whether President Obama is a Christian or not, according to the study. Fifty-eight percent of respondents said Obama is a Muslim, compared with 42% who said he's a Christian. Twenty-one percent of respondents said he is a "Jew" and 28% said "a non-Christian" or "none." Only 5% admitted that they do not know if Obama is a Christian.The Pew Research Center has been conducting public polling about faith since 2007, with more than 16,000 Americans participating in previous survey. The study asked respondents about a variety of religious beliefs, but the results do not distinguish between those who believe in the Christian God and those who do not believe.The research has been published in The American Prospect.
If you are anything like me, this is like your worst enemy, but at a certain level, you have to learn to accept it as a necessary evil.So, here is the deal: you need to have an emergency fund, and you have to save the minimum amount in each pay period (if you work). You also need to save whatever you can from all your paycheck, because there will be some portion that you will have to come up on your income or have to pay in tax.Why?It's not like my employer would cut me any checks that I didn't have an emergency fund. If they wanted me to keep any portion of my pay, they'd have to go through my 401k to get it (but they could cut me or freeze my 401k entirely, or give me a 401k contribution and some matching, or give me some choice between 401k and IRA contributions, etc…).So where is that money going to come from?It's going to come from saving (or not) a significant portion of my paycheck (I know I could have saved some more, but it still isn't good enough). It is also going to come from the "in-between" pay periods, where you pay yourself a little while you work, but not enough to have enough in your emergency fund to cover two weeks of living expenses if you got laid off.There are many ways to do this (I'm not here to tell you how to save or how to manage your money, just how to do it). Here are what have worked for me, plus a few things you may want to consider…Paying Yourself FirstIn-between pay periods, it's best to pay yourself FIRST!It's important that you spend as much of your paycheck on your own stuff as possible. If you have to go to a friends house, buy them some drinks, or buy yourself something then that's an emergency expense. And if you take it that far, then you probably should have saved more or done more.Now, you don't have to buy yourself a new pair of shoes every time you run out of money. But you do need to go shopping or something before you have to find money for food. Or buy yourself a pair of shoes that you like a lot before you go out of pocket for a new pair.But at least do that once a month!Forcing Yourself to SaveWhen you have to pay yourself first, it helps you to put some money away so that you can have some money saved when you need it the most. But sometimes, you just need to save money while you are still working at your day job (it can save you $500 every 2 years!).I do two things when my pay period starts (if I use my paycheck as an emergency fund). First, I make sure I have enough in my emergency fund to pay off $5,000 in debt (or whatever the minimum debt is that I have). Then, I set aside a small part of my paycheck (5% to 10%) for paying down the remaining amount I can afford.Now there is no "right" time to do this – if your paycheck is tight you need to go ahead and pay yourself first, and if your income is growing by $20,000 a year, you might want to start putting a percentage of it on automatic.But at any point, if you have the money there, it's good to have it in your emergency fund.It's easy to make excuses and say "I can't manage an emergency fund because I don't have much money". But the fact of the matter is that you really can.A Few Simple Rules for Savings1. Save more than you earn. It takes a lot of money to make a lot of money, and once you make a lot, it takes a lot of money to save a lot more.2. Save every paycheck as an emergency fund.3. Take your money out and put it to work – especially if you have a long time to live. This means investing in your education, your future, or paying off your debt.4. Save a little bit of everything. Not only will this help keep you from running out of money, it will save your employer money.5. If no amount of "saving" is enough for you, try adding a "stretch goal".This is a simple way to start saving for something or start saving more and more. For example, instead of putting $100 a week into your Emergency Fund, you could put $2000 into it and get $1000 back. This will help you save more every week for longer and longer years.
I have never done any of this, I guess you need to take my word for it. The reason you are all telling me to not do it is because I know it's not the right way to do things, because it causes problems when the time comes and you need to say goodbye. That's just how things go down in your world...if it were me, I'd start thinking of ways to get the job done, but the way it happens in Real Life I think I would have been more of a help that a hindrance. What the hell do you want from me? I don't know. I'm just here, living my life and doing my thing, and hopefully after enough time I can figure things out.
Celiac disease, a type of auto-immune disorder that makes people have an allergic reaction to gluten, may be linked to the risk of depression, according to a new study in the Dec. 6 issue of the journal PLOS ONE.The study, by researchers at Case Western Reserve in Cleveland, identified a possible correlation between people with celiac disease and depression using data from a large national survey of US adults. The results suggest that depression can begin in the absence of signs of celiac disease and may also be caused, in part, by underlying genetic factors.The study, part of the National Institutes of Mental Health's EYE (Epidemiology, Imaging, Genetics and Endocrinology) Study, included almost 3,700 men and women, ages 18 to 70, who were evaluated for depression using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview.The average age at diagnosis was 62.5, and about two in five people had celiac disease. Celiac disease is an immune reaction that causes people to be gluten intolerant and may lead to symptoms such as abdominal cramps, headaches, and diarrhea.In this study, researchers identified seven markers of depression among celiac disease participants, who were divided into four groups — seven who had depressive symptoms and two who did not. The group without depressive symptoms showed no differences in mood or behavior that were found in celiac disease patients who had depressive symptoms.The six markers of depression with the highest correlation to the presence of celiac disease were:Major depressive disorder in people with no gluten sensitivityMajor depressive disorder in people with non-celiac gluten sensitivityDepression in people who had depressionDepression in people who had major depressive disorderDepression in people whose depression was a reaction to glutenThe study showed that five of the six depression markers showed a strong significant association with celiac disease patients without depressive symptoms."There is a lot of research that has shown that the risk for depression is higher in people who have celiac disease, and also in people who have celiac disease but not celiac disease," said Dr. R. Scott Williams, director of neuroimaging and neuropsychology at the Cleveland Clinic Center for Gut Health, who was not involved in the study."What's interesting is that the correlation with depression may not only occur after celiac disease has been diagnosed, but in those who had depressive symptoms as well. This is a possible link between celiac disease and depression that warrants further research."Celiac disease is rare, affecting about one in 100 Americans. In addition to depression, people diagnosed with celiac disease may have other health problems. The symptoms of celiac disease are so mild that most people diagnosed with the disease do not even realize they have the gene."I hope that people who are depressed have found this information very useful and we can start talking to them about how to manage this," said William Fergus Jr., director of research at the Celiac Disease Research Foundation, based in Cleveland."It's not something you should just dismiss out of hand as being a psychological reaction or even 'it's just part of being a celiac' kind of thing. There could be genetic factors that cause what looks to be a mental health disorder."There is currently no approved therapy for celiac disease in the United States."There may be a role for the gluten-free diet for some who think that their depressed mood is caused by food sensitivities. It's important that we not dismiss or push people with depression that have celiac disease that do not have depression," Fergus said.Study co-author Steven Miller, assistant professor of psychiatry at Case Western Reserve, said that more research is needed to determine if there is a relationship between depression and celiac disease, and how it may be affected by other conditions."I can't imagine there's a lot of celiac disease patients out there who are depressed," Miller said.Cancer is a leading cause of death in the United States. Celiac disease is associated with an increased risk of cancer at all sites in the body, such as mouth/throat, colon, rectum, lymph nodes/adenoma, breast, ovary, prostate, colon and lungs."This research adds to the body of evidence that suggests that gluten sensitivity is a significant public health concern and is being diagnosed and treated at alarming rates," said Susan Thixton, director of the Celiac Disease Center of Cleveland Clinic's Center for Gut Health, who was not involved in the research."It also provides important information to parents and caregivers who may not be aware of the potential complications from their gluten sensitivity, and also to clinicians and patients, who can consider asking questions about a person's diet if they show evidence of depression. Parents and caregivers with questions about a patient's diet can speak to their physician."The study will be able improve
On January 16, 2014, we reported the findings of our survey of the top 20 U.S. states for business climates and labor markets, and we announced the survey results in our February 12, 2014 research note. On that note, we also provided key findings from an analysis we did as part of our research into the most important factors influencing labor market outcomes such as those noted in this post.In our previous report, we concluded that the four most important factors for employment and wage trends were:• Unemployment rate: The highest unemployment rates typically come from states with the highest unemployment rates. In fact, states with the fewest unemployment rates tended to have the highest unemployment rates across all measures of unemployment (see Table 1).• Wages: The lower the wages, the worse the job market tends to be. The higher the wages, the better the job market tends to be. The most consistent pattern is that unemployment rates go inversely to wages. The higher the wages, the lower the unemployment rate; in the opposite direction, the lower the wages, the higher the unemployment rate.• Payroll employment: The more workers employed in a state, the stronger the business climate. States with both high rates of business formation and high levels of business productivity tend to have high rates of employment and low unemployment. Conversely, states with low rates of business formation, low levels of business productivity, and high unemployment tend to have low unemployment and high levels of employment.• Business formation: The number of new business establishments increases with an economy's productivity and generates more employment, but more generally the greater the number of small and medium-sized businesses, the better the business climate.• Wages: The more wages workers earn, the better the business climate is. If workers earn 50% more than what they did before, or if they get a big pay bump after joining the workforce, then wages tend to increase more quickly and businesses have more flexibility to hire and keep employees.In our most recent research note, we revisit key findings from our earlier study: we provide more details on the data we used when we tested our findings; we describe our methodology; and we offer a set of conclusions and ideas for future research in terms of policy.Key FindingsWe tested our conclusions by breaking our findings down into five categories. Two categories focus on the top 20 states for business climates and labor markets. Some conclusions in these categories are not in line with the conclusions found that most broadly in our previous report. There are also a few new findings.Business Climate and Labor Markets in the Top 10 States for Business ClimateThe most striking findings from the analyses we did are the differences between business climates in the most-competitive states and those least competitive. It has long been known, for example, that some industries tend to thrive in high-innovation, high-productivity states, while others thrive in less-innovative states. This finding has been well-supported by prior research.But what was not known, until now, was whether this trend held across all industries. We provide evidence from a separate set of analyses we conducted where we considered the most-competitive and least competitive states in each industry.We first examine four categories representing industries as the state's competitiveness is seen through factors such as business formation and business productivity. A key finding is that, while the most competitive states in each industry were in many cases competitive among the overall industries, competitiveness in each industry tended toward the extremes – very competitive in agriculture, the services sector, and the manufacturing sector, and very unprofitable in finance, information technology, finance, and insurance.The most heavily-competitive states in each industry had a median of $32,660 in business profits, which are roughly 10 times greater than the median in the least competitive areas. The most-competitive places in each industry had a median of $15,560 in average gross state product (where GSP is the sum of all state and local taxes, minus transfers from the federal government, minus state and local debt service costs), which is roughly 30 times greater than the median in areas with the fewest companies. And the most-competitive industries in each industry had gross state product that was $1,521,000 or more per employed person, which is roughly 60 times greater than the median in the least competitive areas.Business Climate and Labor Markets in the Top 20 States for Labor MarketWe also test our conclusions about the most competitive states for labor markets. There is little direct evidence from labor markets, although previous research in the area has suggested that those with high shares of jobs paying less than $24,600/year tend to have relatively high unemployment rates (but see here for a discussion of that research). For most industries in all states, the most competitive areas tend to have among the highest levels of employment growth and the lowest unemployment rates relative to the overall employment trend. In all cases, the competitive areas also had
The first season finale of Arrow's third season made quite a few headlines about the future of the show, but that's just one of the things going on behind the scenes this month. Fans were very confused when they received the news that Katie Cassidy wouldn't be back for season four, which is currently being filmed in England. But there was more good news on the horizon as Arrow star Stephen Amell revealed that both Laurel Lance and Quentin Lance will be returning for the show in season four.While speaking to The Hollywood Reporter, Amell said, "I am working on three scripts right now. One that the boys are writing and doing some stuff together with the directors in England, one that Katie is writing and will direct, and one we need to find a way to convince her to come back." He added, "I'm not sure that she'll want to, but we are all really excited to make more of these characters."There are also other returning cast members including Willa Holland (Shay) also confirmed to return to the show and the other half of Diggle & Felicity romance, Katie Cassidy. "I just found out today that both of Laurel's parents are coming and I have to let you know that Katie will be back," Amell told Entertainment Weekly in March. "Kassie [McInnes] and Katie were on the floor of the writers' room and I'm going, 'Holy shit! We're going to have a daughter and a granddaughter on our hands."Arrow will be back, at least for the time being, after the fall finale, in which we'll get to see Diggle and Felicity deal with their parents having a falling out, plus we'll be meeting Thea Queen.
A new series of polls on Monday suggested that an increased focus on economic growth may be winning the battle for voters in the United States against the threat of an insurgent presidential candidate.Among American adults, an ABC News/Washington Post survey found that 55 percent support the idea of tax cuts for the rich. In December 2011, just 27 percent of adults supported such a plan.The poll was conducted among 1,003 adults over the phone from Nov. 23 - Dec. 2, with 3-day rolling averages on an average of registered Republicans and Democrats. (The poll has an error margin of 3 percentage points, meaning an error of plus-or-minus 3 percent might be published.)The shift coincides with the release of the first debate between the candidates on Sept. 26, which will feature a question on the economy. The poll found that 60 percent of likely voters say there should be a debate, an increase from the 54 percent who would like to be able to see the debate.And it mirrors a larger shift by Republican voters. The share of respondents who said it would be good if the party were to make "some kind of effort to improve its economy" increased to 60 percent from 46 percent in December. The last time the share was so high was in October 2012, when 50 percent of registered voters said that GOP policies should be aimed at increasing the job market rather than shrinking it.The question about raising taxes on the wealthy became a popular one in recent years after a series of high-profile debates -- including the "47 percent" comments made by former Gov. Mitt Romney and President Barack Obama. Republicans have blamed such comments for helping President Obama win the debate and thus the election in 2012.It's not just the candidates that voters would like to see tackle the economy. Asked to choose from among several possible economic proposals -- from lower taxes on the wealthy to higher taxes on the wealthy -- 55 percent said some form of tax-code reform was important. That's about twice the 29 percent that said tax cuts for the wealthy were critical.The survey was conducted before the recent release of a New York Times poll showing that 61 percent of likely voters said it was important for the government to make the economy work better, while 36 percent said the federal government should do more to make the economy work.
The Supreme Court is set to hear whether a law that bars those convicted of a violent crime from possessing a weapon, such as a shotgun, requires an ex-felon to register the gun with the state as they would for any new owner.Carmen Carrera, a convicted felon, claims she is unable to use a gun despite having received a court order to do so following her conviction for violating the terms of parole. The law requires convicted felons to complete the registration and background check process every five years, but the California Department of Justice says Carrera's record is clear — the court had not ordered her to do so as it has yet to rule on her petition."She is still unable to own a gun while in California," said Laura Dunn, the lead attorney for Carrera. "She has to use her gun against her will. It's wrong and cruel."The petition argues that the gun ban violates the Second Amendment, under the reasoning of Second Amendment v. Heller, and that California's law can discriminate in violation of the due process clause of the 14th Amendment.The NRA and other gun rights advocacy groups say the court should not rely on gun safety laws to prohibit convicted felons from owning guns."It's no different than requiring every new homeowner to submit to a background check before obtaining a gun. This law is no different," said Dan Gross, president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. "Even if that homeowner is found to have no connection to criminal activity, the state's interest in public safety will trump someone's constitutional rights."Under the court's 2008 decision in Heller, felons are entitled to the right to keep and bear arms in the home, but the court also said states cannot impose such prohibitions without sufficient rational basis.The Supreme Court in Heller said a person convicted of a crime under federal law but not state law cannot use the Second Amendment to argue he shouldn't be barred from ownership, but the Supreme Court has yet to rule on whether a felon convicted of a crime in a state other than California can challenge the law.The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit agreed with the State of California that Carrera did not meet the definition of a "dangerous and habitual criminal" under state law because she wasn't in possession of a gun when she violated her parole in 2009 — when she said she received her gun permit.In a recent court filing, Carrera's attorney argued that although the law is vague and vague definitions are dangerous, the fact that she was able or unable to own a gun before her conviction should be irrelevant to her rights under federal law.Lawyers for the California Department of Justice have asked the Supreme Court to block Carrera's petition, arguing, among other things, that the Supreme Court did not address the right to possess a firearm during a felony sentence.In addition to seeking the court's review, the NRA argues that federal law requires the DOJ to notify gun dealers that firearm dealers cannot take a convicted felon's gun registration without approval of the ATF, something the Gun Rights Act says the department does not have to do.The DOJ has said that it is legally obligated to follow a person's federal law, which is how it got involved, the agency told The Hill last summer."California law requires California residents with felony convictions to register their firearms," read a response from the agency to the NRA. "California law prohibits persons convicted of a crime defined in California law from owning or possessing a firearm. These restrictions apply to all firearms, to include guns formerly owned by convicted felons.""Federal law does not place these restrictions on firearm dealers," the DOJ continued.
The Supreme Court's ruling on the Defense of Marriage Act last week was the first for several years to legalize same-sex marriages nationwide. The U.S. has now been at war in the Middle East for more than thirteen years, killing millions of people. But the issue of gay rights is getting a lot of attention this year, as a growing number of states in the United States allow gay and lesbian couples to marry and become parents. The new state laws are often described as "marriage equality."Some supporters of same-sex marriage worry that the new laws could lead to "civil disorder" because some of the people getting married might reject traditional views on sex, marriage and family life. But there are also reasons to be optimistic about the prospects for "marriage equality." As a new study published in the journal Demography by researchers at the Brookings Institution and University of California at San Diego finds, the legal status of gay and lesbian couples makes it easier for children born to gay and lesbian parents to grow up in homes in which the parents both accept same-sex sexual relationships. As the authors write, "these families are more likely to show strong, if varied, attachment to their children" and "more likely to develop positive relationships with school and community institutions."The authors note that when same-sex couples are granted the same legal status as opposite-sex couples, "children are better off regardless of the gender of their parents." But the benefits accrue only for children born to gay fathers—regardless of which way the family status is flipped. The same holds true for gay mothers—and for all children, regardless of their sexual orientation.When the authors controlled for factors such as family income, religious practices and parental age, "children from families in which both partners identified themselves as gay or lesbian fared significantly better across a range of indicators," the authors write. They found that a child in a family where every member identified as gay or lesbian had a higher chance of graduating from college than a girl from a straight-parent family. A child in the best-case scenario raised by a parent with one parent gay or lesbian had a 44 percent higher chance of becoming an educated adult than a child from a straight-parent family with only one parent gay or lesbian.The main reason for these associations may be that gay parents seem to do a better job of building strong attachments with both their own children and with others around them.The authors note that the children of gay families—if they are raised in these families—have more "friendships, positive perceptions of their parents, and more positive attitudes about people in general, including parents and peers. They also have stronger close and extended relationships with their peers and have more confidence in the importance of peer relationships."They add, "These associations are consistent for children from families in which two parents identify as gay or lesbian, as well as in the absence of gay parents. Moreover, the stronger the parental relationships in these families, the higher the child's chances for strong, stable, and supportive peer relationships."What this finding suggests is that when children are raised in families that are open about their sexual orientation, then there's much higher likelihood that they have a supportive family environment, including family relationships that are friendly around all the members and that provide the chance to explore their sexual identity. One study of LGBT youth and families called "Coming Out in the Family" found that parents are more supportive of their children's sexual nonconformity in the family if they are open about it.Children who are not gay or lesbian, but who live with same-sex parents do better, but the benefits may vary. One study looked at a cohort of gay and lesbian kids in six different urban areas in the United States. It found that kids raised in same-sex households had a significantly lower probability of completing high school and were less likely to have a stable job than kids raised without two parents. In short, those in gay families grew up in a family where family relationships were different and therefore had less support for their sexual nonconformity and sexuality.If these children do become adults, they might face challenges. "Adults with same-sex parents may find it particularly difficult to form and maintain stable personal and professional relationships, or to get their families to respect their same-sex family relationships," the authors found.The authors suggest this may be particularly true for gay and lesbian adults because a "vulnerability" may be present in families that accept same-sex relationships but "foster family systems that are unequal in terms of power and access." A family made up of one heterosexual parent, a gay male parent and an opposite-sex parent are all more likely to have inequality in their power dynamics, which would make them less likely to be supportive of the adult child in question.There's also reason to be optimistic about the prospects for same-sex families in some of the states legalizing gay marriage, such as Maine. Marriage equality is not the same thing as "same
There's an old joke in my head, and it goes like this:"Bob's my brother Bill, but Bill's my father".Of course, I know this story is about three different brothers: Bob, Bill, and my grandfather. However, it's been my experience as both parent and child to think and talk about "brother/sister" interchangeably: "Bill is my brother, and Bob is my sister", and "Bill is my brother, and Bill is my sister, but…"And it's become second nature; because our family structure has always been "bless your heart," no one ever asks us what our "siblings" name is.But now that I'm a mother myself, with the added complication of being a child, I can think for a minute about how difficult it is to be a woman raised to think in those terms. My daughter often asks me about being a daughter of both her parents. I'd also hoped this post might be helpful to those who are wondering why she and I do what we do, as I'll show you today, but it's more of a reminder – for me – for the times I wish I did know exactly.1. It's okay – sometimes, you're just the baby sisterOne of the most interesting – and sometimes exasperating – discussions I have with my daughter has to do with my role as a mother, and her being raised to see herself in that context.I'll often begin such discussions by asking, "How is it that [child] feels you are her 'real' parent?" I don't tell her right away that she just may be. It makes things easier. It's important for her to feel that her mother would love her just the way she is.I'd think back to when I was about her age, in college. I didn't know exactly what fatherhood was, and the conversation was usually between me and my friend, who had a baby girl of her own. After a short time with my friend's child, I told my daughter she was my sister because even at that young age, I already felt like her sister.I'm sure you can relate to me.If I had been taught about motherhood at a much younger age, I think I would have assumed that I was her mother. To me, my daughter was the only child she would ever be, and I wanted to keep the lines as short as possible. I'd love for her to be the only child that I have ever known.Now that I have a daughter and know better, I also realize she is the only daughter I will ever know, because there are people that can't have children. It's okay for that to impact my experience. As such, the roles we play are so different that I think it's important to remember that in our younger days, there was so little to go on.2. It's okay to call people like meWhen talking to my daughter about her brother or sister, I can't help but refer to Bill, Bob, and Becky as my sisters – but that's not a bad thing, I assure you. Some times, you just have to start by using a name you know, and that the person you're talking to can understand and remember.When we've gone on a road trip and I'm sharing a room with Becky, I might tell her I'm her "sister Becky" – and now for the most part, she always forgets that I referred to my brother Bill as her brother. I say it often enough now that I don't notice when it happens, but still.And to be clear, Becky doesn't call me sister on a regular basis. It's just a word, and that's okay.3. It's okay to use "my sister" when referring to your motherThe first time I had spoken to my daughter about the difference between my dad and mother, I used the word, "Mommy," to describe my dad. This was because, up until then, I'd always heard me referred to as my sister, when calling her mother.When Becky called me, "Mommy Baby Girl," I was excited from the start: this was new. I'd never actually been told she was Mommy, so I was happy. To the best of my knowledge, though, my mother had never talked to me in that way.The same with my son – until recently, I'd believed his father was "Momma" to him. Now he realizes that he has not actually had words to describe my mother at all – at all. To me, his father is just a name.4. You're never too old or too young to be a "sister"I was recently doing some re-calculations on my income tax return when I told a tax attorney friend
Rangers vs Montreal Canadiens – 7:30 am, Bell CentreThe Rangers have won four straight overall, including a 6-1 rout of the Canadiens last Saturday. This will be the third meeting between these teams this season, with all three games being decided in the final 10 minutes. The Rangers are 4-0-0 against the Habs over the last five years, with the last meeting being in January of this year. On home ice, this will be the first meeting between the Habs and the Blue & Gold.In GoalHenrik Lundqvist – GAA 3.20 SV% .922Scott Darling – GAA 3.00 SV% .928InjuriesDerek Stepan – D out for at least a monthRaphael Diaz – D out indefinitely (knee)Rookie Thomas Greiss starts in goal for the Habs. Greiss has been impressive so far, with a GAA of 1.67 and SV% of .926.The MatchupsMontreal CanadiensThe Montreal Canadiens are playing their third game this season on home ice, with their first two being at the Bell Centre against the Islanders (2-1 loss).In Their Home Opener (4-1 loss), the Canadiens gave up five goals before losing 6-3. Carey Price made 34 saves, but a couple of his saves weren't good enough for him: the goal by Daniel Paille was offsides, and the goal by Alexander Radulov set up by the Islanders by Paille on a power play was just over Carey Price in the crease. Peal was on the ice for both, so maybe we shouldn't be too harsh on him.The Habs need to play a stronger first period and play the way they did in their previous two games, and that starts with Carey Price. Carey may be their best player, and is the reason their power play is firing on all cylinders. The Habs were 1/3 over the first period last time, and while no one is going to say they can't win a game on any given night, the Habs have been in complete disarray on the power play since January 4th. The Canadiens are getting goals, but not often.The Canadiens will be shorthanded tonight on the man advantage, as Andrei Markov and Douglas Murray will be on the ice.The Habs have been outshot in back-to-back games, but a lot of that is due to Montreal being outshot in their first three games after winning three in a row. They still have the second best power play in the league, thanks to scoring goals from Brian Flynn and David Desharnais, and now Brian Gionta is back too. It's easy to say that the Canadiens need to score against the Rangers, but as long as Henrik Lundqvist is between the pipes, the Habs are going to score.RangersThe Rangers did score a shootout goal against the Islanders, and they'll have a chance to do it again against the Montreal Canadiens in the shootout.The Rangers are 2-1-0 against the Canadiens this season. The second time they met at the Bell Centre, the Habs shut out the Rangers in regulation and the Habs won the shootout. The Rangers got goals from Dan Girardi, Derek Stepan, and Mats Zuccarello.Alexi Ponikarovsky put five shots on net in the 3-2 win, while Ryan McDonagh and Rick Nash each chipped in a goal and an assist. Ryan McDonagh's goal was a backhand snipe from the left spot, while Rick Nash's goal was a backhand snipe from center ice. The two players, though, had a hand in all five of the Rangers' goals.The Rangers got another huge performance from Dan Boyle. He scored two goals, and had three points. The Rangers are still in this game, and could get a big performance from Dan Boyle tonight.The Rangers still need to score to make a statement against Montreal.Players to WatchAlexei Ponikarovsky – The Rangers need lots of offense from Alexei Ponikarovsky. The Russian winger didn't do much against the Islanders, as he finished with no points and an even rating. Unfortunately for him, he's going to need to score against the Canadiens in the shootout.Bryan Bickell – You heard it here first: Bryan Bickell has been great in the NHL. The winger has three goals in two games against the Canadiens, including a hat trick against the Penguins.

Ralph Wiggum, the actor most famous for his portrayal of Fred Dutton in The Simpsons, who portrayed The Governor in season 9 of South Park, and the man who played a Nazi in the first season of Fade In, among other roles, died Tuesday morning (June 16) in Nashville at age 73.He died on a flight from Atlanta, Georgia where he was performing in a fundraiser for the Tennessee State Theatre. From the Tennessean, a source close to the family says, "His wife took care of him, but he had difficulty breathing on his own due to pneumonia."Wiggum's final film will be an HBO mini-series about his career called The Ralph Wiggum Biography (the trailer can be found below). HBO also did a movie trailer in his honor, so it's pretty amazing. The biopic will be produced by Michael Eisner and Jerry Bruckheimer.(Warning: It's pretty messed up to have a bunch of Nazi soldiers as extras on a video game.)Wiggum was the first major Hollywood black actor. After he got an agent and began acting, he won an Emmy for his role as a police dispatcher on a 1967 episode of I.Q.. From then on, he was constantly nominated for Emmy awards, and earned his first nomination in the Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series for that 1968 episode. His most famous role came for an episode of The Simpsons where he played the "Frog" character on the TV show.His other acting roles include: Dr. George Littell on The Munsters; a police officer in the 1973 police drama In Plain Sight; the German officer on the 1978 series, Die Hard; and one of the four boys who play characters on the sitcom Weeds.(Thanks to Bored Panda for sharing this clip.)
BEST ANSWER:Good idea. I have no problems at high altitude, but when you take your gloves off that pressure will just get into your skin and it stays for a long time. I would get more air circulation for more effective perspiration, but for people with latex/nylon gloves there's still a lot of perspiration on the hands as they do pull the glove off. There might be a way to get rid of this by putting a big piece of cloth around your wrists so that the pressure stays on your arm, but I haven't really thought about that.
"You are nothing but a human being with the capacity to harm others," a man was reported saying to a woman near St. Paul's Cathedral before her alleged attacker opened fire.Witnesses said the incident began outside of the restaurant and moved to a parking lot in the 1600 block of Hibert Street near University Avenue. Several shots were fired then the suspect ran east along University Avenue, according to a law enforcement source.The woman was grazed by a bullet but the man was taken into custody and is currently in stable condition at Regions Hospital, officials said.One witness, who wished to remain anonymous, told ABC News affiliate WCCO, the suspect had asked a woman to "turn off all of her lights for him" and said "you are nothing but a human being with the capacity to harm others" before he opened fire with a shotgun.The woman and the man were not physically threatened during the attack, according to the witness.Police are asking anyone with information regarding this case to call them at (612) 675-4431.
The Canadian PressTORONTO -- A federal government report recommending more than a million of the nation's children be vaccinated against five preventable diseases -- measles, whooping cough, mumps, rubella and diphtheria -- has sparked a political firestorm in Ontario.The federal vaccine advisory committee recommended children receive the injections from birth or 12 months.The decision led to an online petition calling for the suspension of the vaccine program -- which Ontario was scheduled to implement last week -- and a protest march that drew about 200 people.The recommendation was prompted after a 2012 outbreak in the U.S. of measles that sickened nearly 200 people, killing at least four and leading to hundreds of additional cases.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention called it a "public health emergency" and began urging parents and physicians to vaccinate those likely to have the measles, mumps, rubella and rubella viruses.Ontario's Public Health Act also mandated that the province's Immunization Schedule be overhauled to include those who are immune to five diseases, including the MMR vaccine, which was considered ineffective before vaccination.Federal and provincial health officials say there's a risk of autism following vaccination and have noted a link between autism and some vaccines.The panel recommended a vaccination for all three diseases for children between two months and eight years old who may not have been immunized.The report has been condemned by critics as reckless and a potential boon for anti-vaccination advocates who argue the government should be spending public money on vaccine investigations rather than on research into a suspected link between vaccines and autism."The recommendations put public health at risk," Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty said Tuesday in Quebec City, where he's attending an international summit to combat climate change.The proposed changes to Ontario's immunization regimen "were based on a lack of evidence. It's not an acceptable way to proceed on evidence-based issues," he said.The Conservatives pounced Tuesday, attacking the Liberals and the government's decision-making process."Ontario's taxpayers need to know why this recommendations were ignored, and where we go from here," said Tory leader Tim Hudak, calling the Liberal plan reckless."Instead of working to strengthen immunization programs and strengthen protections from serious diseases that affect so many children in Ontario, the Liberals are focused on creating more myths and hysteria about vaccine safety."Health Minister Deb Matthews, who was slated to announce the program to begin this week, did not respond to an interview request Tuesday.The federal government says more than 97 per cent of immunized Canadians are protected against the five diseases it recommends, and that it believes "vaccination can save lives."The panel recommends parents get their children vaccinated for measles, mumps, rubella and rubella within days, weeks or months of a positive test for measles and five days after a positive test for mumps.It suggests a vaccination between the ages of two days to four months after a positive result for measles or a fever of more than 101.5 C, as long as the vaccination is complete by birth.If a child is immunized earlier, the panel says it could be as early as two weeks after a positive test for the measles and five days after a positive test for mumps.The committee noted that, if a child is in the hospital, a second booster is required after the first vaccine.The committee recommends vaccination for at least two doses of a measles, mumps, rubella and rubella vaccine, or if a child doesn't have proof of vaccination within 15 days.The committee said all three vaccines must be administered at the same day as the first dose. It recommends three doses of the MMR vaccine, or one dose before the first shot and two after.Only the MMR vaccine has been considered as "effective and acceptable" by the American Medical Association, which said in its review it should be used during children aged one to four years and at ages two years or older.With files from the Canadian Press
[A]ny suggestion of this kind should not be viewed simply as a harmless diversion from more important goals. Indeed, the more important goal, which the Congress and the Executive should promote, is freedom of opinion and freedom of religion in our country. Our constitutional system depends on the people being able to take such risks in order to express their views as they see fit and to worship the God they please. The Government, moreover, is constitutionally committed to safeguarding and maintaining the rights of free speech, free press, and free religious exercise, and to ensuring that the individual has complete protection against such intrusions. As a result, the Government has an equal responsibility to encourage and to regulate free speech and free press, to prohibit discrimination in both public and private matters, and to protect the right of conscience.As it is now, the statute makes no exception for a newspaper. Even if the bill were not facially impermissible, it would still appear that it would discourage the exercise of what the First Amendment is most generally understood to protect. It is true, as we have said, that in many instances the press may engage in activities that are protected by the Government, such as publication of government decisions in court or in the public interest. We should not, however, conclude that the Government, because it has authority to do so, should in all cases assume the control of news gathering as well as dissemination. The Government also has the power to prevent any violation of the provisions upon which it relies. In most instances its authority does not extend, but may be checked by other provisions of law. We are unwilling, however, to extend that authority to the point of punishing newspapermen for an act committed by the press in reporting some matter of public interest. Freedom of speech and freedom of the press are not absolute values; neither is there a right of the people to remain ignorant of what may be of public interest. We have held, and must again hold, that to withhold this power from the Government at the exact time it is most needed would be to repudiate one of the central purposes of the First Amendment.The Committee on House Administration, acting upon a resolution introduced last January by Congressman F. S. Foner, an Illinois Democrat, concluded its report with the following statement: "This investigation is designed to assure that no reporter shall be deprived of the liberties guaranteed him by the Constitution, and that all provisions of the Internal Revenue Code may not be used to interfere with the freedom of press or to suppress the circulation of newspapers. This action was necessitated by the enactment last June of a law in Illinois, which, if it stands, threatens the complete suppression of all newspapers not wholly owned or controlled by corporations or unions, and the interference with the freedom of the press which has been shown to be one of the aims of this law. The committee finds that the law was passed after long and careful deliberation and does not have a discriminatory purpose, and that it will not tend to prevent or suppress reporting of news or public affairs, but only to bring about uniformity in the manner in which the publication thereof may be carried out. It is therefore recommended that Congress rescind the law. This recommendation has not been approved by the House Administration Committee, and is therefore awaiting confirmation by its own members."The House approved this recommendation by an overwhelming voice of 228 to 5, March 18, 1937.The Congress has failed to act on a similar resolution introduced by Congressman James E. Thurmond, South Carolina Democrat. This has been referred to the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives.
The New York Knicks signed guard Ron Baker on Friday, as the team has agreed to acquire his restricted free agency rights, according to multiple sources.The Knicks signed a deal with Utah for guard James Southerland on Thursday and have yet to sign guard Jeremy Tyler, who played last season for the Cleveland Cavaliers. Tyler, an NBA All-Rookie first team member last season, was drafted 16th overall by the Cleveland Cavaliers.The Knicks have five players on the roster now with guaranteed contracts for next season under the Anthony/Melo-era system: Anthony, J.R. Smith, Tyler, J.R. Smith and Jerian Grant.Baker, 25, averaged 13.9 points in 31 games last season. In addition to the Utah games, he played in seven games for the Sacramento Kings and six games with the Denver Nuggets.
LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - More than 50 countries have promised financial support if Syria gives up its chemical weapons, international aid agencies said on Tuesday, as the country held a major peace conference.Syrian President Bashar al-Assad stands with Iran's President Hassan Rouhani during their meeting in Damascus January 6, 2013. REUTERS/StringerIn the first major international attempt to pressure the Assad government, 55 countries, including several European Union members, agreed to give Syria the money, the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said."It's an important milestone in the international community's fight to contain and rid Syria of chemical weapons and it's a demonstration of the international community's support," said Mark Lyall Grant, a spokesman for the U.N.'s World Food Programme (WFP).The deal is intended to provide help over a five-year period and covers the country's chemical weapons program, which the United Nations says has turned into one of the gravest threats to world peace in three years.Since then, the government, allied to its ally Iran, has seized a series of chemical weapons facilities and declared them secure.Yet the World Health Organization has said thousands of people may have been killed or injured in suspected chemical weapon attacks since the conflict began in 2011. U.S. President Barack Obama says the Syrian army "gained access to chemical weapons during the course of the conflict".There was uncertainty last week over whether the Syrian government would sign the chemical weapons deal, but Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said Damascus was willing to make "all necessary steps" to reach the goal of destroying all chemical weapons.The U.N. conference, called for by Western powers, calls for an emergency U.N. Security Council meeting to approve a package of measures and a ceasefire to begin immediately. It is scheduled to last three weeks.U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said they expected support for the diplomatic process in coming weeks and pledged to continue their work towards a diplomatic resolution to Syria's conflict which has dragged on for nearly four years."The Russian and American negotiators will work and work and work and continue to move towards a positive outcome," said Lavrov.France said on Monday it would propose drafting a resolution by the end of the week, which could then come to the U.N. Security Council for approval at its first meeting in over a year later this month.Lebanon on Tuesday rejected calls from Arab states and the Islamic World for a military strike against Syria to help end a three-year-old conflict in which at least 100,000 people have been killed, many of them civilians, according to U.N. estimates.

The best way to make sure we're all paying attention to the most important news out of Washington is to spend more time than usual, and with more reporters, in the halls of Congress. From the Hill:This week's top 5 stories:5.) Federal government shut down over budget debateWhile all eyes are on the Senate, we're tracking the standoff in the House:House GOP to hold debt ceiling vote in two weeks, then consider "Plan B"5) Senate leaders' latest round of talks falls short, but will keep it from shutting down againWith all of the pressure building on Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid to accept Boehner's offer to reopen the government and raise the debt limit — he refused to do it yesterday and will reject it today — Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) came to the floor yesterday and made the following statement:"My friends, the American people will not stand for this. ... But I also intend to stand with the American people, and with the American people can't stand more of that. So I'm going to vote against a government spending bill that keeps the government open if Speaker Boehner brings it up."That's the most I can remember the man ever making a statement that might actually get him thrown out of the chamber.6) House to consider House GOP bill on Obama's executive actionsLast night, House Republicans passed a proposal to halt implementation of President Obama's executive actions on immigration and gun control in exchange for a government funding bill that includes language blocking money for this type of executive action. And we thought it was bad. But this afternoon, Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) took it one step further, announcing that the full House will vote to override President Obama's veto if the House passes legislation to halt the funding of illegal aliens."If we are asked to approve funding for executive amnesty, then House Republicans will put it to a vote," Kinzinger said on Laura Ingraham's radio show. "It would not require a supermajority of votes so, my prediction is that President Obama will veto this legislation, and there'll be a very, very brief window in which he could make a veto. The moment will come, and we would vote on that and hopefully we'll come to a conclusion during the session."You see? We've seen enough to know that if Kinzinger wants a law that would permanently halt funding for this president's actions, he has to put it up for a vote, so we're going to ask him to come back.The Senate is expected to take up the immigration bill tomorrow, and it will be voted on in the same manner as the House GOP measure. The only difference is that Democrats have insisted — by threatening government shutdown — that it pass first. Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) is insisting that Democrats will go along, though, and keep it moving: "I do believe the Democrats are going to take a position on this issue, that they're going to vote to reopen the government," Durbin said. "A government shutdown is not good for anybody, and it's not good for people in the D.C. area, it's not good for folks in Missouri, Illinois, Minnesota — you name it."In other words, there's a real possibility that this whole government shutdown and debt limit fight will wind up being fought on the Senate floor, something that Durbin doesn't think will be very positive for people in the D.C. area.7) House Dems are considering new ways to block Trump tax hikesThis isn't a big deal — Senate Finance Chairman Max Baucus (D-Mont.) has already endorsed Democrats' position that taxes must be increased to fund any federal shutdown. Baucus is also one of two senators who had already said he would oppose such a shutdown.But it's important to note that House Democrats are considering their own plan to block such shutdowns — though they have ruled out using a government shutdown to defund Obamacare, and are only discussing using a vote to defund the spending bill that the House and Senate are working on now to make sure federal agencies don't run out of money.The House Democratic Caucus is discussing a number of proposals. One of them has Democrats voting to use a vote to defund Obamacare to put a hold on passage of the continuing resolution. Then if the Senate and House couldn't overcome the hold on funding, the Senate would vote to undo the hold.Another measure would prohibit any votes to fund the government by using the funding bill to defund the Affordable Care Act or to make changes to the health care law.As Politico explains:"We can't vote this week for CRs that would take care of the health care part of it" if that amendment is not added, said a top House Democratic leadership aide. "We believe this language is un-necessary
Kendrick Lamar is a major voice in Hip Hop—and now, we have some new images from his new album to prove it. Lamar made their way through the streets of New York City, and while we're a week away from the release of To Pimp A Butterfly, the visuals are incredible.The latest collection of photos are of him with his mother and grandmother, and they show the young rapper working in various projects throughout New York. Kendrick's mother, Afeni, tells the story of what it was like to move to the states with her first son, and she was able to stay close to Lamar throughout much of his childhood. She has said that he was extremely respectful of her, and now, they can really see the change in him over the years.Lamar is set to drop his latest album in less than two weeks, and his fans got a taste of some of the art during his performance earlier this month for TDE's "Backseat Freestyle" in front of 50 Cent at the MTV VMA's. The new images seem to confirm that it is a concept album, and there are also some images of him on the street.Advertisement"This project is called To Pimp A Butterfly," the artist says in one of the posters. "And I'm back. I'm gonna make my ass go hard, this time they gon' be ready."
Carmelo Anthony was a spectator last week during the Knicks' practice, but he had the last laugh with an extra practice Friday.Anthony and co. took an 18-3 record as a surprise this season into overtime and the first round loss in the East on Friday night against the Atlanta Hawks.Not only did they beat the Hawks, but they also were a surprise in the loss column.The Knicks (38-36) had been 7-0 to start the season, but had three losses by a total of four points in the last four and were now 0-1 in a first-round match-up for the first time since 2005, when the franchise went 1-9."It was all luck," Knicks coach Mike Woodson said. "Any team you can put into this situation, it is a little different. The fact that we got the victory was the thing. The teams that have been in this position before -- like a lot of those teams that have had struggles and have had to overcome injuries -- we are very fortunate that we were in this situation."Anthony got a big assist on the game-winning shot from point guard Raymond Felton. Anthony took a pass off the dribble and passed to Felton for a wide-open 3-pointer at the top of the arc.The Knicks have never had a winning record when they play a game away from the Wells Fargo Center, but Carmelo Anthony had a big game Friday night. AP Photo/Brett CarlsenWith the Knicks trailing 103-100 with 26 seconds left in regulation, the Hawks cut the lead to 105-104 with a 3-pointer by Josh Smith. Atlanta's Al Horford then drove the length of the court for a layup.A.J. Price was called for interference when he came around from between Felton and Smith and hit Smith above the free throw line with two seconds left.The Knicks had one more chance with 10.6 seconds left and their defense prevented Atlanta from pulling off the unthinkable."We're not down," Anthony said. "We're just going to keep going. We'll keep fighting."The Nets' Al Harrington -- who joined the Knicks two days after coach Jason Kidd was fired -- led the Hawks with 30 points and seven assists with four turnovers.The only player for the Hawks who played was rookie Kyle Korver -- who went scoreless on 1-for-7 shooting at Toronto -- and he went 3-for-4 on 3-pointers.The Hawks -- coming off a 96-83 win in Toronto on Wednesday to improve to a 13-0 record -- came in averaging 107.8 points on 46.7 percent shooting.Anthony went 4-for-16 on 3-pointers Friday -- including 1-for-9 from deep -- before scoring 30 in the second half off the bench. That was a season-high in points. Anthony went 9-for-18 on 3-pointers in a 106-93 rout of the Miami Heat in late February.Anthony made his first five shots, including three 3s, as he hit five 3s in the first half with his team trailing by only one. He was 2-for-5 in the fourth quarter after a 2-for-11 shooting night in the first."It's a little different because you're playing to get a W, but obviously a win and a loss is going to carry you a long way," Anthony said. "You've got to get your guys excited."The Knicks play host to the Philadelphia 76ers on Saturday night. They have already clinched a playoff spot. Anthony has not played since Dec. 3. He is still dealing with a right ankle sprain.Anthony started all but one game last season while averaging a career-high 28.0 points, but his shooting percentage tailed off from 39.5 last season to 32.6 this season. Woodson believes it will come back as the New York offense gets more comfortable with his style."He's a very talented player and when he's healthy, he's going to be one of the best point guards to ever play," Woodson said. "He's got a good feel for the game, he loves to get out of his comfort zone. He's a guy that has proven himself at the highest level at the highest level of basketball. The best part about the game is that there is no better game than when you play well, even if there is no good team to beat."All that matters is that the game is good. He's a great player and so is he going to get to play great against New York, as well? And do we have him on a good team going to play well?"TIP-INSBucks: Center Larry Sanders has missed 15 of 16 games with a strained right calf. He was averaging 11.8 points
New York is currently in the grip of a heat wave.The last seven days have had some of the highest June temperatures in modern history, but that's not the only trend in the city. While temperatures dropped off this past week, they are still about three to five degrees above the century-long average, and about a degree higher than they were the last time the city was on summertime alert (in 2004). This means the city is on track to set a record daily high temperature for June 14, but not just on that day. The record for the highest daily high, set last Friday, will likely also fall on that day or the next.That's because the record daily high—set last Friday—also ties the previous record low for June in New York. "The last time all 7 days were cooler-than-average was in 2004 when all 7 days were warmer than average," says Paul Pastelok at WeatherBell Analytics. The warmest temperatures in the city have been achieved in the last month. On May 5 it was 90 degrees, on May 14 it is 99 degrees.So is a record month likely?"I would not be surprised if it's not a record month for June, but it's not too far-fetched either," Pastelok says. The record for the hottest month for June, set back in 2005, also came when all seven days were cooler than average at 90 degrees.
[A/N: Some of you are probably thinking, "Oh, this is why they need to change names so often—I have to search every single place to be sure to mention the right chapter!" And you're right. I am, but I think it's a pretty nice name for this one. (If you aren't familiar with the novel, you can read "Pairing" for an introduction.) I've gone ahead and given it a little teaser for the readers. If you're on Tumblr—which, by the way, if you don't know, is fantastic for a story—you should be able to read the chapter immediately.If this is something that interests you then you should check out "The Night That Remains in Spring." It's a wonderful short, and I highly recommend it, but with more than one pairing.This chapter has really come to me. My first day of writing is this Wednesday. I'll likely be a little inconsistent with my posting schedule, but will still try to post every few days. Feel free to join me. I can't promise to update as often this week as I have for some of my older work (I think I'm going with the "always be on" thing).-Erika M.Chapter 1Homeworld, the world where every day is the same, where everything is exactly the same. There are no true holidays, no traditions, only the constant rush of work and home-life.At times, it can seem like a paradise.Samantha Greenstreet, nineteen years old, was always at work by eight sharp. She got up early, was put to bed late, and was on her way out the door by nine. By ten, she got back home, sat down at the kitchen table in her apartment to start her day, and her body temperature never left normal range. So it was no surprise when at noon her cell phone rang."Samantha?""Hallelujah, Daddy."Her father was in trouble.She had just finished a shift as an assembly line worker in a major American city. She'd been a bit underprepared, and after the accident in the plant, the city was trying to hold her from getting a decent rate for her time on the assembly line. Now, she could only find temporary assembly line work, and for that she had to wait.After her shift at the plant, she'd spent her time going to the store, then watching her father working at the assembly line. Even though her shift was ending, she had to admit she'd rather watch him. And what she was most fascinated by was that when she saw him at work, he had his face covered. She'd realized then that everyone in that town was like that. People had their faces covered, but they couldn't help but feel like a public spectacle.At least it would be if the authorities didn't come knocking.Her father told her to get ready, that he'd make it to lunch, and the family went out for dinner. He left her with her cousin for a little while, then came back. He called her name.She nodded, turned off her phone, tucked it in her pocket, and walked out the front door, only to find her cousin on the sidewalk a few blocks away."Samantha?""Daddy." She held her hand up, trying not to cry.He didn't know who she was or what she had been up to on her day off, but he recognized her voice and his face turned red with embarrassment. He was going to apologize right there in front of her, and it was going to sting.Samuel Greenstreet didn't realize the depth of her emotions.She took his arm and lead him on another ten blocks to a corner cafe. There, after another couple of minutes of awkward silence, she explained to him what had happened so that he could help her and that they could come home. While they were talking he began taking her out by the hand to the shops and eating in private, and she was happy to accept this."There are people who will never forgive you for your accident. But you need the money. Your father needs this money, and so do your mother and your younger sister, who I think will be too afraid to look at your face anymore. Even your little brother just won't speak to you without you covering your own face, or if he's not too drunk."He was embarrassed."But I know that it's just a scratch. We can get it cleaned up and it's perfectly fine."Her dad frowned, but accepted her help anyway. And when they came back to his apartment, he asked her if she'd ever been on break and she told him yes the day before. He didn't know if this
CALGARY – A Calgary woman who died after a fire at her west-end apartment Sunday night has been identified.Ashley Lai, 31, was from Taiwan and had been living in Calgary for about six months. The fire started around 8:30 p.m. in a basement suite of the apartment building where she lived.Witnesses told Global News the man who lived in the apartment suite had been on his laptop when smoke started to fill the room. A woman found Lai and began screaming for help.Lai died on scene in a unit that was full of smoke."To see that happen and realize a life went out with it was heartbreaking," Lai's fiancee Lai Chi said Tuesday. "Ashley was beautiful. She was so joyful and full of life."The woman in the same apartment was airlifted to the Foothills Hospital where her condition is currently unknown.READ MORE: Toronto woman, 35, dies after fall from roof: CFSThe building had numerous fire alarms but they were not working and it appears to be a coincidence no one in the apartment was home at the time of the fire."That whole building, the building was full of smoke," fire fighter Brian Pirt said. "There were four fire alarms going off, I can't tell you how many, two were in the basement."It will be impossible for investigators to determine what caused the building to quickly go up in flames, he said."There will be nothing to connect it as to the fire being caused intentionally. It will just be the initial fire," Pirt said.Pirt called the fire tragic but the fact that there were fire alarms in the building in the first place is something he will forever remember."For someone to be so fortunate to be able to save somebody is very tragic," he said.When the fire broke out, Pirt raced to the scene and helped extinguish the flames."The worst thing you can say is it's very scary but you never want to see that but you can't prevent it, you can't stop it," he said. "As I got here on fire it did look as though we got through."It takes a lot of bravery, it takes a lot of luck."Lai's relatives said they were not sure when the couple met. They were staying in an apartment in another city and planned to get married and start a family there."Her heart was so big," said Lai's uncle Yang Min.Friends of Lai said they are surprised and shocked by what happened."It's very sad and it's very sudden and we are very glad we've got this far because her situation would have been very grim," said Lai's friend Li Ming."We don't know how her heart was so strong, we don't know what she would do if nothing happened here. We hope for the best."READ MORE: Edmonton man dies after being pinned between truck and tree in storm drain: RCMPWith files from The Canadian Press
We've got a huge batch of news from today's Game of Thrones Season 5 Finale – you can catch up on our coverage right here. And we also have two special Game of Thrones Season 5 episodes: one for HBO GO and one for fans on HBO NOW.First, go catch up on yesterday's news by reading our recap here and the latest news here. And now, here are all the new details:What Happened to Brienne?You might have noticed that some people around the internet, and in Westeros, weren't happy: HBO has now announced the end of Brienne's quest on her own, and there's no sign of her and the Hound returning to King's Landing any time soon.Brienne and Pod still travel together though on a different mission, as he's currently going undercover in the Citadel itself to see what goes on in one of these enigmatic places. And while the Hound and Brienne are on the move, another woman from the fighting pits continues her relentless assault on Sansa Stark – Lady Stoneheart. So what's going on with the Mad Lady?Speaking of Mad Lady, I've got confirmation in this photo that Melisandre will be back later. But Melisandre and Davos' visit to the Red Keep at the end of last week's episode was not what you might expect when you think of a scene set there. As this photo points of, there were no guards or other personnel present at all. Melisandre was free to do what she wished. It wasn't something of the sort when she tried to open the door when she and Davos first arrived.This is all an interesting development – what else might Davos learn from one of the most powerful women of Westeros? Is Melisandre just another "wild woman" who does her own thing – another way to kill people? Or is she actually something different than that…?Melisandre is still madly in love with Jon Snow, but Davos will have more to say on this front after the end of season 5:"Her passion had to die," says actor John Bradley. "It's a good thing for her that she's going to meet him in the afterlife – but she'll have to learn something about the other man that she hasn't learned yet."BONUS: Here's the latest Game of Thrones trailer below and the episode's synopsis:Game of Thrones Season 5 – Part 1 (New #)A man has arrived in Riverrun with word that his beloved sister Lyanna Stark has been found. Now Robb must journey to the North, where his uncle Benjen will try to save his life. Theon Greyjoy has gone north to find a ship to flee Winterfell. While the Lannisters hunt down the remnants of his host, Sansa Stark remains hidden away in Winterfell. Daenerys and Brienne have an urgent mission to deliver to King's Landing and Robb is going to a castle to save his life once again.(Full spoilers for episode 6 here)Episode 6The Hound has the honor of coming with Robb at Castle Ashford, where it's supposed to be a celebration. While they're there, Robb has a secret surprise that will blow the whole thing wide open – his son Lyanna will be reunited with her family. Robb has some very conflicted feelings about it, but it's the only way to make things right, whatever it takes.In the meantime, Sansa has no choice though: The Iron Throne is her next target. She'll have to break up her own wedding with Eddard and start a real one with Jon Snow. So what's going on with her father's brother Theon going through with the wedding he had planned? It seems that he's gotten a lot of training in how to be a prince. And after Arya Stark and Sansa Stark start dating, we'll know if he's finally learned how to act like one.And the Mad King is also back in Dorne – and now he's got the entire country after him. Joffrey is the King, and he's got one foot in King's Landing right now, but his wife Margaryan has decided to stand by him while the rest of the court looks elsewhere. Margaryan has an important message for Joffrey to hear: she wants him to return her home and take back her father's seat. Is her letter a threat to Joffrey's reign or does she know that her message is really a good one?And just when you're thinking that Joffrey has made many enemies here in the Seven Kingdoms, the Red Viper has a new one… in a rather unexpected way…The Mad King and the Mad King's SonSansa is definitely trying to stay quiet here, but she's really trying to find out what's really going on between Daenerys

A man convicted of manslaughter for allowing his two year old daughter to get a chilli pepper into her eye has lost the appeal to the Court of Appeal (Coo).Eddie Aamer, 40, originally of the US state of Florida, moved to the UK in late 2001 when he was detained for five months in the US on suspicion of terrorism. Before the incident, he had a conviction for molesting his three year old daughter. The original charge was reduced to manslaughter after his initial guilty plea but was then re-opened on an appeal to the high court.Eddie, then aged eight and a half, was sleeping at one house when Edith, who was 11 years old at the time, suddenly got a chilli into one eye. Her mother told the court that her eyes hurt for two months and Eddie was found guilty of her manslaughter.The case was heard by a judge at London's Woolwich crown court but was dismissed because it was believed he never had the chance to give a full oral hearing to Eddie, who was in custody. Edith's mother had only seen a small part of the trial. She was asked by a judge to show a child psychiatrist how she was "scared by things like children being killed and eaten" although the psychiatrist could not make a mental assessment for Edith.Eddie, who was later released on bail following the incident, is seeking permission to bring Edith to live permanently with him in the UK. However, the appeal court ruling has led him to consider returning to the US.He told BBC News: "A couple of months later I got into a row and said if I can't be friends with girls I won't be able to be friends with girls in the future. And I think as soon as I said it my eyes went blank; the colour came out of them."It was something that really did affect my whole life. I don't know how you could do that to somebody you care about. It's something that you just can't explain unless there's an event."My eyesight is now much better, but when I was 12 I lost my glasses. That made me realize it was more than just an eye condition. That really affected my whole confidence and self-esteem," he added.He added that he had already completed the process of applying for legal asylum once he completed his sentence from the district court."There's nothing I can do to make the United Kingdom my home and I don't want to settle down anywhere just to have my daughter," Eddie claimed. Although he is allowed to have a "consent order", he has asked the court to make a decision on his application so that it can come before the Home Secretary, Theresa May.
If the game of hockey is to be anything, it's for real. That's why you'll find players — even in the NHL, for instance — being paid to play hockey.As the salary cap remains in its early days but there appears to be some movement to open the door for more money to be spread around, the NHLPA will take an active role in this effort.The new CBA between the league and NHLPA was signed on Sept. 1 and the two sides were due to have a 90-day negotiating period between Sept. 18 and Oct. 4 in which they will try to hammer out a new contract.So far, only the salary cap seems near an agreement. That seems set at $69 million or so for 2016-17. The NHLPA has been pushing for more money going into player development programs.In 2015-16, the NHL spent just shy of $10 million — some of it earmarked for the Players' Emergency Assistance Fund. That money would become available under the CBA.The cap hit for the upcoming season is just under a $6.3 million cap, with that figure likely to increase to about $6.5 million. If the cap stays about the same, it would drop to a $1.67 million figure.In the coming weeks, the league will meet with media before its annual owners meeting in Boca Raton, Fla.
"I'm going to look for a new home," she said. "I am very stressed. I cannot take it any more if I have to live where the dogs sleep."
For a moment it was really hard not to feel like a bad person just for saying that. It was the first time she had ever really acknowledged me for being a person, just a person who's also a writer, with thoughts and feelings and feelings that also happen to be part of being a writer. She was just going out of her way to admit to who she was, and to me, a writer of many thoughts and feelings.But really, it's just not what I ever needed from my editor – because I never, ever really wanted to be a person, as people are in other parts of the world. We're all just individuals with thoughts and feelings and feelings. But, well, that's just how we are. I'm very much the opposite of I Am a Person – I don't think I ever have. Which is fine… I am a writer, who likes to write in a very different way from other people. But I think if you want to be a person, then we're all more or less all at least a bit the same thing. So, I think that's how I've been able to write in a way I can be truly proud of.In this new book, you explore that very subject – identity – for a lot of people who aren't people at all. Is it a journey you've been on before, through other worlds?I think I knew it would happen sooner or later, and I wanted to write about it. This novel is part of a lot of things that I've been thinking about for a long time – like, the way I was raised, things I've written, and the way I've tried to write. So, when I started thinking about my own life story, my own family situation, and what identity is, that's where the idea first sprung from. And then I went back and studied everything I've written before, and I saw how many similarities there were there. I just felt the urge. But for me, that was an important piece.What I didn't want to do is pretend the person I was then wasn't me then, or pretend that the person I was then was the same person who's reading this book. It was important to just go back and see why it was a good idea. The point is to let the person who hasn't read it know that this person exists, and I hope that makes a little bit of sense.The book is often about people who can never seem to escape their past, who have lived in the shadows of their past as people who were once very different from those around them, but who now try to maintain the fiction of their lives as long as possible. Why do you think you wrote that way?It's all about the difference between reality in the real world and fiction in the story. For me, people who are not real, people whose minds are just made up, are the most interesting subjects. The idea that we can live so long, and live in a world that is so much stranger and more dangerous and more complex than our own, and we never really understand it. We just think of ourselves as more and more isolated from each other, from the real world.But I think real human beings, we have different minds than those made up. We know something about each other, we're more intimate with each other. And I never wanted to write a book about a character who was just another character. I wanted to write a book with characters.How did the book come about, and when did you first feel like you wanted to write it?It really does come from deep in my heart and my heart is broken a lot of the time and I know I have more heartbreak in the future and maybe I just haven't realized it yet. The ideas came, and I started to write, and I wrote them on scraps of paper, on notebooks, and it was a really good exercise. Writing is one of the few things I've ever really thought of as a way to be better, because writing is exercise. The other is sketching.You've talked about wanting to make this a novel with a narrative structure, but you also seem to want to write a story with very little backstory, and have the reader not know anything about who the characters are. Are two things linked?As a writer, I've always wanted to tell stories and always wanted to make them feel special. I always think that stories just make the world richer, and I find there are just so many ways to tell stories in a narrative format that it's really about finding the right one for the story.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has announced a decision to phase in the use of a crash-avoidance camera system on all new vehicles from 2019 in a bid to cut down fatalities and injuries.The new system aims to prevent vehicles from hitting each other.It has been suggested that autonomous cars would reduce the number of traffic accidents. It can therefore save lives."The technology does make a difference," NHTSA's deputy administrator, Mark Rosekind, said in a statement."But what we cannot do is prevent every accident or every fatality, because that requires all drivers, rather than just a few, to pay attention at all times."But the proposal has raised concern to the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC), a privacy non-profit. It believes that the NHTSA decision is "dangerous and misguided"."The agency's new rules and regulations will affect all drivers equally but will do nothing to improve either the safety or efficiency of our roads," EPIC wrote.The group also called for a full review of privacy and security in this area.If the new system is implemented, vehicle manufacturers would be required to install the cameras at least as a backup to the traditional radar system that automatically senses objects in the road ahead.The NHTSA is also considering whether to make the system mandatory on all new vehicles, a move that is more likely under President Trump.The agency recently put forth a proposal in response to the increasing number of car crashes and accidents, which it attributed largely to the driving styles of young people."The rate of fatal crashes involving young people ages 18-24 increased an astonishing 932% between 2000 and 2016," the NHTSA said.The industry body ABI Automotive said it's not at all convinced about how to improve safety in the car, but believes that it'll be a tough task regardless of which technology is implemented."This is a very complex puzzle that doesn't fit into any box," ABI Automotive's marketing executive, Bill Johnson said in an interview with CNNMoney."It's a little bit like saying, 'What is the perfect house but what kind of dog gets a home?' You can't just add more perfect homes or add more dog houses."He said that the new camera technology might be a good solution to reduce injuries and deaths."But what you are going to find is that all the cars that roll out that are using this technology, it's going to slow down their performance," Johnson said.

New York City and other northern states may have escaped the worst of the record-breaking heat, but that doesn't mean it's going to be a break-free summer in some parts, even in the Northeast.The National Weather Service forecasts the next few weeks in many parts of eastern and mid-Atlantic states to be "exceptionally hot," particularly the summer months ahead, particularly in New York City and northern New Jersey.Temperatures are currently running 4-7 C above normal for this time of the year on Tuesday, with the high forecast for Wednesday in the mid-Atlantic Region of about 80 to 85 C. Wednesday is expected to be another heat wave in the region, with a high of 86 C on Thursday and 87 C on Friday.READ MORE: Heat wave expected to hit most of Canada Wednesday"It could be very hot this week," Dr. Jason Samenow, climatologist with Environment Canada told Global News Thursday morning.By weekend, the temperatures could drop dramatically – for some parts of the region as much as 1 C lower than normal.The biggest challenge will be the record-breaking heat, said Samenow.READ MORE: Summer heat forecast: Where to stay warm this summer"This type of weather pattern isn't typical," he said."It's very unusual that we'll have this type of weather pattern in a stretch like this."READ MORE: Record-breaking heat in Vancouver, the hottest in history"While we've had these hot days in the past, we haven't had this type of heat the last two weeks."On Wednesday, Environment Canada called for a 40+ per cent chance of rain over the next five days, but that will be the most significant of the three potential precipitation bands the rain may fall in: a rain/flood event, a thunderstorm event or a mixed-range event.A low pressure system in the northeastern United States has drenched the Lower 48, dumping more than 3 C of rain across the Plains and Midwest early this week, according to Environment Canada.

The world's largest bitcoin mining pool, GHash.IO, is looking for a new owner according to a recent tweet."Looking for new owner," the pool tweeted Friday.GHash.IO is currently the largest bitcoin mining pool, with 4,100 GH/s of mining power on its network. The organization has long claimed it is committed to protecting the interests of its customers' funds, and not seeking to profit from the mining operation.In February, the company reported a $12.8 million loss due to mining fees. On Thursday the company reported that its network hash rate had reached 4,100 PH/s, a record for the time frame measured.According to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Mining Price Index and BitInfoCharts, the mining group is currently priced at over $150 in both Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin, while a new owner could potentially bring GHash.IO's cost to around $40.A statement issued earlier this week by the company read, the decision to move away from mining in Bitcoin comes because "we believe that mining in general is becoming obsolete.""We are taking the necessary measures to protect our investments and our customers' funds," the company added.
Barry Carter/Getty ImagesThe San Jose Earthquakes will have to make do without the services of a number of regulars and key starters for their match this Saturday against the Kansas City Chiefs.Quakes defender Clarence Goodson has been ruled out with a sprained MCL in his left knee, according to MLSsoccer.com's Steven Goff.Goodson will not travel with the team to Kansas City.Goodson, 26, has appeared in 30 games for the Quakes thus far this season, recording 11 starts in place of the injured Steven Beitashour.Goodson will be joined on the sidelines by goalkeeper David Bingham, who has been called up by the Costa Rica National Team for World Cup qualifiers against Mexico and the Central American country's regional rival Nicaragua.While Bingham is not eligible to play for Costa Rica due to the FIFA international window closing before the tournament, he should be close enough to San Jose anyway to be eligible.Bingham has yet to appear in a game for the Quakes after being selected to the roster on November 2. Quakes coach Mark Watson said before the match with the Portland Timbers on Wednesday that he expected Bingham to be available for selection from the start, but it appears his recovery could be delayed by two weeks.Bingham will be given the opportunity to earn minutes in international competition for Costa Rica next month, when his country opens the final round of qualifying on November 15 in Honduras. Bingham would likely not get a chance to feature in that match despite his inclusion on the roster.Bingham has played primarily as an orthodox goalkeeper in MLS over the past couple of years, but has also taken part in the Under-23 National Team setup in 2013 and 2014.Bingham's inclusion on the Costa Rica roster has to be interpreted in the context of the depth of the squad currently holding down the starting job. San Jose were able to sign former MLS standout Miguel Camargo last month, but he will head to Costa Rica on a four-day trial this week.

An 18th-century shipwreck discovered by the Florida-based wreckhunter-schlepper Odyssey is "as much history as it is shipwreck," says Odyssey founder and expedition archaeologist Peter Marzilli. The ship, which sank near Cape Hatteras on Aug. 28, 1816, will be added to Odyssey's World Heritage Fleet, and Marzilli is preparing a news release to mark the occasion.Marzilli visited the wreck site along with archaeology professor Dr. David J. Williams of the University of South Carolina on Aug. 30. The ship is a frigate of the North Carolina Line. According to an Odyssey press release, Marzilli stated that "unlike many shipwrecks ... we know where they are, we're close, we can explore them, and we know their identities, but as we do so, they become more and more interesting and different."According to Williams, the frigate "was a first-class ship -- the finest merchantman of its day, with all its fittings and equipments in good order," and "a fine example of an early American ship.""The only part of her hull that we know the extent of is the mainmast, which was just the top portion of the ship," said Williams. "The rest of her is mostly in the Atlantic, but it was the best built of any ship of its time.""The wreck has more artifacts on it than any of the ships we've explored together," said Marzilli.The shipwreck was discovered in 1999 by Dutch oceanographer Jeroen Verhoeven, who was part of the Odyssey's expeditions in 2006 and 2008. An image of the wreck shows a large "S" in the middle of the ship, marking it on the mapping software called ArcMap. This is a remnant from the original hull.Marzilli says Odyssey has not yet found the original structure, though he expects it will surface sometime next year. "The hull has been damaged a lot, and you can understand why: I wouldn't expect to find a fully intact ship in the ocean. You can't just go out and go find this stuff."The wreck will serve as a "time capsule," said Marzilli. It reveals information about the ship's structure and equipment, including its coal supply and the coal storage locker. Marzilli also pointed out that the ship's keel was cut, and the wooden hulls were torn to pieces."This is a ship that you go to Atlantic to see, but it's so beautifully preserved and detailed that you can see it, and you can imagine what's behind the hull," Williams said.Marzilli hopes the ship will be exhibited in a museum in South Carolina, where it could easily be found, or he said that the museum could display it at the South Carolina Maritime Museum -- which is currently closed -- for students and historians to view. As of Aug. 29, the website for the museum says that a formal proposal has not yet been submitted.Marzilli has worked with Odyssey on many expeditions before and found more than 30 wrecks before, he noted. "We all like to search for the most significant sites," he noted. Although the most recent wreck to be discovered is in the United States, the search is just beginning. "We are going to take our time and go over every one of them," Marzilli said. "So once we bring this all to light, you will really get an idea of who these people were, what their motives were, and why they left their ships and their families out on the sea."
The FBI has "no information to back up" the president's tweet Friday morning that former President Barack Obama had my phones tapped.That's according to a statement from an FBI spokesman, Peter Carr, who also said the FBI has "no comment" on any of this and so much more."The FBI is collecting all necessary pieces of information concerning Russia's alleged interference in our presidential election and will release those findings, as we have done in the past, at the proper time, and in the manner authorized by law and appropriate by the Constitution," said Carr, speaking at the Intelligence and National Security Alliance Annual Conference.The president's tweet Friday morning took a shot at Obama for not condemning Russian President Vladimir Putin following news on Friday that U.S. spy agencies had concluded, based on wiretaps, that Moscow had interfered in the 2016 election to help Trump:Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my "wires tapped" in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017The president repeated these allegations to NBC News after a meeting with House and Senate leaders. When asked by Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) if that meant the FBI has "suspicions" that Trump's campaign or associates were colluding with the Russian government to throw the election, Trump said, "Yeah.""It could be something, but it could also be something else. I mean, it could also be somebody sitting in a bed some place. It also could be somebody sitting on their bed," the president said Thursday.When the New York Times reported this on Friday morning, Trump fired off a flurry of tweets, accusing the newspaper of using his language of wiretapping without specifics to support its reporting. "Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my 'wires tapped' in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!" Trump said.
Carmen, a young female passenger on the No.1 bus, was sitting up with the bus driver but then fell to the ground. The driver called for a paramedic, but before any could arrive at the scene, other bus passengers arrived and attacked the driver. The police found three women beaten up at the bus station, at which point some of them decided to break into the bus to return the driver the $10,000 he had allegedly stolen from them. The women were detained and the police report they were trying to blackmail the driver.This is not a very common event on Hong Kong's roads, so we thought we might help you by compiling a list of the best taxi scams that occur on a regular basis.10. Tipping Taxi DriversHong Kong is not usually referred to as a city that does not tip taxi drivers. However, there is an exception to this rule. If you decide to pay with cash, you can have the driver change it into a local currency and provide you with a receipt.This is the quickest and simplest way to show the staff at taxi drivers that you have taken out their service. However, some people will try to get a refund from the driver even if there is no receipt. If you pay with cash and the staff do get your money back, be sure to ask the driver to write down your name and your pickup and destination details so you can report the incident.9. The Stealing of Your Credit CardWe don't recommend stealing a credit card, as this is a big enough hassle in any other country. However, there is quite a few people who do this in Hong Kong, especially those who have never had a credit card before.If your credit card has been stolen, there is an immediate need for you to contact your bank as soon as you know about the theft. You should also tell your bank to alert cardholders of this scam.8. The Fake Phone CallThis is always a problem in Hong Kong. People will use a fake phone and call a taxi from your phone number.If you've picked up a taxi at a signal that looks like it's a taxi, you are usually supposed to answer the phone but you will instead be told to drive to the nearest taxi stand.There are two big dangers in this scam. Firstly, you don't want taxi drivers to think you are not familiar with a particular route or area. Secondly, these 'taxi stands' are usually hidden behind a shopping mall, restaurant or bar where most people would assume they're safe.7. The Fake Uber or LycabikeThis is another scam that occurs all over the world – and it is a shame Hong Kong is not more successful in stopping it.If you are taken to a location where you have to take a fake taxi, this is not just a problem. It is also illegal. This type of taxi scam is just like Uber and Lycabikes in Thailand. The scam is simple: get a fake taxi – pick up your rider – and drive away. Your ride is likely to be much longer than it needs to be, but your rider is not going to receive anything in exchange.6. The Fake ApartmentA good apartment in Hong Kong will usually cost about $1,500-2,000 a month for a one-room apartment. A fake apartment will usually cost over $2,000 to build and will often be in a rather sketchy area – the most common areas for fake apartments are in Central, Wan Chai and Kowloon.Fake apartments are easy to create: they usually just need a couple of floors as decoration. These fake apartments may be very cheap to build – they're usually built from old shipping containers that are simply removed from a building to make them look new.5. The Parking ScamHong Kong taxis and private cars are constantly getting into traffic accidents, but this is not necessarily a sign that all is lost.As more people are riding their bikes to work, or using public transport to get around Hong Kong, the number of parking accidents has also increased.This is an easy scam to spot, as most accidents happen in or near parking lots. It is advisable to never park your vehicle in the street in Hong Kong or on the roads surrounding it.4. Fraudulent Credit CardsHong Kong is a very safe city, and even the most well-connected people in the world can easily get their personal information stolen by scammers. We are constantly advising everyone to use a secure online banking or payment system.This also means that you will probably never see a contactless credit card again. Scammers can buy stolen cards as easily as they could previously buy credit card numbers.

The number of new and re-invested wind farms under construction in Norway has more than doubled in two years, as it prepares to take advantage of the generous feed-in tariffs that come with being an Energiewende pioneer.The number of new and re-invested wind farms under construction from January of 2014 to June of this year was 726 megawatts, compared to 391 megawatts at this time a year ago. The number of re-invested wind farms under construction in Norway rose to 675 wind turbines in 2014, compared to 447 wind turbines in 2013, according to a new data-based report by Statens Norge.Even with the higher numbers, about half of the new wind turbines in Norway are now under construction, compared to just over a third four years ago, the report adds."This increase in new renewable energy generation is taking place across all regions of Norway," said Nils Skoog of Statens Norge, a government agency tasked with promoting the country's clean energy strategy.In a recent editorial, Skoog called on the government to accelerate its efforts to achieve a total of 100 percent clean energy supply by 2025. That goal "gives Norway the best chance to become the first country in the world to go completely renewable," Skoog argued.The data comes just days after Norway's government unveiled new incentives for wind energy.One measure, the 100 percent renewable energy target, goes into effect next year after being negotiated between environmental groups, the government and the country's largest wind turbine maker, DONG Energy, the Norwegian newspaper Dagsavisen reported Monday. It applies to new onshore wind turbines of at least 300 megawatts.More than 100 companies are expected in the coming months to build more than 4 gigawatts of wind turbines and around 700 megawatts of solar panels across the country.Dong will provide incentives of 1.1 million crowns (about $250,000) for the first two megawatts of power produced in Norway from the first offshore wind farm and 1.2 million crowns ($250,000) for the first megawatt of power in Scandinavia from the first solar farm, Kvarnemo, a major investor in offshore wind in the west of the country, according to the government agency.Also this year, Statens Norge plans to build more than 300 new wind farms in different regions of the country to meet the 100 percent renewable energy target.According to Statens Norge, the country's new wind turbines were in operation for 13 years at the end of 2013, and a third are due to be connected to the national grid by the end of 2015.Follow Stories Like This Get the Monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox.Norway, which has set the goal of reaching 100 percent renewable energy by 2025, is already home to some of the world's biggest wind farms and is expected to see them double in size over the next decade. A recent report by the Norwegian Wind Energy Association (NOWEA) said some of the country's new wind farms will be able produce electricity for more than 15 hours a day by 2050.DONG, the world leader in wind energy, has said the growth in its renewables portfolio has been at "an excellent level" since 2008.
Korean cuisine is one of my favorite cuisines of all time, and most often, people think of Korean food being either spicy or sour. However, there's only one true Korean flavor—salty. The most basic dish is "soondubu" and the most famous is kimchi, which is fermented cabbage with Korean chilies and sesame seeds. It's the ultimate salty food, and a great Korean pick-me-up after a big meal. I made this salted beef salad with leftover Korean dolmades and topped with some Korean hot radish. It's incredibly salty and sweet and so delicious!Dolmades are typically fermented red radish in Korea, and they typically have some salt left over. I prefer them just to add some more flavor and texture, so I added some of the leftover dolmades with some sweet soy sauce, toasted sesame seeds, and chili flakes mixed in. You can use Korean kimchi (Korean red cabbage) as well, but it's not traditionally as salty as what it usually looks like. Also, you don't necessarily need to eat it with a spoon, because the salty-sweet combination has enough acidity to mix in your mouth with a spoon.The salted beef salad was so satisfying! It's so salty, spicy and sweet. The tangy, sweet chili sauce paired with all of the salty, tangy, and spicy stuff is amazing. I'll be making it again and again!Try this recipe for Korean salted beef salad!Ingredients:10-15 pieces Korean beef (I used kimchi but would use Korean dolmades like this recipe)1/2 teaspoon Korean chiles4 tablespoon sweet soy sauce2 tablespoons honey1/2 teaspoon sesame seeds (or just 1/4 teaspoon sesame seeds)1/2 teaspoon chili flakes1 tablespoon sesame seeds1 tablespoon chili flakes1 tablespoon ground garlic3 garlic cloves, minced (or 1/4 – 1/2 teaspoon garlic flakes)1 ounce Korean cucumbers, sliced (I used small Asian cucumbers)1/2 cup sesame seeds1 tablespoon rice vinegar1 tablespoon Korean red chili sauce1/2 teaspoon sesame seeds1 teaspoon ground ginger2 tablespoons chopped scallions (parsley or green onion)How to eat:Toss the garlic, chili flakes, ginger, scallions, and garlic cloves together. Mix everything well, and serve with rice.
The "Pony"What's a Pony?A Pony is like a car. It's got four wheels and two front wheels. I've already described how cars work, but I'll do that one more time. Basically, the wheels are like hands. They move to the left and right and to the rear. When I say "move," I mean how they respond to the outside world. They have to respond to something, because they have "feet," and those feet have to respond to the ground. So, they're like hands with wheels. Now, the ground is like air. It's the stuff that your "feet" move over, which is sort of like the air that your "hand" moves. And in cars, there are wheels on their ground. So, there's wheels on air. So, the wheels push the ground and the wheels push up. They have to stay up.So, the Pony is a car that has four different wheels that all move together. The rear "hand" is like the front "hand," and the front "hand" on the Pony moves to the left and right, and the rear "hand" moves to the rear. In turn, the front wheels push the ground, then the rear wheels push up, and the ground pushes out of the way to keep the Pony moving. I explained this concept to a friend the other morning before work, and I explained "wheels on ground" and "wheels pushed air" together and said, "Hey, you can imagine that as cars running on electricity."So, the thing that I really want to talk about is that the Pony's four wheels don't want to always move to the left and right, or to the rear. And, the only reason why they do that is because the front "hand" wants to push up and the rear "hand" wants to push down and away from the vehicle. So, the ponies (and other vehicles) can be thought of as just a bunch of motors, which need a way to drive in a particular configuration that doesn't need wheels moving all the time.When a Pony moves, it's the front "hand" that moves the front wheels. When the motor on the rear "hand" wants to move, it pushes the rear wheels. When it's pushing the fronts, it's the rear "hand" that pushes the rear wheels, because the front wheels have been pushed down by the rear wheels until they're all the same distance from the ground.Now, when we talk about an automobile moving, most people think of the car's "front" hand being the driver's "left" hand. That's because, a long time ago, everyone took their left hand and placed it near the right handle on the steering wheel to keep the car moving as fast as possible. But, if you look at the other end of the vehicle... the "back" hand (the "right" hand), you get a car that's more than 100 years old! Because some automobiles had four wheels and other automobiles... two wheels. Now, if a car were to be made 100 years later, if a car were made with four wheels and one big handle, they would run slow! You see, a car can't drive if the vehicle is constantly moving.(Source)
"The president has gone out on the campaign trail, made a promise to the American people, and he has delivered," Ryan said. "This is a huge moment for our country."AdvertisementRyan's praise of Trump's handling of the health care crisis — he said the president "sees it for what it is — it's a crisis and his hands are tied" — is just as much an effort to build his new "friendship" with the president as it is an acknowledgment of the president's triumphalism."We're in the midst of a big transformation of the health care system in this country," said Ryan. "We're going to do it together, and we're going to do it fast, and we're going to get this done."But Trump is only a part of the story about this effort. Republicans have been waiting months, even years, for Trump to make it a priority. It took a full year for Ryan to take the White House; there was plenty of time to build a relationship with Trump before he took office. On his first full day in office, Trump invited Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Ryan to the White House for breakfast, and on Friday the two men met in Bedminster, New Jersey.[The new Obamacare fix would make premiums much, much higher — and only worsen the deficit]To be clear, Ryan's relationship with Trump goes further than that. It is more personal. Ryan has been a longtime friend of Trump's who once compared the then-candidate to Moses. They have dinner and meet over the holidays.Trump was not in the room as Ryan praised Trump, but the president was in the building. There are other Republican lawmakers who met with Trump during the day on Friday.There is also plenty of space in which for Trump to get comfortable with his party in the wake of his failed attempts to repeal Obamacare. This might be the first in which he has spent the day with Republicans. There are few opportunities in American politics for an occupant of the White House and a GOP leader to enjoy meals with the president at the White House, or for Republicans on Capitol Hill to have their first real face-to-face talk with a president.[Paul Ryan is in a tight spot on Obamacare. Now his colleagues are.]"This was an opportunity for the Speaker to get up close and personal, to get his hands on the president, and also the Speaker's offices have always been where the most productive conversations are being had for our conference," House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) told reporters on Capitol Hill on Friday.Ryan said he and Trump "had a productive discussion" about health care, and the House leader added that their conversations are "continuing." He did not elaborate on what was discussed.[Paul Ryan tells me, 'When I'm president, I'll run this country like a business.']One way Ryan can get back into the picture with the White House might be to bring on Trump's pick to head Health and Human Services, Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.), who he met with Friday night. Price, a member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, has been viewed with skepticism by many Senate Republicans and many members of his own party, but Ryan is eager to work with him."I like Tom Price — he has been supportive of us when we needed him," Ryan said. "We're going back and forth. We're having a discussion. We're coming to some decisions, but I'm hopeful that he agrees with us on our principles. We're going to stick to them."Democrats, however, are pushing back against the idea that they are a "partnership.""Instead of saying 'we're going to work together,' what is the relationship going to look like with Speaker Ryan and President Trump?" Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in a statement. "They were always at odds during the campaign. Their relationship has only deteriorated since then. We remain opposed to any and all Republican efforts to take health care away from millions."[Senate Republicans vote to roll back Obamacare, but Trump says they have not repealed yet]Trump will face increased pressure to keep his promise of repealing the Affordable Care Act and to make good on his campaign promises to replace it. In the wake of the House's vote, McConnell said the Senate planned to roll out legislation "next week" to repeal and replace Obamacare."What I'll tell you is we're going to repeal and replace. We're not having any fun, believe me," Ryan said. "We're looking forward to getting the votes, and I believe when we do we'll have enough votes in the Senate to pass something very, very quickly."Republicans are not just focused on health care. Senate Republicans are hoping to move legislation next week to boost the Mexican economy on a "
New England Patriots wide receiver Julian Edelman isn't the oldest member of the team. Not by much. But he's the oldest among those playing in the regular season, and it's not even close. Edelman may end up being the oldest player in NFL history playing regular-season football, topping the all-time age of 36 by three months. That's a very impressive feat for a player still in his second year in the league.No players have worn number 36 in their regular-season career, but the Patriots own the largest portion they will wear the number this season with five, including Edelman. A four-time Pro Bowler, Edelman has been the Patriots' go-to option this season, catching 53 passes for 636 yards and four touchdowns while splitting time with Brandon LaFell. He isn't as well-known as LaFell or as successful as Julian Edelman or Larry Fitzgerald, but he is as productive as any young receiver in the league.In addition to his production, Edelman is a leader on the team. He was the first player selected by Bill Belichick as a special teams player in 2005 and has played in all 26 games as a reserve receiver in Brady's seven-year career. He's also started 23 games as a returner, but was unable to secure a special-teams-playing gig this season.And yet, Julian Edelman is only 35 years old. He's older than every other player on the Patriots and he's still playing. That is a pretty amazing fact to consider.You can read more of the best stories from Around the NFL by clicking here.
A Florida man who called the cops after his car was reportedly stolen on his girlfriend's way to work has been spared jail.According to the News Herald, the 22-year-old from Fort Lauderdale was stopped for an apparent red light at the intersection of Federal Highway and Federal Road in Fort Lauderdale after the woman called police.

However, the woman's call to 911 was then revealed and the man was charged with obstruction of a police officer and disorderly conduct, reports The News Herald.The man was reportedly held in custody for nearly 24 hours before he was bailed out by his family.Read the full story from the News Herald below:BREAKING NEWS:Fort Lauderdale man on girlfriend's way to work, called cops, arrestedMan charged with disorderly conduct after cops say he has his hands in air at intersectionPolice call it 'a little bit of road rage' on driver© 2018 Cox Media Group.
After the success of Naughty Dog's Uncharted series, one thing that was missing when it launched its follow-ups Uncharted: The Lost Legacy and Uncharted 4: A Thief's End was a protagonist.This is a big deal, since the series' core characters are Nathan Drake and his nephew, Sam. And for the most part, this series has relied on them to carry the narrative. But The Lost Legacy and 4 featured two new playable leads for this trio's adventures, as well as a third protagonist in a side-mission that featured Elena Fisher.While fans have been clamouring for more Uncharted with a female protagonist, The Lost Legacy and 4 also included characters who are male, or non-white, or are non-American – a big departure from the earlier titles.And some people have been left very angry, as evidenced in the comments under those two posts.In an interview with Eurogamer, producer Josh Scherr talked a bit more about why Uncharted hasn't featured a female lead since the last entry."Obviously we don't want to pigeonhole a particular character into a particular gender," he explained. "But we definitely feel like the world needs to understand that our protagonist, our primary protagonist, is a man because he's the protagonist. He's the lead. He's more important."I mean, he does everything. He's so capable. We want that to really be expressed through the choices you make in the game, and what the choices mean. We want players to feel like he's just one of the guys and that their decisions mean more than they necessarily do. He's our focus, our protagonist."Scherr also said that they want to make sure it feels "new and different" to players. With Uncharted 4, the developers added in a multiplayer mode and a new character.In The Lost Legacy, Scherr said one of the most important things was to make Elena the player's emotional centre of the game. And for a number of reasons, "It was pretty challenging to create that relationship without being overly dramatic because, you know, Uncharted has always been the more grounded, the more introspective of these guys.""I think for a lot of people who have been a part of [the Uncharted series] these past two titles, it's been a bit of a challenge to be able to see Sam as our lead. And what we've tried to do is to make Elena as one of the pillars, but at the same time be able to expand upon Sam as a character as well."He said that a lot of the game's themes are "not very subtle". There's a scene in the game where Elena is walking on rooftops and she tells Nathan she loves him before falling down to a rooftop and calling him her "toy"."It was more a moment. It was a more open, more vulnerable moment where you can see how he's always had a love for this woman that he never knew about. How he never knows when to step in and how to really support her. How to really be supportive of her and hold back," Scherr said."He's so protective of her, and that's what makes him the man he's become.""That little scene there where they have that moment in that rooftop, it's interesting how it all sort of ties in and you get to see this family dynamic as it's developing. You get a little bit more backstory about how they met, and it's nice to get to see the consequences of everything they go through with Sam and why he does the things he does."You can read our full interview with Scherr, including what else the Uncharted series, for the first time, has to offer its audience.
We all want to live in an amazing future where our planet is cleaner and safe, but the truth is that such a utopia's almost never possible.Scientists from the Smithsonian Institute and Cornell University say technology could help in this regard. Their new video takes a look at the potential of artificial intelligence to make it possible to eliminate or significantly reduce pollution in real-time, before even the earliest effects of climate change.A team of scientists from Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) say they have successfully worked out the algorithms that can predict future pollution levels from the accumulation of chemicals. They claim this technology could be one way of addressing rising levels of air pollution for which human bodies have made no major breakthroughs.According to the two groups, "a number of environmental problems such as pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, air toxics, global warming, and water pollution, are caused by the combustion of fossil fuels in power plants and industrial processes and the processing of agricultural and synthetic materials and products using toxic or environmentally harmful chemicals."As a result, humanity faces the risk of destroying the world's natural ecosystems in order to achieve the economic and health benefits of a cleaner environment.Scientists say if such a technology is ever developed, it could be used to help humans reduce the amount of air pollution that is created by the chemical factories and other industrial processes."Such a system would not only provide a means to reduce toxic exhausts, but could simultaneously be used to monitor chemical emissions at industrial facilities or in the vicinity of human population centers," explains a statement issued by the MIT and Harvard universities."This work could have important public health benefits at both the global and local levels, including reduction of respiratory irritation and cancer risk associated with harmful pollutants."The two groups say their model offers the ability to detect pollutants that exist in the air over the course of months or even years. They say this would provide a method to analyze what types of pollutants might affect the air's ability to absorb sunlight and, consequently, temperatures, and how they could affect the ocean as a whole.The groups say this type of technology could also be used to monitor the health of large population centers to see how much pollution there is in terms of air pollution and how the pollution is affecting surrounding communities.In addition to tracking pollution levels from around the world, they claim they can forecast air pollution on the specific site of a city and city districts, even down to the block level.The models the scientists are developing are said to have some limitations, but they claim they'll be able to help make the global environment more resilient and avoid negative effects.The scientists suggest this technology could be a powerful tool to protect people all over the world. "The new approach is a key way to enhance our ability to understand how to address many of the world's most consequential environment threats. In this context, our research shows the power of combining the techniques of natural system modeling and environmental engineering to find solutions to the many environmental challenges that persist today."They say there's still a lot the research team needs to figure out but they say its an exciting technology to watch develop.You can read more about the technology at the links below.
Lifeline of the Americas' Newest Mobile OutreachAt Lifeline of the Americas, we are committed to ending the cost of a mobile phone as a lifeline to Americans. The Lifeline of the Americas program began as a way to provide the necessary subsidy to keep mobile phones affordable—but it soon grew in scope to include hundreds of other services to improve a customer's quality of life. And the result, according to our research. Our new survey of more than 1000 Lifeline of the Americas participants indicate that 90 percent think that Lifeline of the Americas has been a positive addition to their life, with 84 percent saying it's "good or extremely good."Lifeline of the Americas and the program's current and former administration have been making a significant number of decisions and implementing a number of policies that have proven to be positive for Lifeline of the Americas' participants. Most importantly, the Lifeline of the Americas program has benefited from the dedication and hard work of many dedicated volunteers. The program's goal of raising $100 million per year in the United States has been accomplished successfully. In addition, Lifeline's participants have shown that a significant number of their financial and other services are actually benefitting them and their families in life rather than the program's administrative requirements.More than 200,000 volunteers are currently enrolled in Lifeline of the Americas, making it one of the largest volunteer programs in the United States. Over the course of the program's five-year history, the Department of Defense, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and others have donated more than $500 million worth of services to participants in the U.S. and in Puerto Rico. A number of these services include the use of private vehicles and the use of military helicopters to transport equipment and people from states that are covered by Lifeline of the Americas to those that aren't. In addition, about 100 Air Force One-style aircraft have been used by participants at times during the program's history as air transport or as part of disaster relief efforts.As the program's largest private sector donor, the US Department of Education has also contributed more than $300 million to Lifeline of the Americas since the program was launched in 1999. The program also benefited from a number of federal actions from 2001 to the present day, including the 2008 amendments that amended the Lifeline Act to provide Lifeline of the Americas with funding through May 31, 2015 and the 2014 extension of that funding through May 31, 2020. Additional federal support for Lifeline of the Americas came at the federal level through several other appropriations acts, including FY2009 and FY2012 appropriations for the Department of Education, FY2009 appropriations for Federal Communications Commission, FY2010 appropriations for the Department of Health and Human Services, FY2003 appropriations for the Department of Agriculture, FY2004 appropriations for the Department of Housing and Urban Development, FY2005 appropriations for the Department of Education, FY2006 appropriations for the Department of Health and Human Services, FY2007 appropriations for the Department of Commerce, and FY2010 appropriations for the Federal Communications Commission. These appropriations were significant in terms of giving new lifeline to the program, enabling volunteers working to help those outside of the program to keep the phone bills down and to provide their own services, as well as in terms of helping to cover some of the initial costs for participants.Our survey is the first ever survey of the experiences of Lifeline participants conducted in English by an academic institution. This research project, sponsored by the Lifeline of the Americas initiative of the USGBC, is led by the U.S.GBC and produced and conducted by the University of Connecticut. Results are available on our website.The Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences (CASB) sponsored Lifeline of the Americas Survey. This study was conducted by the University of Connecticut's Institute for Research on Poverty.
The last month has seen a new flood of high-level arrests of senior officials that are further weakening the rule of law, democracy and transparency on the island.Many cases of corruption and tax evasion have been uncovered. Others point towards the use of government influence to promote business interests, often at the expense of citizens of the island.Some of the suspects include the former prime minister and former president, Julio Borges; the president of the Senate, Alejandro Maldonado; three ex-ministers, Fernando Díaz, Emilio Álvarez and Jose Carlos Galán, and the governor of the Cojuangcos province, Ciro Caminero, who were all arrested in late October 2017.Borges, a former member of the ruling PRI who was ousted in a landslide victory for the PRD (Partido Liberal), served as president between 1993 and 2000. He has since been in exile in South Africa.In early September 2017, the former head of the Central Bank and current congressman Carlos Guzmán was detained in his home in a drug-related operation carried out in cooperation with the Federal Police.His son also allegedly participated in some of the activities. The father's whereabouts and status are unknown.Former president Maldonado was arrested on 15 September by Mexican authorities based on "suspicions of money laundering" involving oil and gas rights in Mexico and the Gulf of Mexico in exchange for money paid to an intermediary in Panama. He has since been released and in September 2017 was sentenced to six years imprisonment and was released in October 2017.In late September, two former Interior Ministers, Angelino Alfaro and Alberto Gonzalez, were detained by Mexican prosecutors on accusations of corruption, money laundering and other abuses of power. It is still unclear whether they were charged and detained on legal grounds or merely detained in search of documents they could use to discredit current and former politicians.In May, a former governor and former chairman of the Chamber of Deputies from the PRD (Partido Liberal) José Ramón Bocadini was arrested in relation to the alleged embezzlement of funds from a state water utility and other investigations. In his defense, the former governor claimed he only took the money because he was in a legal conflict in his own party, the PRD (Partido Liberal) and to "prevent the party from imploding".Another former member of the PRD (Partido Liberal), Edgar Ceballos, a former director of the General Intelligence Agency, was arrested on 8 March 2018, on claims of embezzlement, corruption and money laundering, as well as for involvement in illegal trafficking of children and drugs.Bocadini and Ceballos are former allies who are now reportedly negotiating release through a plea bargain.In late July 2018, Fernando Díaz was detained after giving a false name in connection with the investigation of drug gangs. The mayor of the capital city, Cebu City for over 20 years had been under investigation and arrested on 6 October 2018. Ceballos is said to have been in direct contact with Díaz for more than a decade while the latter served as mayor from 2000 to 2014. The Mayor's defense has so far been denied by the government.Juan Carlos Abad de la Cruz, the head of the Public Treasury, was detained on 21 August 2017 after being questioned in connection with alleged financial irregularities and corruption under President Rodrigo Duterte that led authorities to believe he could have laundered dirty money. On 10 July 2017, he denied all allegations and was given a suspended prison sentence of 30 days.Amongst the more surprising arrests of high-level corrupt officials, a former mayor and the former Director of the Public Treasury of Albay Region, Rafael Bato, was arrested in the central business district in Quezon City on 26 August 2017.Another former mayor of Albay and now deputy mayor of Manila, Jovito Palpar, was arrested on 14 September 2017 in Laguna, Laguna Seca after his vehicle was stopped by the police while he was apparently using his "fecal and urine-containing material" as part of his medical research.Former city administrator of Davao, Rolando Espinosa, was arrested in mid-July by Philippine National Police (PNP) with eight others during a raid in the city of Davao. Espinosa was detained in connection with possible violation of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices ActAnother former mayor, Rolando Espinosa, a former city administrator of Davao and now deputy mayor of Manila, was arrested in mid-July by Philippine National Police (PNP) with eight others during a raid in the city of Davao.

In an exclusive interview with the New York Daily News, the man accused of the Boston Marathon bombings, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, said he and his younger brother had been in contact for years and was still in touch with his old friend. In the exclusive story that will appear in the May 2 edition of the New York Daily News, Tamerlan Tsarnaev denies being the suicide bomber, who killed three and injured 264 others at the Boston Marathon a week ago. Also in the interview that will run in Tuesday's edition, Tsarnaev said he was surprised that the FBI put out a press release about the case this week and gave no details about the evidence. "How could they just leave me like this? Why? They can release anything they want to," Tsarnaev said. However, in the New York Daily News story, Tsarnaev claims he and Mamedi's mother have recently come under pressure from the FBI. "Tamerlan now sees the FBI as his enemy because Tamerlan considers the FBI the main enemy of Islam, according to Mamedi's mother," the Daily News reported. "It seems Tamerlan's hatred for the FBI has grown to the point it has become personal."The elder Tsarnaev brother's comments come as the father of slain Massachusetts Gov. Sean Parnell told FOX News on Sunday, "That person doesn't know how to live to be 100." In the Sunday interview, father John Parnell added that in terms of Tamerlan, his son's health has improved and that "the time is still coming when we won't be able to help them." The younger Tsarnaev brother, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, faces federal murder charges.Tamerlan Tsarnaev was being held without bail Sunday. His lawyers will meet to consider his next steps on Monday, according to the Boston Herald. The elder Tsarnaev brother is a naturalized U.S. citizen from Kyrgyzstan. In 2006, Tamerlan and his older brother Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was arrested at their college dormitory in Massachusetts and were accused of setting off two homemade pressure-cooker bombs near the Boston Marathon finish line. Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed in a shootout with police, apparently with his younger brother Dzhokhar in the wake of the bombings at the marathon. Tamerlan Tsarnaev was buried in New Bedford, Mass. Thursday.Dzhokhar Tsarnaev remained on the FBI's "no-fly watch list" with two exceptions, and was questioned as part of a terrorism investigation in January 2011 before he returned to the U.S., the Washington Post reported. The report also stated that Tsarnaev's older brother has changed his appearance since his arrest in Boston.Tamerlan Tsarnaev reportedly was not known to FBI agents as having any violent crimes on his record, but the brothers are linked in family law court paperwork, with one family member alleging, "I am scared that he has extremist sympathies."UPDATE:CNN's Lisa Ling reports on a new revelation on the Tsarnaevs' parents:
When I was in college and a student there was a guy named Michael. Michael was from Chicago, and he took a job in our community. And it was always so important to him. He worked at a little store on the outskirts of town, and he'd drive around our neighborhood, telling stories and sharing stories. And he knew everyone, in that way. He knew everybody, from the kid on his bike to the lady who was waiting in line at 7 a.m. for coffee. And he became a friend to them all.The thing was, Michael was a nice guy. He liked music. He liked to read. He enjoyed a good laugh. He had a good soul about him. And he enjoyed the company of people.But there was one thing about Michael that he was different from anybody else in the neighborhood. Michael couldn't get a job. He didn't come into our community, so we didn't see him. I can remember Michael working at a shop near campus. One day he came in and took care of this woman's purse for a minute, and that was his day of work. And for the next two days, we didn't see him. We didn't know where he was.But every night we saw some sort of shadow or a shadow of Michael, like a shadow that was chasing him. In the middle of college, when the jobs were sparse, Michael would take a shower, and the shadow would chase him through the halls. I'm thinking it's like a little bit of something you see in the movies. You just feel afraid, and it's always there, even though you know that isn't Michael.But some nights it was terrifying. And we never knew if he was coming back or not.There were days we didn't even go outside. We'd sit outside with our books and watch the news. We'd talk about Michael and then it would be time for bed and that would be the end.One day he came back to our campus.And it was almost at the moment when he wanted us to start going outside, when he asked me, "Michael, do you want to see the world?"And I remember looking up and there he was sitting in the chair.Before he came, he just sat on my bed and told me all about it.And he went from being a little kid to telling me how, back in Chicago, they used to take people out in boats and send them out to sea to kill sharks, and some fisherman would throw their catch overboard, and there were sharks that would eat every last one. And sometimes I wonder now, if Michael could see what he went through in the world, what he would choose to change. How would he be different?I remember telling him that this life was difficult, but the next thing he said was, "I choose to be happy."So I was like, wow, Michael. You mean to tell me you're happy here?And he looked at me and he said, "You'll always be here, Michael. You always will be. You'll always find your friends here."Michael, to me, was a symbol of something else. Michael showed me just how many people had found a way to be different in this world. And he showed me how people could be different, and that it was possible. And that was something that I've always held close to my heart. As a kid and as a teacher, what Michael taught me was that people can be different and that's okay and that we should fight to be different. And it was the most beautiful thing.It got me thinking.I was always a writer. Michael taught me to write, but he taught me to be kind. I've always been kind to kids. Michael was an example of that. Michael is someone I looked up to.And then one day while I was writing about Michael he had an amazing idea.Michael wanted to be the kind of man his parents never wanted him to be. He wanted to write books and be a poet.And he began working on a novel and he just kept going, and writing letters, and writing, and writing, and writing, and he kept writing.I wanted to share that letter.It was the last thing he wrote, about what he wanted to do. He couldn't finish his novel, so he sent it to me. And I told him I couldn't write it.I told him I didn't have time to write it, and I just couldn't do it.But he didn't care.He sent it to me anyway.He wrote, "I just wanted to wish you the best."And I said, I'll write you a letter tomorrow.He said I'd be proud of you.

As the battle between Hillary Rodham Clinton and Sen. Barack Obama continues, one of the issues that might be most pivotal is one that is being left largely unspoken: gun control."It's a tough one," Clinton said of the issue at the 2008 convention. "I voted against the Brady bill when I was a Senator, although I haven't always voted as I should on Second Amendment issues."As she mulls a run for the White House, Clinton is facing a battle to prove to the Democratic base she's no more of a gun control advocate than other Democrats. And she's trying to do so without offending any of her liberal base supporters. (See video below.)But it remains in Clinton's political toolbox to appeal to the most liberal Democrat about gun control issues. She has used the issue before, and will likely again on the campaign trail.On Monday Clinton delivered two speeches.At a campaign event in Orlando attended by nearly 700 on the NRA-sponsored NRA convention, Clinton touched on some gun control measures, including an assault weapons ban. In New York City two days later, Clinton spoke to a gathering of progressives at a breakfast sponsored by the liberal Center for American Progress.On May 17, 2011, Hillary Clinton was sworn in as secretary of state, having been endorsed by Barack Obama two months earlier and by Vice President Joe Biden, the former senator who is now her running mate, in the 2008 campaign.Clinton appeared before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for the first time the day after the attack on the U.S. mission in Benghazi, Libya, during which U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans died.On her first day in office, Hillary Clinton issued a statement about the attacks and the administration's actions following them."I continue to believe that we need to take whatever steps we can to ensure that individuals like Chris Stevens and Glen Doherty are not put in danger -- whether we are dealing with the terrorists who planned this or those whose actions may be motivated by their anger," she said.In a statement, she said Stevens "deserves great credit for having been one of our earliest to go into Benghazi, and there are so many Americans in far too many parts of the world who have given so much in service to our country. Chris is an inspiration to us all."The following day, Hillary Clinton gave a speech about terrorism."It has been just two years since the death of Osama bin Laden," Clinton said. "We face a challenge here from al Qaeda and its affiliates and its followers that we have never before seen, and it is not limited to our region. The terrorist network has spread to every region in the world. And it is not only al Qaeda, either. It is a network that can attack us anywhere -- in some parts of the world and in others. And we must make sure we don't let them."She continued, "We have a lot of work to do to fight and defeat terrorist networks.""The terrorists have also taken advantage of new technology," Clinton said. "They are sending more messages and using more methods to reach out to young people -- a generation who don't understand the values of freedom. If we don't educate and motivate our young people today, we will lose America to terrorists."In October, 2011, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton announced the release of 22 Yemeni detainees from a Guantánamo Bay prison for the first time under Obama."This is an extraordinary day for America, the Yemenis, and our global coalition," Clinton said in a video message to reporters who assembled for the announcement. "As soon as this transfer is completed, and we know it will, it has taken the work of all of us to secure the release of these detainees and to release prisoners from other countries as well."A year earlier, President Obama announced the release of the last of the Taliban detainees in Afghanistan."For more than a decade, these courageous men and women in uniform have stood strong against the most powerful and dangerous terrorist organization in the world," the president said Tuesday in the White House Rose Garden. "For years, they risked their lives to keep us, and the people they protected, safe from a network of enemies that was plotting to kill us, and to overthrow governments that stood in their way."In another statement issued just hours before he left office, President Barack Obama said that "as we look toward a new chapter in Afghanistan, we know all signs point to America's ability to succeed."President Obama's administration, however, has been accused of releasing detainees over concerns they were too dangerous to be imprisoned again.The issue was brought up Monday at a Senate hearing about an inspector general's report detailing security lapses at the detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba."In order to provide a clear understanding about why the detainees at Guantanamo continue to remain, I will direct you to

Gravity Falls : "Do you want to play a game?""Yeah! I just remembered what we could do!""Awesome! Who has to make it?""Me!" — Dipper and Mabel in "Grunkle Stan Strikes Again""Grunkle Stan Strikes Again" is the eighteenth episode of Gravity Falls and the ninety-fourth episode overall. It debuted on September 8, 2011. It was written by Alex Hirsch, directed by Adam Mansbach, and featured a storyboard by Michael DiMauro.SynopsisDipper has a very important job, and Mabel has to convince Dipper that he can do it with her. But when his parents show up, Mabel is afraid that Stan is going to kick her out...PlotA day at the jobMabel wakes early, because the twins promised her something when Dipper comes inside. Dipper goes downstairs just as Mabel says she's leaving. Mabel tells them "good luck". Mabel says she'll be up all night, and that, since she doesn't sleep in an attic, she'll be fine. Dipper goes to go get dinner. He meets Stan, who asks to be introduced. Dipper says his name when he greets him, to which Stan says his name also. Stan gives his phone number to Dippers for a job. Dipper gives him a business card and gives Stan a business card for Wendy . He leaves Dipper to go get dinner, and Stan takes his job card away. Dipper is worried what Stan is thinking of when he said his phone number.Stan comes out from the kitchen door, and tells Dipper that the job will start in an hour and it's in the warehouse. He starts to go to work. Dipper tells him to use the car, but Stan tells him to stay there. When Dipper asks him what the job is, Stan replies that it's a secret, so they'll try to give it a secret name. Dipper is very surprised, because Stan said they could call it "Grunkle Stan Strikes Again".Stan gets into the car. When Dipper looks out the car window, he sees several things that are similar to a game, like the ones Dipper played in college. Stan sees a box on the road with a red sticker on it that says, "MEGA-THUMB," and he says "MEGA-TUM-BANG" when Dipper looks at the car.Stan gets out of the car and goes to the warehouse, where a big red cube is sitting. He looks around for the cube, and then gets out to find out if the cube's on fire. He opens up a box that seems like it could hold a fire extinguisher, but it doesn't. Stanley comes out from there and looks at the fire, and Stan's eyes glow when he sees it. The cube is on fire, and the fire extinguisher would not help.Stan goes to the front gates and looks around. He gets out to ask Wendy if he can't get into school with all this. Wendy is in a back room with a computer, so she tells him to stand right in front of her. Wendy looks over the computer, which makes the letters "B-T-T-K-E-R" flash. Wendy gets back in the back room and gets out a book. She starts to read some of the words, but quickly gets distracted by the flash coming from the cube. Stan comes out from there and sees the flashing cubes. A giant cube appears, and it looks like it could crush Dipper.Stan looks at the cube, and then finds out how to unlock it. If he tries to lift it, then Mabel will not get a high score. After doing that, he will gain the password, and the cube should lift at zero points while Mabel gets the high score. However, that does not happen, so Stan has to run around the building, looking for where Mabel is. Dipper then finds a door in the school that says, "FREAKOUTS" on it, that looks like a security code, and then he unlocks it.Mabel is playing with the high score list, and has to get a high score, like "2.00", because that's what one would have to enter to get Mabel the high score. Mabel does a score, but then gets a low score, so now she has to pick a high score. She says that her only other goal is to get a bad score, and she guesses that one score will be the best. She wants to get a new score, and she guesses 2.00 but then her score is a low number."I think I'm just not good enough." - MabelShe decides that the first thing she needs to do is get the high score
We are going to learn how to use the JavaFX API in our own projects. After that we are going to move to using the XtremeGUI library and its XML based GUI. We are going to create a GUI that uses an XAML based layout file.We first go to the class declaration. We use the JavaFX Class library. We use the following.private static final String className = @"java.awt.event.ActionEvent"; [NonSerialized] public static final Class<?> className = new Class();class Name//public static final class Name@Overrideprotected void handleClick(ActionEvent e) { System.out.println("name is " + e.getActionDesc().getTarget().getActionType() + " of " + e.getActionActionDesc().getTarget().getActionDesc()); } 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 //public static final class Name//public static final class Name@Overrideprotected void handleClick ( ActionEvent e ) { System . out . println ( "name is " + e . getActionDesc ( ) . getTarget ( ) . getActionType ( ) + " of " + e . getActionActionDesc ( ) . getTarget ( ) . getActionDesc ( ) ) ; }public static Text text = new Text();public Text text//public static Text text@Overrideprotected void handleClick(ActionEvent e) { System.out.println("text is " + e.getActionDesc().getTarget().getActionType() + " of " + e.getActionActionDesc().getTarget().getActionDesc()); }public ActionCommandAction command;public ActionCommandAction command//public class ActionCommandAction@Overrideprotected void handleClick(ActionEvent e) { System.out.println("command is " + e.getActionDesc().getTarget().getActionType() + " of " + e.getActionActionDesc().getTarget().getActionDesc()); }public ActionCommandAction command;public ActionCommandAction command//public class ActionCommandActionThen we modify our start() method.Here you can see that the JavaFX classes and interfaces are implemented via the private static variable.//private static class MyActionCommand() private static double x,y,z; public double x(double xX, double xY, double xZ) { return xX*xZ + xY*xX+ xZ*xY; } public double y(double yX, double yY, double yZ) { return yX*yY + yY*yX+ yZ*yY; } public double z(double zX, double zY, double zZ) { return zX*zY+ zY*zX+ zZ*zY; } public static ActionCommand actionCommand = new ActionCommandImpl(); actionCommand.init(); actionCommand.handleClick(new ActionCommandAction(this));Now in line 5 we add a public static void method to store the ActionCommand with the method start(ActionCommand) .Here you can see that we add the getActionDesc().getTarget().getActionDesc() to the start method.public static void start(ActionCommand actionCommand) { actionCommand.init(); actionCommand.handleClick(new ActionCommandAction(this)); }Now in line 3 we create a Text object.Here you can see that is created by writing a public static String method to get the Text as a String.public static String getText() { return String.format(@"This is text: {0}", actionCommand.getActionDesc().getTarget().getActionDesc().getTarget().getActionActionDesc()); }Then in line 5 we create a new ActionCommandImpl class.The ActionCommandImpl interface defines a few methods to get an action command with it's name and type.public static ActionCommandImpl actionCommandImpl = new ActionCommandImpl();The default implementation uses the name of the ActionCommand class as the text in an xml file and uses the ActionCommand for the type. This allows us to use the default implementation.The new implementation uses the ActionCommand class as the text and uses the type ActionCommand for the name of the action command. This allows us to use the new implementation. When creating ActionEventEvents in XML we can also use ActionCommand for the name and type.Now that we set up the actions we want to respond to in our UI we are going to update the default implementations of the start(), init(), handleClick(), getActionDesc() and getActionCommand() methods to respond to the actions we have defined
I'm not here to tell you not to listen to Kanye West. And I'll admit that some of my favorite albums are the ones that were left in my queue even though I had no intention of listening to them. I'd rather look for something new and exciting, whatever that means. There are a million excellent choices out there, and I've heard them all. There are plenty of records that I've never even heard of, and a few I've heard but haven't finished yet. So just keep it as simple as possible. I'm here to help.I'm starting with some recent albums, then moving on from there. Here goes.Fashion Week: Week in Reviewby The A.V. ClubA new magazine takes a look back at the styles and personalities that define this month as well as its top designers and trends.AdvertisementA Day To Remember — This band from Louisville, Kentucky, has a sound that is completely different than most bands — which is both a refreshing and refreshingly different turn. If you love heavy metal or punk but have trouble connecting with the current crop of bands on the mainstream scene, try A Day To Remember. Their album, The War, is available on iTunes and will make it easier for you to find someone who has never heard anything they do.The Black Keys — This rock and roll band from Detroit has been doing this for decades, but it hasn't always been easy. Their latest record, Turn Blue, is everything you've been searching for in a rock album: gritty, fast, and full of the raw joy of playing rock music for live audiences. A band's entire lives are spent building songs for live performances, and the result of that effort is in this collection — but in a much more entertaining and exciting way.Deerhoof — This Canadian four-piece are a unique and interesting sound and have been releasing music that is not just punk, but alternative and post-hardcore. With their fourth album, they have taken a darker road, but it works. Check out their last album, In Search Of The Silver Lotta Coin, and look for Deerhoof to go on tour in support of the record.Kanye West — Kanye West has been pushing new boundaries in fashion, but nothing surprises me. His new album SWISH will almost certainly get a lot of attention, but the best thing you could do is to give it a listen. There are some classic Kanye releases, and some that haven't quite caught on yet. But whatever the case, I'm sure he's going to do great this summer.Rihanna — The queen of pop is not breaking new territory with her new album, ANTI; she hasn't strayed far from her previous sound, but she has expanded her range. For starters, you'll find a lot of different styles of music (her biggest hit "Diamonds" is even from another singer). But there's more. I love Rihanna's stage presence; she is truly the best showman alive. She's really good at communicating via both singing and facial expressions and, if you think that's too hard to do, Rihanna has all the vocal tracks recorded for her next album. A good one, perhaps.AdvertisementHaim — I'm not even sure this band exists, but they have a great voice. The members of Haim have some impressive skills in the studio. Their sophomore album, This Isn't a Scene [Forthcoming from Polyvinyl], was a very enjoyable listen.Mura Masa — This American rapper has been doing the rounds in Los Angeles and Brooklyn (not all of them are happy about it). There is definitely something else going on when you listen to this guy. His most recent album, R&B/RAP-Fusion [JAYS Records], is a big hit, but his past work also proves to be very worthy of your time.AdvertisementP.O.S — P.O.S does it again. His debut, Sucker for Pain, is a very good album. I have my doubts as to the amount of effort and thought that went into this one. But he's good at what he does, and I'm sure he'll find enough time to make another fantastic album.Rico Santos– A rapper who started in the UK and moved to New York to record his own music in the '90s, Rico Santos continues to churn out a series of great records, like his latest LP, My Brother, My Brother. The record might be a little bit darker than the records he's made earlier in his career, but it's still a good one, complete with some catchy hooks.AdvertisementThe Black Keys — We could talk about their record for as long as we wanted, the one you probably bought and never listened to, but what you should pay attention to is the way it sounds when you listen
Rough Cut - 'Dirty Deeds' (from The Best of Oasis)The Best of Oasis, from 'The Best of Oasis' CD/DVDBy David Levey.For a band like Oasis, it can be difficult to tell them apart. Even after five albums, and with over 20 million copies sold, there are still many who only know them for the live shows.Although their music has been the subject of a number of books (including a book and DVD by Simon Reynolds published last fall) and documentaries (including an hour-long DVD from 2009) they have only had a handful of live DVD releases (see below – 'Live, Not Just On Stage').However, the next one that looks to delve deeply into the music, lives and songs of the group is 'Dirty Deeds', from 2006.In many ways, the band sound like the original members of the band in the late 1980s; as they do with their music and live shows; but with the added element of a modern pop band.Much of the music is upbeat, with a strong 'funk' tone that comes through on the tracks 'The Miracle' and 'Biffy Clyro' (the title track and second album) 'The Best of Oasis', the first single from the Blu-ray/DVD release of 2006 (which will arrive in Australia and New Zealand soon), is also a very strong example for an example of this, along with the album and DVD (see below).The album and DVD release by Sony BMG in 2006 is a very important and significant addition to album listening. With it comes a deluxe edition of the music that shows the best of the best from the albums during their heyday. The songs are arranged by original members of the band of the time and, by virtue of the CD/DVD, the best of the best live gigs are preserved.The first track to be broadcast to television, and a classic, is "Don't Look Back In Anger". The song was originally written by Liam, and is a very popular song with young Brits, especially those on the verge of puberty and those that have just gotten into their teenage years.It also has a 'hard core' fanbase that has a very negative view on the band and their music.However, this song was a hit with the music business, with the song being on the BBC's top ten rock'n'roll songs of all-time list and having been remade as a big blockbuster video game by Sony and Rockstar, a spin-off from Grand Theft Auto (which has sold more than 100 million copies in the US alone).But as is the story with many of Oasis' songs (see below), they have never done much to try and make money from them.Even though the song has done well, the album doesn't include the song, but rather gives more of their 'alternate' sound, featuring music by Dave and Liam to replace the original songs such as "Don't Look Back In Anger". With this, the song was re-recorded, and eventually released as The Essential Oasis on July 15, 2006.The story goes like this. Back in 2002, during Liam's stay in America, Liam approached producer John Leckie to request that John remix the song for the DVD and album. The result was, of course, the very successful remix of "Don't Look Back In Anger", with Liam and the original band replacing the original band for their new version, and eventually the very popular album single 'Don't Look Back In Anger'.The song had, and has, a very '80s/'90s rock tone to it, even though it is a rock group. For a band that has no original members at all (except for Noel Gallagher) that is quite an interesting twist, and it has been covered by The White Stripes, the Pretenders, etc."I Don't Want To Know" was originally written by Noel and Oasis' drummer Andy Rourke (see below). After a number of versions with different drummers, an overdubbed version was played on Oasis' 1995 tour of Asia, and is a typical Oasis' song."Innocent When You Dream" is one of the best examples of the band's songwriting. The lyrics are not only beautiful, but Oasis have created a very poppy style of playing, with an excellent guitar solo in the middle."I'll Be Your Mirror" was originally written by Noel Gallagher and a very talented singer-songwriter named Simon Patterson. The song sounds like the sound of the '80s pop band ABBA, but is in fact the first line of the original song, written in 1984 and still in the works.This song was one of the last tracks the original band recorded in the studio before leaving for
Rioting began on Thursday to shut down the St. Paul campus of the University of Minnesota-Morris as protesters confronted university administrators over allegations of a racism problem.In video obtained by the Star Tribune and reported late Thursday by the Minneapolis Star-Tribune's Michael Newman, a group of protesters confronts the president of the school, Eric Kaler, as a group of young people try to organize themselves.University administrators are also seen walking in a hallway, presumably to take cover from protesters on the third floor. Others are seen walking between classes in an apparent attempt to keep protesters from disrupting classes.The students on Thursday were protesting how long it took the university to investigate a racist email allegedly sent to black students. One of the four professors quoted in the email, John Abi-Mabsud, told a newspaper on Friday that he did not write the email. The four people who have claimed responsibility for the email are part of the Black Lives Matter student group at Minnesota.Students in many of the protests at the Minnesota campus this week appeared to be calling for Kaler's resignation or firing, but those calls were countered by the protesters' call to remain peaceful.[St. Paul protester calls for Kaler resignation, demands to keep protests peaceful]The protest also was over the university's decision to cancel a meeting Thursday between students and Kaler. The protesters claimed that the decision was made without their agreement."I feel the university has treated us like animals," said Alyssa Bittner to the Star Tribune. She is vice president of student affairs, a position that includes taking students to meetings with administrators.In interviews Thursday, at least four people at the protest said that they were affiliated with Black Lives Matter — Black Lives Matter chapters on each of the campuses were involved in Wednesday's protests.St. Paul Police DepartmentIn an emailed statement sent from his Minneapolis office on Thursday afternoon, Chancellor Mark Schlissel said that he was not aware of police presence during the riot, although he acknowledged that "police officers kept the streets clear, making sure that the protesters did not endanger the community.""I have been speaking with numerous leaders on the campus about these events and we are working with them to restore order," Schlissel's statement said."We are determined to ensure that an appropriate way are to resolve these issues as the students and campus come together to discuss these issues," he continued.In the Minneapolis Star Tribune story, the university president said that he "had no intention of jeopardizing the safety or health of any students and faculty, including those who were involved in the protests. They were part of a peaceful protest."According to the Star Tribune, the statement, which came a day after the riot, said that students wanted to "bring to light a serious issue.""If students do protest after the end of a class time slot, that is up to them," Schlissel's statement said. "The university will be working closely with both students and leaders to create the appropriate opportunity for discussions.""This is the worst I've seen here," he also said. The student activists that called on him to step down were "absolutely" wrong because they "didn't know about what's going on," he said.Protesters did not want to talk to Kaler, Schlissel said, "in part because it puts me in a difficult position in terms of them and the university, in part because it puts them in a difficult position in terms of me."It was unclear how far demonstrators could have gotten without being confronted by police.University Police Chief Kevin Brookhiser said in a statement Thursday evening that police and university officials did "not have enough time to fully respond" to the demands of students, whom he said have "the right to protest peacefully.""Police did go directly to the residence halls to communicate with students to let them know we had a large number of officers, because of the magnitude of the protest," Brookhiser said."That was not our intent and that's on me," he said.
"You know, I've got two sons now, and they're two of the finest men I've ever known," he said Monday morning in Ohio. "Both served their country. Both went to combat, both were wounded and were coming home, and they both lost their lives on that hill there."He is referring to the July 4 memorial event for those four soldiers at Virginia's Arlington National Cemetery. "They made the ultimate sacrifice," he said. "If I had to do it over, I'd do the same again. It was the right thing to do.""The problem is, that it's hard for a father to put his hand on his son's shoulder, and say, 'You know, you're going to go off that cliff with these other idiots because they've been told they can do anything, and they don't learn.'"As one of many critics of what he considers to be the national push for gun control, the president has been criticized for failing to directly speak out about gun violence. Obama's campaign has pointed out that the president has used the words "gun violence" and "violence against women" in the same sentence and often during speeches, leading critics to raise doubts about whether he is personally involved.The president said Monday that his son was on the other side of his gun control stance."I had no hesitation in taking these extraordinary measures, because I knew that if there was a way that if you could help just one child survive, then the impact that would be for all of us is worth thinking about," he said.
1 of 1 2 of 1The University of B.C. is investigating a number of allegations of sexual assault that are being investigated by the Vancouver Police Department (VPD) under the new B.C. Sexual Assault Protection Act (B.C.SAPA).An internal review carried out by UBC Human Rights, Equity & Inclusion, the campus's sexual discrimination policy provider, concluded that one sexual assault incident last year that "appears to be a systemic problem" has been reported to UBC's administration. This report's findings have been made public."UBC condemns sexual assault and has been working actively with our students on this issue through our ongoing awareness of how we can all be safer and healthier on campus. The allegation of sexual assault against an UBC student in October 2016 was thoroughly investigated by the UBC Office of the General Counsel, the police, and the RCMP," an UBC spokesperson wrote in an email to the Straight.In November 2016, a complainant told the UBC Office of the General Counsel that on March 21, 2016, she was sexually assaulted by an unknown, male student. She filed a complaint with the VPD (Police Services Division) on December 3, 2016 and the VPD referred the case to the VPD's Sexual Assault and Child Abuse Section (SAACAS) on Thursday, January 5, 2017. On January 12, 2017, the SAACAS unit interviewed the alleged victim who has since withdrawn his complaint.The alleged rape happened inside and outside of a residence, and involved a second female student."This office will be looking into the following allegations and what UBC is doing to address/prevent them:"1.

The second part of the series covering the new generation of hardware devices from Intel.The hardware is getting better, but the software has notWhen it comes to making hardware and software work together, things are about to get more complicated.The new generation of hardware devices from Intel includes the Atom x7-Z8700, x5-Z8700, and the Z87 chipset, the Haswell i7-4770K and i7-4770 processor family, and the new Broadwell U-series CPUs. That is a lot to handle, and it will not be an easy challenge.The challenge is even worse, however, when you add in all the software software that will need to be updated. I'll give you a short preview of what these things will bring to the table, but I will also give you a few tips on what you need to do if you want to get ahead.For the best experience, it is crucial to use the latest versions of your operating system (e.g. Windows 7, Windows 8, or Windows 8.1). This way, you will not risk encountering any bugs that can be easily fixed only by later Intel updates. Also make sure that you keep your motherboard and CPU updated. To get the latest software updates, use the Intel support link on the product packaging and install them using Intel's driver control panel. This way, you don't even have to boot from a USB flash drive.Intel's new X99 chipset (aka Z97) is an Intel platform with the Broadwell U or Haswell U processors. For now, all Intel x3 Intel processors are supported, but not all x3e or Xeon chips are. You'll be able to use newer CPUs like the i5-4570 and i5-4590 as well as the i3-4360, which are compatible with most Haswell, Broadwell, and Skylake U-series CPUs.This should bring some interesting developments over the next few months.Note: This post will only cover the Haswell Z8700 and Z97 chipset. The other newer processors, the i7-4770K, i7-4770S, and i5-4670 will still have their own dedicated posts in the future.The Intel Z87 chipset is the one that will be used in the upcoming Skylake and Kaby Lake CPUs. It is the successor of the earlier Z87. In fact, it is the first chip from Intel to support the LGA 2011 socket.The Z87 chipset can be used in any Haswell, Broadwell, or Skylake system, and it supports both DDR3L and DDR4 memory. It supports quad channel DDR4 memory, so you can go all out with your GPU.On its own, the chip is a solid one, but it has some shortcomings due to the number of chipsets built into it, which make a mess even worse. You need to understand exactly how it works before you can install it inside a system.To install the Z87 chipset inside a system, you will need at least one of the following cards:Motherboard: Z87-Deluxe/i7-4770K or Z87-SP Z87-Deluxe/i7-4770KORCPU: Skylake or the latest Haswell CPUORGraphics: HD Graphics 530 or HD Graphics 4600OROther: LGA 2011 motherboard (e.g. Z87-DELUXE)Note that there are other combinations available, but you need to make sure that they are compatible with the Z87 chipset. For example, using a Skylake CPU with a Z87 chipset will not work - it will not boot.To start, you must first identify the motherboard of the computer you want to install it on. There are now many different Z87 motherboards that are available, some are even compatible with both Haswell and Broadwell chips.I personally recommend using the Z87-Deluxe. I personally use it, mostly because of its compatibility with Skylake. I have even used it with Kaby Lake, but it was really a mistake. I had completely the wrong board installed; it could not install without a huge problem.I ended up trying to fix this by using an SSD (SSD and HDD are not compatible at all); this did not work and I had to return the system. I have since returned to the Z87-Deluxe and use it with Haswell for now, but it will be replaced again in the near future.If you want to know the most important things to look for in a new board, please read what I said about Haswell. If you want to see the most important things for a new Haswell board, also check out the Skylake-X page. Note that both the
PALMETES — The City of Palms is in the process of selling off 2.8 acres of land that could eventually be developed into a $2.8 million retirement village at the former Palm National Freeway.The city announced Tuesday that it is selling the property in the town of Palms on the north and south banks of the Palms River, between Interstate 85 and the Palm-Dixon interchange.The city is giving the property to the state Department of Transportation and a real estate broker, which is preparing the property for sale under conditional use permits that will allow it to be used for up to three years as a planned community.If completed, the project would consist of a three-story brick and concrete building with town and fire department offices and four or five residential units."We are happy to see the city work with us and see the community get involved in making it happen," Scott Jones, city director of planning and development, told the Palm Beach Post.The property is one of 15 parcels the city is selling or giving up this year, one of the largest, according to Jones. He said the city has an "obligation to manage this kind of property" and the seller is "doing some very important work to make this property a successful community."The first sale of the parcels is scheduled for May and will bring in between $40,000-$60,000, Jones said.The city also recently sold a parcel in the city limits that was designated as a senior village and received $100,000 from the state.That parcel, which stretches along Palms Road between Palm Beach Lakes Road and I-10, is home to a retirement village called Palmatos. That village was built on an abandoned portion of the former Palms Freeway property in 2012, with assistance from the federal government and the California Department of Aging. It is located at 5300 Palma Road."It's a place you can go to find community and where you can get a sense of community and get a sense of the community as opposed to all the businesses and the stores and so forth," Palms City Manager Larry Coughlin said. "It's an opportunity for people to come together, eat, shop, socialize and enjoy life."Palm Beach County has been working to sell off land that has been developed in cities, towns and counties in a bid to save money. The county was also working with the state to sell off a former U.S. Postal Service post office property in Palm Coast. In Palm Beach County only part of the former Palm National is being sold and the city is planning to use the money to build and maintain an active park on the remaining property. The city also would like to develop the county-owned, 12-acre lot at the intersection of the two highways that was formerly the Palms Expressway."We want to do this. It helps us out," Palm Coast Mayor Douglas A. McLean told the Orlando Sentinel. "We need it for the kids and the seniors and the disabled."
I'm going to say it upfront: You're better off using this recipe for "classic" baked macaroni and cheese and not "cheated" mac and cheese. It would be a totally different dish. It's true that the recipe's original intention is to replicate the traditional cheese sauce for baked mac and cheese, which makes sense. But it still wouldn't give you the traditional mac and cheese crust. Instead, it creates an incredibly thin, crispier-than-normal mac and cheese crust. That, my friends, is cheating.The crust is a very important part of the true, traditional macaroni and cheese. To achieve the perfect crust, you need an extremely thin dough like this one, so you'll want to use a stand mixer to bring it together as well. (If you don't have a stand mixer, just use your hand and a dough lifter.) The dough will rise slightly and become soft and malleable as it cools.Once it's risen, you'll need a large bowl or a measuring cup filled to the line and lined with a kitchen towel or plastic wrap. Line the rim of the bowl with the dough and lift the bowl, gently and constantly, off the table until the dough is cool and pliable — about 45 minutes.Cut the dough with large serrated knife (it should be very, very thin), and toss with milk, salt and pepper. Set it aside for a few minutes, then roll into a ball.Line baking sheet with parchment paper and transfer dough to baking sheet.Bake it in a 350ºF (180ºC) oven, lightly greased and flour-sprayed, for about 45 minutes, until it's golden brown. If a crust forms on the underside, try moving it with a spatula a couple of times during the time it is baking.Meanwhile, mix up your homemade sauce.Melt butter in a small skillet over medium heat. Set aside.Add flour to pan and cook, whisking continuously, 6-8 minutes, until thickened (about a minute, stirring occasionally).Add sour cream and milk and whisk until thickened (about a minute, stirring occasionally). If it's too thick, add a little more milk. If it's too thin, add a bit of sour cream until it is thick enough for you.Add eggs and lemon juice and beat until very smooth (about 1 minute, whisking occasionally).Transfer sauce to a small mixing bowl and add cheese. Make sure there's very little cheese in the sauce, or you may end up with a cheesy sauce. If it's too thick, make a little room in the sauce. If it's too thin, add more sour cream until it is thick enough for you.Deglaze the pan with a splash of white wine.Pour the sauce evenly around the top, so all the cheese is evenly distributed. Sprinkle with parsley.Let it cool, covered, for about 2 hours, or until it's room temperature.When the sauce is at room temperature, remove the parchment or plastic wrap from around the bowl and the cooled mac and cheese.Slice the bowl open to remove the dough. Roll it in a large clean dish towel or with a clean, damp cloth for easy handling. Repeat this process with each of the three bowls, the parchment sheets, and the dish towels/cloths to make your own three-bowl mac and cheese. Wrap the remaining dough in plastic wrap and store it in the fridge for up to 5 days.This recipe was shared at my summer cookbook party.
Raspberry Pi and AndroidAfter using Ubuntu for the last 2 years or so and running a few Ubuntu-based apps like LibreOffice, I've decided to give the Raspberry Pi another chance. It's a tiny piece of hardware, but I like the flexibility it gives me. One of the biggest challenges of moving between platforms was learning the difference between what's called 'applications', or simply called applications, and 'packages'.There's a fair amount of terminology, so I'm going to try a simplified description of what each category means. The goal, I've found, is to be able to keep things together easily without any additional terminology (or, in fact, documentation). Here's what I've got so far:ApplicationsA package is a collection of files that can be used by an application. It consists of the application itself, and any libraries, applications, or packages that are required to run it.Examples: X, Y, etc..The most common format of an application is a .deb (debian package), but you can also use .rpm (RPM package), .tar.gz (tarball), .tar.bz2 (TAR archive), etc..Packages, on the other hand, are packaged for specific devices, usually referred to as 'vendors'. It's worth noting that 'Vendors' are actually a misnomer. There is no vendor, just an application (or packages) that a Vendor has created. Vendors are the people who make a package available for use on the web.When installing a package with the 'apt' command (package manager), the packages that are included are not installed – but rather they are installed using the 'dpkg' (distribution package management) command, or from another package manager (such as YUM)Apps (including applications that are written/created by Raspberry Pi Users) are managed via a web interface, and can be installed easily from a web server, or via the command line. There is no direct way to download and install.Installing software can be difficult/challenging due to the numerous possible ways how the program can be installed.The best solution to the problem of installing software has been developed by Robert O'Callahan and a collection of other contributors: 'Raspberry Pi Software'. The software provides a web based GUI for the distribution of packages through 'apt', along with built-in commands for installing applications in a single command, which is what I call the Linux-first way of doing things.The software is also used by the 'Aduino UNO' or 'Arduino Leonardo' projects.PackagesWhen installing software packages, they are installed as an .rpm or a .tar.gz file. These packages, being software binaries, are binary executables. However, all packages share one property: every package is only available for one release of Ubuntu (or Debian, or whatever the default Debian is) and the packages can always be updated via the 'aptitude' command. There's no need to install the software manually for updates.To download the latest version from the command line, you can do :sudo aptitude updateOr, if you prefer, you can do 'aptitude install' manually, instead.You can also install packages by manually downloading them from their website.You can see a list of Ubuntu releases by typing : 'apt' in the search box in the top bar. You can 'fix' the version of 'apt' that displays by using the '--unfixed' option. For instance, to fix the current version to the version of Ubuntu 12.04, type 'apt --fix' or 'apt --fix-unfixed'.The packages that an installation of this software is made available for use (or if there were any issues during installation) can be discovered using the 'Package Manager' option on the main menu and clicking on the 'Install' button.An example of an 'apk' (application package), a .deb or rpm file, can be seen below (you'll need an .deb file or an rpm file to be able to run it as a terminal application):You can create your own applications with the 'wget' command, which downloads the 'firmware' used for installing the program. A 'wget' command can be followed by one or more files, and then the file name is searched for, and if multiple 'wget' commands are run on the same file, it is the first file that is downloaded, and the others are ignored in favor of the last one. These packages don't need an application server or a web server to be installed to work. They are all packaged for a single release of Ubuntu.You can see a list of releases of the Debian and Ubuntu versions of this software at:
This is not the sort of game you can play in the comfort of your own home without watching a few replays online. I don't pretend to see all the permutations that exist just yet. But I can see some of the potential challenges that could occur with any of these.There are a couple of things that really need to be considered. Firstly, the game is only meant to be playable when played with your opponent's computer. It makes a big difference whether the person playing the game with his/her own computer is able to see the screen or not (unless his/her screen is too dim). It could also affect the timing for certain actions. If you know the other person is not able to see your screen, you could be playing in a way that has the opponent unable to do some actions, since a visual error may have occurred, or that you might have made yourself as a result of having your own screen. In addition, it is not guaranteed that a human opponent will always have the same screen as yours, and as such his/her screen could be a different color or more detailed than yours.I've also always thought that perhaps the opponent might not actually own a mouse! However, this seems extremely unlikely. Mouse games are played all the time on the internet. I'm sure mouse games could be played at any time anywhere at any of the computers in the world. So, it is not that unlikely that the opponent's and the players games could be displayed on different screens as well. One thing to note is that this assumes that the human opponent actually has a display screen at all (and not just that one display screen we've all talked about the other day). This might be a bit beyond the scope of this document, but maybe you can think of something. If it doesn't cross your mind, then let me know and I'll add anything you think is important.Other than these points, it is not a problem. There will be situations as you play where you think you make a wrong move and the opponent notices. This is fine, and you can probably explain how you're not actually right when the opponent makes a mistake as well. For example, if you think you know how to get in range to fire your missile, but your opponent tells you that his missile target is being locked onto something, then you should really fire your missile. Obviously, your opponent will not tell you that for you to shoot the missile you have to take its "target lock" off the screen. But it could be that the missile is "locked on" (i.e., is showing as its target) or is "locked on the missile target", and thus is "unlockable" and not targetable.As a general guideline, think of it as making a move with as little chance for an error as possible, and as much space as possible for your opponent to make an error.Other things to consider:How much information your opponent has. If you are playing by yourself and it is just the two of you, you will probably have an advantage unless your opponent has a high-end graphics card or some special equipment (such as a graphics card or a laptop with a dedicated graphics card). In this case it may not matter so much if the game is played on two screens or on four.If you are playing by yourself and it is just the two of you, you will probably have an advantage unless your opponent has a high-end graphics card or special equipment (such as a graphics card or a laptop with a dedicated graphics card). In this case it may not matter so much if the game is played on two screens or on four. What the other computer does, and the computer's ability to see. If the other computer has special graphics cards to allow it to see things that you do not, it may be able to see that you are making the wrong move, and so you have less time to make a mistake on your own. On the other hand, if the other computer is using some sort of video overlay to show you exactly what the opponent is doing, you may find yourself having to work harder at making an error before your opponent notices.If the other computer has special graphics cards to allow it to see things that you do not, it may be able to see that you are making the wrong move, and so you have less time to make a mistake on your own. On the other hand, if the other computer is using some sort of video overlay to show you exactly what the opponent is doing, you may find yourself having to work harder at making an error before your opponent notices. If it is a live game. If the game is live, the problem of player errors could be slightly mitigated. You could consider getting the other computer to pause or even cut off if it is getting a lot of errors.If the game is live, the problem of player errors could be slightly mitigated. You could consider getting the other computer to
New Zealand's Prime Minister calls for action over rising carbon emissions19 June 2014Prime Minister John Key recently warned climate change could lead to global catastrophe, and promised to take the issue as "very, very seriously". He spoke with The Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF) in his capacity as a senior member of the G20 Council, the 20-member global economic and political grouping that brings together the leaders of the world's largest economies and is based in Washington DC.PM John Key, welcome to Democracy Now! Talk about what climate change means and why we're concerned.JOHN KEY: Well, I'm glad you asked that, because this is a world-leader issue for me. There are several issues that are of concern about climate change; but the way in which I deal with it is that we all have to deal with it and the question is, what can be done to reduce the impact, especially in terms of greenhouse gas emissions and carbon emissions. And we are very serious about doing so.You know, what John said is that it is a huge world-leader issue that we will all have to deal with. It's a huge problem. And the whole world and the whole world—I think John's got a very good point about the whole world having to deal with it.I mean, we've all seen that climate change is affecting the global economy. It's affecting the global natural resources and I think it's going to affect the whole world. Not just New Zealand. We're going to want to take a serious look at that because I think we could be affected by it more than we currently are because of the number of people who would want to travel, you know, because we're a very active part of the region.JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And is there—is the US government involved in any way with your climate efforts? Has the US government expressed any interest in being involved in any kind of policy that could go forward within this conference?JOHN KEY: Well, you know, there are certain conversations that—that can be had. I mean, obviously John's already been talking about this issue. But we have an international conversation about this issue and I haven't asked this, but we have had discussions where, if they have an issue that they'd like to raise with any of the countries, those issues could be raised. That's what the world will do, you know?JUAN GONZÁLEZ: But, John, in terms of what we're looking—what we're looking forward to—what is the world looking forward to?JOHN KEY: Well, you know, obviously, the world is looking forward to seeing what the outcome of the negotiations here will be. And of course, we all look forward to being able to make a much more positive contribution to the negotiations and seeing, you know, the progress of all the different commitments that have been made.What we will be looking forward to finding out about is what's what the commitment is coming from all these countries and we will be looking to find out that and then that will inform what we do and what we can do as part of the G20.AMY GOODMAN: In a news conference following the summit, the prime minister also took aim at China and India, saying, "It's no secret that China and India's aspirations to become big, successful economies has been a factor that has put increasing pressure on the climate."JOHN KEY: You know, and it does put increasing pressure on the climate. That's why it's so important that other countries around the world join together and that we can build those kinds of ambition around the world.AMY GOODMAN: And could you give the specifics of those talks that you just had in Washington?JOHN KEY: Well, I can't—look, you know, as I said earlier in the program, there are all sorts of discussions going on. I've already mentioned the fact that a number of countries are talking about, you know, the need to come to some kind of agreement, you know, what exactly that should be. But there is no doubt that the amount of ambition and the urgency of moving on to this new era of international action that we are talking about, and the fact that China and India are at the forefront of that, there was certainly not one country that showed any interest, you know, being unwilling to move on to this. I mean, there's absolutely no question in my mind that if the talks weren't going well, as I've said, they wouldn't have been brought in the first place.JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Mike Sandiford, just to talk specifically about India, the U.N.'s latest climate assessment report suggests that India's current emissions are not on a par with China and the United States. Now, you
HONOLULU, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Two tourists said a powerful earthquake of magnitude 8.8 struck offshore Hawaii early on Tuesday, and a second quake was being followed by a tsunami warning.The U.S. Geological Survey confirmed the Hawaii quake, which struck at 2:18 a.m. local time (0818 GMT), was a 5.3 tremor. A magnitude-9.0 quake will be felt as far away as the Hawaii County, the USGS said.The initial quake was followed by a 6.2-magnitude aftershock and a tsunami warning was in effect for a 7-foot high wave in the water about 70 miles west of shore.The waves were about 6 to 8 feet high at the time of the first shock, which happened shortly after midnight Hawaii time.The tsunami warning was updated an hour later to an 8-foot swell.USGS says the earthquake was not related to Japan's massive Tsunami.The agency was unable to provide precise locations or details of any damage, but at least one building appeared to have sustained some damage with toppled tiles and cracked glass in several areas of the coastal state."There were a couple of small buildings that were damaged, in the water. But there were no reports that there were any significant houses damaged," said Brian Bumpers, a spokesman for Hawaii County Civil Defense.The USGS said it was possible that some tsunamis could reach the west shore.
"I always use a good razor, not one of those cheap knock-off shavers with a fake handle that's been in the market for years."As it's often mentioned in the comment forums of razorsharp.com, the "fake-handled" razor of shaving forums is really really a fake-shaving handle—and it looks terrible.Some have reported problems with the handle, such as not having enough room between it and the blade and/or the handle being bent, but at least it isn't just the blade that is bent…And here's the thing about the fake-shaver, not everyone uses the same handle length or size. So depending on the handle, it may not actually make any difference whether or not you use the handle correctly.
By Dr. MercolaLung Cancer, one of the most common cancer types in Western countries, is a terrible disease. Despite over 40 years of research, the cause is still a mystery. And it is still spreading, especially among younger adults. About 1 in 4 Americans of all ages, between the ages of 20 and 69, will develop lung cancer over the next 10 years. The good news is that lung cancer can be reversed if detected early. If you are a person taking a statin, there may be a chance that the drugs will help keep your lung cancer at bay. But be aware that taking any type of medication in the midst of other chronic diseases is never good and can actually make the problem worse.Lung Cancer and StatinsLung cancer, or "small cell lung cancer," is defined by the World Cancer Research Fund as a cancer that forms in the small-cell compartment of the lung cell called the alveolar space. There are three basic types of small cell lung cancer, including squamous cell, adenocarcinoma, and adenocarcinomas that are often referred to as "small" cancers. Some forms of lung cancer are caused by lung nodules. Some forms of lung cancer are not caused by a nodule, yet have lung tissue that resembles a nodule.Lung cancer comes in many sizes and shapes—but the most dangerous sort, and the one most often misdiagnosed, are adenocarcinomas, which are the most dangerous forms of lung cancer.Statins May HelpIt is estimated that about 2 million people in the U.S. are taking cholesterol-lowering statins to treat conditions like high cholesterol or high blood pressure. Statins are drugs which your immune system, which is often already weakened by aging, is supposed to remove. Statins affect your body's ability to fight infections, and your heart, which is also weakened by aging, is supposed to control your blood pressure. But statins affect many different areas of your body, and have little to no effect on the larger, more complex areas of the human body. They cause no immediate, lasting harm and may cause your cancer in the future, just because your body does not need it now. This is not surprising, considering that statins are supposed to "trick" your immune system into treating cancer and not otherwise treat it. In fact, statins cause a slight increase in the amount of cancer in the body.For example, studies have shown that statins may make the immune system more likely to fight cancer as well. In fact, some statins, like those taken for high cholesterol, have a slightly raised risk of cancer and may even increase cancer risk in someone who is already at high risk.It has also been shown that taking statins with cancer can lead to an over-prescription. However, in 2011, the National Cancer institute released a special report on statins which concluded, "Some data suggest that use of statins with cancer may be associated with a higher risk of cancer."For example, an analysis by a team of researchers published in June 2011, found that an average of 459 people died from cardiovascular causes every day in the U.S. from 1990 to 2011. These are deaths caused directly, by heart disease, stroke, and heart failure. Statins may be one of the causes of these deaths. However, more research is needed to really determine which types of statins may be responsible for this, as the effects could be mixed depending on the type of statin, how long you take it, and whether or not you have cancer.Statins and Lung CancerThe most common statin used, known as Lipitor, which is a form of methotrexate, was actually originally designed for osteoporosis and other bone conditions. However, over the years, Lipitor has received the highest marks of approval for treating osteoporosis. And the reason for this is that Lipitor works by inhibiting the enzyme mTOR, which controls how much muscle protein, called protein synthesis, takes place and is crucial to maintaining bone density.In fact, mTOR in fact has recently been demonstrated to be involved not only in human muscle strength, but also in the aging process and in many diseases. In the case of lung cancer, mTOR inhibitors have recently also shown promise in slowing down tumor growth.In fact, a meta-analysis published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology in November 2013 analyzed the data from over 12,000 clinical investigations over the past 40 years and found that statins and their combination with chemotherapy, radiation, surgery, and other therapies are effective in decreasing the risk of developing lung cancer by an average of 41 percent. Statins were most effective for lung cancer when they were taken with other drugs commonly used to treat the disease.However, while statins may lower the risk of getting lung cancer, it
A new study examining trends in gun violence in the United States reveals a dramatic increase in gun violence between 2007 and 2014 with the number of deaths caused by firearms nearly doubling.In 2015, there were 33,073 deaths from gun violence in the United States. That number jumped to 58,631 by the end of 2014. The total number of people who had died from gun violence between 2007 and 2014 jumped by a massive 2,639 percent — a rise that was nearly double the average growth of the previous 17 years.Researchers also found that the majority of deaths caused by firearms involved firearms owned by family members rather than criminals.The study is based on data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Vital Statistics System and the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Supplemental Homicide Reports.It was conducted by economists Todd Zywicki, of the University of Missouri-Columbia, and Michael Siegel, now at George Mason University, looking at the trends and causes of firearm deaths from 2007 to 2012.The research, which is yet to be published in a peer-reviewed academic journal, found a high percentage of gun-related deaths — about 66 percent — involved a household weapon like a rifle, shotgun or machine gun. The majority of these deaths — 71 percent — were suicides.Between 2007 and 2012, the death rate for firearms suicides fell by about 10 percent, the study found, compared with 5 percent over the previous 17 years.But, the researchers found, there's a major disconnect in how more gun violence is being reported.In 2013 alone, the FBI made a huge surge in firearm deaths by releasing a massive trove of data compiled by gun control activists from private background check databases. The number of firearm deaths rose by 27 percent between 2013 and 2014, according to the NSSO.The surge was fueled by new data showing the dramatic uptick in deaths involving firearms.Still, the researchers note that the increased firearm killings continued as other indicators such as homicide and suicide rates declined.Ziewicki and Siegel also looked at trends in violence overall in the United States as compared to other high-income nations. Their research revealed that the U.S. has experienced an incredible decline in violence involving handguns and assault weapons.Although the United States is unique in many ways, the authors claim that other countries are not immune from violent crime and gun violence.
When I was younger, I would play dress up as characters like Darth Vader or Princess Leia and dress up with dolls that had just had a skin infection. I don't remember seeing a movie that showed this happening and the main female character would get infected in this process. When I got older and started to understand how body fluids work in our bodies, it seemed strange that Princess Leia didn't get an infection like other women. So I was asking myself "do I know anything about biology and medicine?"I've always had an interest in this topic. So a few years ago I decided to look at how much women bleed and what causes them to bleed more or less than men. But it became clear to me that not enough people were really talking about the process of hemorrhage. So I decided to ask the questions that I had been meaning to ask for a long time (and then some!).Why do women often hemorrhage more than men?Many people believe that women are far more likely to bleed than men because they menstruate more. But the truth is many things can cause women to bleed more than men. The main ones are pregnancy, childbirth, and the use of hormonal contraceptives.While it might sound obvious it's true that the menopause, which lasts from the end of menstruation until the menopause, can cause a women (whether menstruating or not) to bleed more than she did in the past. It also may be that in cultures where women don't have this change of period, it doesn't take place.How can a woman get an infection in a place that's normally protected?Women can get an infection in these places due to a number of factors. The most common ones are:When a woman is menstruating, it's harder for her body to regulate fluids because she's not producing as much. When this happens, the vagina can get more susceptible to bacteria such as those found on tampons, sanitary napkins, dental dams and condoms. This could result in some kind of infection.While it's true that condoms and tampons are designed to be absorbent and can help keep liquids in the vagina from spilling out and causing an infection, this should probably be considered when using a condom or tampon.Women are more likely to have an infection at night because they have the least amount of sleep overall. Also, it's common for them to sleep in a way that puts them in what's known as a "tummy prone" position. This means that when lying down, they can pull their lower belly toward their genitals and that puts their upper body in closer proximity to the vagina. This can result in the vagina being more susceptible to getting a urinary tract infection (UTI).If you have UTI and then go to vaginal birth control that contains clindamycin, for example, clindamycin may actually inhibit the bacteria from spreading to other places in the body which may explain why your urine stays dark and no blood is seen when you urinate.What causes a woman to bleed more than a man?The first reason that men can bleed more than women is because their male organs have two types of blood vessels: arterioles and venules. The arteries are blood vessels that supply blood to the blood vessels of the body. They carry oxygen to the heart, muscles, and bones and are also often associated with heart attacks. They can also cause an embolism. The venules are the little capillary-like openings in which blood passes. For some reason, they also can leak blood which can cause an infection.Here are some things that can cause an infection in a man that isn't possible to do in a woman:Having a urinary tract infection , like a cyst or an abscess, like a cyst or an abscess PregnancyHormonal contraception and pregnancyHaving a sexually transmitted disease like herpesLike with women, some things that will allow some men to bleed more than others include:Having a kidney stone or narrowing of the Ureter , often due to an enlarged prostateor narrowing of the Ureter , often due to an enlarged prostate Birth control pills, especially estrogenlike estrogen Certain types of blood clots , which can occur if there is an underlying bleeding disorder, which can occur if there is an underlying bleeding disorder Steroid medications and overuse injuries, like from football, wrestling, or runningMany others, though, will have an infection, and the infection could be from an internal condition.When a person bleeds more than she should, shouldn't she have a pelvic ultrasound?One of the things that we hear a lot when we talk about menstrual periods is that women aren't taught how to take care of their periods until they're older. So many women have a fear of getting an infection without realizing it. However, the pain or discomfort

When it comes to the big picture, it's a good thing for Apple that it doesn't pay attention to the individual components of our phones. That's a lesson HTC learned when it launched its first smartphone.Apple's iPhone 5 is widely touted as a major milestone this year in the smartphone industry. When it launches Sept. 21 in San Francisco, it will likely be hailed as a major step forward in both design and technology.But the same Apple that takes advantage of its proprietary technologies for its iOS devices has a long history of ignoring its own internal processes. When we review flagship iPhone 5 handsets, we can't help but notice their underwhelming cameras and battery life. In fact, the iPhone 5 will not even beat the Galaxy S III, Apple's flagship phone for many years, as far as camera performance goes. Apple's lack of attention to core technical details has, in the past, cost Apple dearly in the smartphone market.Back in 2011, I reviewed Apple's iPhone 4. When I got my hands on the phone, it had a 6-megapixel camera that offered "excellent picture quality, but not the most exciting features.""The camera was a big point for people, but ultimately a disappointing one," says Scott Stein, an analyst at Oppenheimer & Co.The iPhone 4 came along with iOS 4, which added Siri voice controls, support for new 3G networks and iOS 5.1, an operating system update that added more features.On March 10, 2012, Oppenheimer published a scathing analysis of the iPhone 3GS review because it "takes an overly negative view of the features of the previous generation iPhone."In contrast, HTC is celebrating the release of its One X today. Its One XL is a device that comes in blue, green, cream, red and black colors. Its camera captures a whopping 13.1 megapixels, just shy of the iPhone 5's 13-megapixel sensor. In many ways, HTC seems to be copying the iPhone – its camera, too. HTC's One X is a powerful smartphone, but it isn't as cutting edge as Apple's latest and greatest.When we test, we look for a combination of hardware, software and features that help consumers determine how well smartphones work together.Apple's iPhone is based on a quad-core processor with 3GB of RAM. The iPhone 4 and iPhone 4S were equipped with PowerVR SGX GPUs that helped them render and animate images. Since the iPhone 5 has a dual-core 1.2-GHz chip, it will be running iOS 6.1, which will enable higher performance, more power efficiency and an enhanced camera for low-light shots.HTC, on the other hand, has a more modestly specced One S with 1GB of RAM and an 8-megapixel camera that offers great photos, but it lags behind in overall performance and other areas. According to Oppenheimer, "We'll need to see more of HTC's S4 smartphone to get a definite sense on how well it compares to Apple's latest."At the same time, HTC's One X has a 1.4-GHz dual-core processor and a 1.2-megapixel camera that provides a wide field of view, which is a huge plus when comparing images. Samsung's Galaxy S III can run Android 4.0.4 Ice Cream Sandwich and features a Snapdragon S4 chip that has 4GB of RAM and 32GB of storage, while Apple's iPhone 5 will have only 4GB of RAM and 16GB of storage.On Aug. 29, Oppenheimer predicted that Apple's iPhone 5 will sell 2.5 million units at launch. That prediction turned out to be spot-on."All the major wireless carriers are going to announce the iPhone 5 in major retail stores in the next 24 hours," said Chris Weber, industry analyst at Gartner.A spokesman from HTC confirmed that HTC is planning to launch the One X by the end of the month as well.Our iPhone review for the iPhone 5 will appear later this summer.
What if Hillary Clinton made an appeal to Bernie Sanders voters to vote for Hillary Clinton in hopes of getting Clinton through the nomination vote threshold of 2,383?With less than 100 days until the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, the Vermont senator's supporters have been pushing Bernie to rally his base and push for a "safe" Democratic nominee over presumptive nominee Hillary Clinton.Clinton's opponents have begun making overtures to the Vermont senator's backers in an effort to woo Sanders supporters to their side.Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton told reporters at a campaign stop on July 17 that she's "not going to run to be president. I am running to earn the votes of Democrats, and I feel that it is important to earn the support of voters across the country." (Video: Reuters / Photo: J. Scott Applewhite/AP Images)That Clinton's primary opponent, Bernie Sanders, would make an appeal to his own supporters is an extremely unusual thing for a presidential front-runner in modern presidential politics.In 1968, John F. Kennedy tried to win the support of his own backers — mostly southern Democrats — whom he believed would not vote for Robert F. Kennedy if he beat Vice President Hubert Humphrey in the 1960 election."If we are going to make a real difference, we have got to win the White House. And I intend to do everything I can to earn the votes of Democrats, and do everything I can to make sure that Donald Trump is the Republican nominee. That will enable Democrats to gain a majority in the Senate, increase the chances of a woman on the Supreme Court and win major changes in our country, including a progressive tax program," Kennedy told the New Hampshire Democratic Party on June 11, 1968.The "real difference" that Kennedy spoke of at the time was the prospect of losing to Nixon.In 2012, former GOP presidential hopeful Mitt Romney tried the same tactic with the Republican Party's base. He told conservative talk radio host Hugh Hewitt that the GOP base would back the Republican ticket under any Republican president, Romney included."I believe this and I know I'll be proved wrong, but I also believe this: This is a grassroots campaign. And I know that we're going to win. But I know that, just as importantly, we're going to win without the help of a few billionaire donors who have not given us a million votes in the last four years. So I think it's a message that's resonating with a good number of people," he said.This is different. It is far less of a grassroots effort. And it's an effort that has not been successful.A Politico/Morning Consult poll this week found that only 44 percent of all Democratic primary voters said they support Clinton even if Sanders were nominated.In contrast, Clinton's supporters still want to see Bernie Sanders in the White House, according to a Politico/Morning Consult poll from last month. Fifty-four percent of those surveyed said they would back Hillary Clinton even if Sanders was chosen as the Democratic nominee.Sanders' presidential campaign hasn't done a good job of convincing its supporters and other voters to flock to Hillary Clinton. The Sanders campaign will need to do a better job of doing the opposite.On the night of June 7, when Sanders was in California campaigning, Clinton and Vice President Joe Biden made an unscheduled joint appearance. At around 8 p.m., a supporter on the video feed from the event — who was filming — was able to take a selfie with Biden. That supporter was able to capture a portion of the encounter, which lasted approximately five seconds.And even though the campaign of the democratic socialist Bernie Sanders was in California campaigning on June 7, 2016, one of his campaign supporters got a selfie with Vice President Joe Biden. (Photo: Screen grab/YouTube)The selfie was posted on YouTube, where the video has been viewed nearly 17,000 times.Biden's press secretary, Kendra Barkoff, told the Washington Post about the encounter, "It was a photo opportunity for the campaign, there was no interaction, all was normal."Sanders also was at the event for some time but did not participate in the interaction, which is not unusual due to the nature of campaigning.Still, the encounter comes at a time when the Clinton campaign has stepped up pressure on Sanders to unite his supporters behind the Democratic nominee.As part of its outreach to Sanders supporters, the Clinton campaign dispatched campaign manager Robby Mook to meet with the senator's delegates at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia."The secretary would like to see her supporters have a unified focus going into November," Mook said before the meeting on June 9.Mook stressed to the delegates the importance of unifying under the common goal of defeating Donald Trump and electing Hillary Clinton president, in which he said the campaign is "committed to win" the general election.
SALT LAKE CITY — A Utah police chief apologized Monday after he said he would stop the use of taser guns on suspects under arrest or suspected of felony crimes to prevent injuries to civilians."I apologize for any offense caused by my statements, and I recognize they may have been insensitive and insensitive to persons of faith," Salt Lake Police Chief Chris Burbank said in a statement.On Monday, after an outcry from minority groups, the Salt Lake City Council, in response to a public records request from KUTV-TV, requested that Burbank provide "any prior complaints, incidents or use of force by the Salt Lake City Police Department."It was the first time the city had filed a Freedom of Information Act request related to taser reports, but a Salt Lake Tribune reporter found the number of incident reports, including deaths, has increased from 22 in 2008 to 58 in 2013.At least three people have died in tasers as a result of being shocked with a dischargeable weapon with too wide an angle, according to statistics obtained as part of the request, though Burbank said he believes those people were trying to hurt themselves."Any taser is dangerous and you can harm yourself or others very seriously, including the person who delivered the shot with the weapon," Burbank told the Salt Lake Tribune Monday. He added "that includes when people are handcuffed."He added, "The (taser) weapon is a great tool for the police force. Some of the things we have to do are, we have to make sure we are using tasers appropriately."Councilwoman Jackie Biskupski said she was shocked by Burbank's use of the term "unnecessary" in an interview in August before his comments were made public."The use of excessive force and the use of tasers — that is the reason I have been a proponent for a ban on taser use by police officers for the last 30 years," she said Monday.She continued, however, "I find Chris' apology less than adequate."The police chief said he has "heard a lot of concerns from civil rights groups, including people of faith, especially Catholics and other Christian denominations."Though the council ordered a review into the taser deployment policies, Burbank said he does not believe police use of the weapon in Utah is racially sensitive since only two of the eight officers involved are black. He called that "unfair."The issue of racial profiling and police use of tasers was one of the subjects of an August police department training session that was widely panned by department officials, the Salt Lake City Commission on Community and Police Relations and others. A former Salt Lake City police officer said the police chief failed to explain that police have their own discretion when determining to use taser guns on suspects and should be held accountable if police use the device improperly."It is important that we understand this," Burbank told KUTV during an April 23 news conference, when he apologized several times for his statements and asked for forgiveness. "We have not been here very long, but we are learning."City Councilwoman Amy Murray said she still doesn't "get why we are even talking about it."Mayor Jackie Biskupski called the chief's comments offensive and "inappropriate."Mayor Jackie Biskupski said she doesn't see race as a factor in whether police officers use tasers and she believes racial profiling will not be solved unless police are held accountable.Councilwoman Jackie Biskupski said she still doesn't "get why we are even talking about it."While Salt Lake doesn't have a racial profiling policy, Burbank said department members look at a variety of factors in deciding if to use a taser, which include factors such as whether a person has a weapon, whether the suspect is handcuffed and other factors. He added the department doesn't use tasers against everyone who has a weapon or on all people who are handcuffed."A lot of times what police officers are dealing with, they are encountering with resistance and there is a reasonable belief that force is used in a violent situation," Burbank said. "I don't feel like we use that level of force." The chief said that although he believes in the necessity of tasers, he doesn't agree that they should be a "weapon of last resort."Councilwoman Jackie Biskupski said she was shocked by the chief's statements. While she believes police officers should be held accountable for excessive use of force, she said, "How do we build trust when we make racist statements that reflect our own prejudice and ignorance?"The Salt Lake City Police Department has had taser use in recent years as part of its crime fighting strategy. The department uses the weapon on more than half of arrestees, and police officers carry the weapon when responding to domestic violence incidents.During the August training, several Salt Lake City officers
With all the talk about the "new" New England offense, the one thing that hasn't changed is the need for Tom Brady to prove that he can be a game-changing player. When Brady gets off to slow starts in games against defenses, there's a good chance we're going to see the Patriots fall off the table.The first half performance by the Denver Broncos in the season opener was very discouraging, and it was very encouraging that the Patriots managed to hold on to their 24-21 lead while Brady threw four touchdowns.Unfortunately, Brady didn't come through on his half of the promise that it looked like he may have during the first half. He looked rushed out of the pocket, and was inaccurate when it counted the most.One of the problems with the Patriots offense to start the season has been that they haven't had enough playmakers to pick up short yardage and third down. If the Patriots could replace those voids with someone who is capable of creating mismatches, the offense would really be a whole lot better. And, with Rob Gronkowski and Julian Edelman still sidelined, it seems that that's exactly where the Patriots are headed next week as they travel to face the New Orleans Saints.While we can't truly evaluate what Tom Brady will be able to do on Sunday just yet, we can see this play on tape. This is not a complete GIF because it isn't quite complete, but give it a look anyway.Here, Brady is covered by a four man blitz. In the second frame, he throws the ball too wide. The problem with it, though, is that Edelman has split the right side of the defense to the left, and is running directly to where he is covered. He doesn't even see the blitz. The Patriots defense is playing zone coverage here, but Brady takes an easy sack. Brady is just looking for an open target here. Instead, it looks like he's just trying to find a "safe" throw against the coverage.It will be interesting to see what Brady has to say when he puts the game tape on tape on Monday. He will obviously be asked about the offensive line and the run game. However, he should also be asked about his struggles on Sunday. The Patriots offense will have to do much better than this in order to win a game.
The best way to describe The Redeemer would be: "Goth punk rock done in space."That's a pretty good description of the San Francisco band's latest release, "Drown The Ship." The album has some great stuff here—the chunky synthpop of opener "Drown," in particular, has great songs—but, more than anything, it's a solid demonstration of how far The Redeemer has come since their 2012 debut."Drown The Ship" is a good enough song to get the attention of listeners who haven't even heard of these guys, but they also managed to write a killer follow-up.The Redeemer were able to make something that would have made their previous album so fun not just listenable, but enjoyable."The title of the record represents a sort of redemption, a return to normalcy," wrote frontman and guitarist Aaron Gwin. "With this second effort we've been able to reclaim a bit of what it means to be truly 'an American band' as a means of reflecting our own personal struggles in dealing with our political realities."The title is also connected to a very powerful lyric from one of the songs, a song that, when we recorded it, we were inspired to add lyrics after that initial conversation in the recording studio and after some of the songs had been written. I am particularly proud to have contributed to both of these lyrical endeavors. I am humbled to call myself a "redemption singer"—an artist who is passionate about his/her artistry."Having said that, the fact that we have been able to create that much meaning in a little over a year of our work, which is less than half of what the other guys who composed and engineered it took to complete their own works, is a testament to their own writing and recording abilities. We've been able to build an actual community of musicians, all of whom came together to make this record. It's become something far bigger than our personal creative work with the band; it's just a lot of fun to put out music. It's a lot of community at work."Aaron Gwin talks about recording The Redeemer's "Drown The Ship: The Original Album"The Redeemer played the second song off the album at the 2017 South By Southwest in Austin, TX, and they've been touring the album pretty regularly of late. The album follows their acclaimed 2015 record, Dead Rhetoric, and it's available for pre-order here.
The latest version of Firefox for Windows, Mac and Linux is coming soon, and Firefox 25 will bring many enhancements to browsers, including the ability to display the latest Android 4.4 browser in Windows.Firefox for Android 4.4 will be released by the end of this year, which isn't too far off and could be the new Firefox on Android, though that may be in the works before. Firefox for Android 4.4 will have some key improvements, including "new web-based capabilities, enhancements to the user experience and an overall more fluid and faster browsing experience across the breadth of Android supported devices" according to Mozilla.When it comes to Firefox 24, which is the best-selling browser for Windows 10, Mozilla was quite candid in their assessment of the browser's performance. A couple weeks ago, they gave away some performance data for Windows and Linux for Firefox 24 and it seems they are also now revealing a new analysis of Firefox 25 performance in Windows 10. In Mozilla's latest report, they found "significant improvement" in the Firefox 25 Windows 10 browser after several months of testing on the desktop.For Windows 10, Firefox 25 has been optimized for the device hardware and has the newest APIs and features for the Metro UI. It also has faster JavaScript performance and HTML5 features such as advanced animation and the ability to use an HTML5 browser without plugins. There is a new tab page on the start/launch page that allows users to easily start a new tab, find what they're looking for with "frequent suggestions and suggestions in a sidebar." Firefox 25 also adds a new tab page, new search, a new address bar, tab synchronization, a new tab page in the address bar, search suggestions, and improved support for offline access and the new tab page. Mozilla said "significant improvements" in Firefox 25 make it easier to search with voice and with speech recognition. The new tab page in Windows 10 has a "more intuitive, simple design that makes searching with voice easy."Mozilla also found that Firefox 25 has the fastest JavaScript performance (50% faster), the best graphics performance (43% faster), the best webGL performance (38% faster), the best browser security performance (35% faster), the best browser performance for viewing images (33% faster) and the best browser performance for reading web pages (35% faster). Firefox 25 also has a new tab page and tab synchronization for Windows 10 users, and improved Firefox 24 performance for websites that use Web Animations as a fallback option.If you do have Windows 10 running on your PC, Firefox 25 is "now available for testing" in the download section (for all versions of Windows 10 except Home) on Mozilla.com. It may be available soon depending on the test results.via Mozilla Blog
The National Rifle Association is hoping to do for gun safety activists what it's done for gun owners in general: put its money where its mouth is.On Thursday, in Washington, D.C., the NRA announced plans to spend $500,000 this year on gun safety advocates and nonprofits focused on the issue.According to the Washington Times, the NRA will spend some $20 million of that amount on lobbying and advertising in 2013, an increase from 2012's $20 million.Although the group didn't elaborate about which groups it plans to target for support, a New York Times account of the conference last week suggests that the focus is on the political left, which the NRA has regularly called anti-gun."We are going after both ends — the people who like being told they can do what they want, but those who think they can't," Chris Cox, the group's executive vice president, told the Times. "And we have a pretty good track record of success with those folks."While some members of Congress have condemned the "gun-free zones" and "gun-free zones go on school grounds" sign-up forms of gun violence, Cox said he hopes the NRA's funding will persuade lawmakers that gun safety isn't such a fringe issue.Follow Stories Like This Get the Monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox."I think there are a number of congressmen who will find this support is genuine," he told the Times.The NRA's funding announcement follows the group's spending of more than $500,000 in support of a Democratic Party bill to require background checks on gun purchases at gun shows and over the Internet.The bill was initially introduced as a response to the December 2012 massacre at Newtown, Conn., by a gunman who used a legally carried Glock pistol to kill 20 children and six adult staff members. The NRA responded by calling for mandatory background checks for all gun sales, saying the bill would "effectively prohibit the sale of legal firearms and ameliorate the danger posed by criminals."

When you offer a loan of funds, you're giving an honest assessment and helping your friend pay down some of the debt.
Anxiety is often described as a "disorder" but a new study shows anxiety could actually be a healthy behavior that helps us function.According to a report published in the Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, anxiety is not a disorder but the body's response to an internal stress.The study found that anxiety is not a disease and that it is actually a healthy stress response with a natural tendency towards relaxation and stress reduction.It is important to point out that although anxiety seems to be a disorder, the body's response to anxiety is actually healthy for the body.According to Dr. Robert Zatorre, a researcher from the University of Montreal and the Montreal Neurological Institute (CNRS) and an author on the study:"When you're facing a lot of stress (such as illness or a stressful situation) the body is going to do a lot of things to help you stay calm: you may have breathing changes, changes in hormones and neurotransmitters in your brain, the release of glucocorticoids in your adrenals (which causes blood pressure to go up, and that's stressful) or you'll increase your heart rate and blood flow to your brain to try and calm it down."Anxiety is more about our response to stress than any negative thoughts. We are simply overwhelmed, and when we feel overwhelmed we panic.This is something that is perfectly normal and necessary in our lives. The body is a delicate system and is constantly being challenged by an environment that's constantly changing. If we did experience more than the normal amount of stress we would suffer from panic attacks at times to get our adrenal system (a small gland that regulates our body's stress response) to control our stress response to avoid a stroke, heart attack or other serious health problem.But when we experience severe anxiety and our bodies react to this stress response by trying to stop it (anxiety and panic attacks), the body is reacting in a helpful way to bring us back to normal.By taking an active role in our own stress-management and being non-cognitively reactive to stress, we can learn to learn to respond to our challenges with ease.When we learn to be happy with ourselves, we not only feel better, we're more likely to maintain a positive mood and less likely to experience stress, anxiety and depression.In the next article (Part 4: Stress-Resistance training) we'll take a closer look at how we can use stress-reduction exercises and mindfulness. For now, let's take a look at this new study.
I do not like being asked for details. I'm afraid that I wouldn't tell you any more. I'll only say this: I enjoy my work, enjoy making music, enjoy making films, it's the whole package of things. I don't think I can do a certain type of music and make a certain sort of film. A friend of mine used to say a musician's most important job is to get their music out to people and he was right. That doesn't mean you can be a good musician and just do that, though. I just think you need to have a real desire to work at something, to have a vision. And I think it takes a certain kind of person to get you up into that headspace and keep you there. I hope that they don't get me out. I don't know any of the answers, but I do believe that I think I'm making good choices and I think that I've got a vision for music and I'm doing it on my own time and budget.

In a series of tweets, the rapper has called his rival a bigot. The rapper tweeted: "I'm gonna take your money nigga - it ain't cool...#notallniggers."While the rapper has also made clear he is not a racist, he insists: "I'm not a racist, but the white folks need to get with that black ass and stop with the hating."The Blackest Minds star, whose real name is Quavo, took part in a Q&A on Jimmy Kimmel Live on Wednesday morning. In the chat, he discussed his upcoming project.In his first interview since Kanye West's late show rant in which he called him a racist, Quavo had nothing but respect for the pop star.Speaking to Kimmel about the backlash to his rant, the rapper said: "I'm not a racist, but the white folks need to get with that black ass and stop with the hating. They need to understand that we grew up together."What I do is I rap about being a black man in the streets," he went on. "That's where the hate lies." "In my music, the love is. If they got a problem with my love, they got a problem with my love. It doesn't matter what colour he is, I don't want his love," he declared. "If you ain't got love, don't give no black love. If you don't want my love, I'm not saying don't have it - I just won't be there for you."When Kimmel later brought up the controversy again, Quavo said: "I understand that people were upset from the whole situation. What I did was, I love Kanye, I love his music. I have every reason in the world to love him."I'm speaking from a place of love."The rapper said he has made the decision not to attend the Yeezus tour but wants to attend the Grammys.Asked whether Kanye should be held responsible for the fact that his comments were interpreted the wrong way, he said: "I would never speak against his music. Why would I say something bad about someone that I'm about to listen to?"I said whatever I said to help [him] get his message out on this life."After the controversy surfaced, Kanye responded to the outburst on Instagram and said "I'm done for the day. Sorry." But he added: "When I was young, these comments never had no meaning to me; they are just a way of life for some people."
In this paper, we consider the problem of how to choose 'the right' data representation for a task where both the time to find the optimal solution and the precision of the solution are in question. One important decision that can improve the precision of the solution is what we call 'decomposability'.The first two sections discuss how to encode the information needed for the task that is relevant to the solution itself, and the third section describes the information needed to find the optimal algorithm.In the paper, we focus on the task of finding a solution to a linear system, rather than general solutions to other linear systems.As noted in the introduction, for each linear system A, where f ( x ) ≠ 0, in a problem with only one solution, f( x ) is a linear combination of the solution and the state, so that f( x ) ≠ 0 iff λ is independent of x. Using the same reasoning as for the general problem of finding a solution to a linear system, we can see that there are only two decisions to make with respect to all these variables: either ignore the error values completely or compress them; or, if these variables are important, compress them further.For each data structure, we give two ways to compress the data and a way to decompress the data. The first method will be the most efficient on each data structure.Consider f and g. If we apply the compression method to f and g, then it must be in both forms:(i) f(x) = ∑ j x j g(x) = [ ∑ i j λ λ j ] – [ ∑ i j λ i ] where λ j = ∀ z i, x j x ∐ j k (i, j) and g(x) = ∑ j x j 2 x j + f(x) + g(x)(ii) f(x) = ∑ z i, x j g(x) = – 1 [ ∑ j k (i, j) x → g i (i, j) − ∑ j j k (i, j) – g j (i, j)] where g i (i, j) = f i (i, j)-∑ i j n g i (i, j)Using this decompression algorithm on the original data, the amount of information required to find the optimal solution can be represented as ∑ z i, x j x i –1. In other words, the amount of decompressed information (decompressed) is exactly the amount of available information for the task of finding the solution.But with regard to this algorithm, the amount of available information required to find the optimal solution can't be represented as ∑ z i, x j x i, because the amount of information required to find the optimal algorithm also depends on the number of solutions. The number of possible approaches is the number of ways of approaching each variable, or the amount of information in the problem. The following equation describes this problem.∑ t j n j t + ½ ∑ j = 2 m q n j = 2 (λ j )j/m q = m qWe call the amount of 'invisible variables' that the optimal algorithm is likely to require (∑ t j n j t + ½) the complexity of the optimal algorithm, and the amount of 'invisible variables' that the optimal algorithm is likely to find (∑ t j n j t + ½) a constant of approximation. For example, if the choice is between two approaches to f(x), and the optimal algorithm is only going to require the first alternative of up to 4 times as much information to complete the algorithm for the 2nd approach, then we can assume the optimal algorithm is going to require the choice between up to 4 times more information for the 2nd problem, and we'll say it costs the minimality of this constant.This problem of finding the best algorithm is an example of the following type of problem. When trying to find a single optimal (i.e. best) algorithm, we often find some other problem that will be hard, because many other algorithms will be hard. For example, consider the problem of finding a perfect coin toss, where one is trying to find the optimal move given some coin values. If there are up to n different moves to make, then a total of m-bit values need to be examined. How many different algorithms will the user be able to find a universal solution for? With an increasing n, the cost of searching for an algorithm increases, as does the chance of finding an algorithm. With m, even if we have n different approaches to each parameter, there will only be one universal algorithm.We do have some general rules of thumb for finding the optimal algorithm. For large n, we can assume the optimal algorithm is
If this week's release of the Census report on Indigenous Australians continues, we will have the third-highest numbers of Indigenous Australians in the world.This is the conclusion of the ABS's latest population projection release.Since 2001 there have been more than 10 million Indigenous Australians added to the population.At the same time, the number of people of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander origin increased by 623,000.This growth has occurred across both states and territories, and is the result of continuing growth due to migration and a continued decline in non-Aboriginal people of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander origin.The growth of Indigenous Australians was more concentrated in Victoria and Queensland:In Victoria there were 23.3% more Indigenous people of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander origin in 2010, than in 2001.Queenslanders added a further 5.9 per cent of the total in 2010, compared with 5.9 per cent in 2001.Of the total increase, 37% resulted from migration from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to other states and territories in NSW, Victoria and Queensland. The remaining 63% was the result of the decrease in Australian-born Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander origin."The number of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people continues to grow because there are also more people of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander origin here in Australia," said Prof Michael D Evans, a co-author of the report."While the number of people of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander origin grew, the migration rate fell over many years due to the increase in the rate of the non-Aboriginal population and the fall in the rate of migration within Australia."As a result, by 2010 there were nearly double the number of people of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander origin in Australia than there had been a decade earlier."The report also shows that in each Australian state and territory, the Indigenous-origin population grew faster than non-Indigenous-origin people between 2001 and 2010.From the Northern Territory, the Indigenous-origin population grew by 17.2% from 6,640 people in 2001 to 7,630 people in 2010.This compared with a 12.8% increase for non-Native people of similar origins from 2,531 to 4,230.The Indigenous-origin population grew in South Australia by 7.6%, Queensland by 3.5%, Northern Territory by 2.7% and Western Australia by 6.6%.Of the 18.3 million people of Indigenous origin living in Australia in 2010, more than 2.5 million lived in the capital cities.In Brisbane, Sydney, Adelaide and Perth, more than one in three people of Indigenous origin lived in the capital city in 2010.Indigenous Australians comprised 2.5% of the total population in New South Wales, nearly 2% in Queensland and over 2% in Victoria.The proportion of Indigenous Australians living in regional areas was particularly high, with 8.3% living in remote areas - an increase of 5.5% since 2001.The ABS said this was mainly due to the increase in the non-Aboriginal population in regions with a high Indigenous population.Despite this, the rate of migration within Australia over the same period remained relatively low, with the percentage of people of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander origin who moved to the capital cities remaining similar to 2001.The percentage of people of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander origin who moved to regional areas increased over this period, particularly from the Northern Territory.The report noted there had been some movement between states in 2010, due to changes to how Indigenous Australians were recorded.
In his first year in office, President Obama is poised to make significant strides in advancing the cause of LGBT equity and inclusion.But while President Obama's LGBT "evolution" has received plenty of attention at this point, the president was already evolving on LGBT issues prior to taking office.Throughout Obama's time in the private sector, Obama has been a supporter of gay rights. He donated to LGBT causes during his 2009 Senate race, he opposed the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), and he made some pro-gay comments leading up to his decision to run in 2008.As a candidate in 2008, Obama explained in an interview that, "I'm a pretty standard Democratic Socialist. But the party I'm affiliated with, as you know, doesn't support gay rights. Now the president is saying he's for gay rights and he has my back. I'm behind the president, period."At a 2004 Democratic debate, Obama stated that if elected president, "I would not only appoint Supreme Court judges who could uphold the right to marriage for same-sex couples, I would make sure that our schools would begin educating our kids about how to respect and uphold our LGBT friends and neighbors."When asked by NBC's Chuck Todd if he felt that same-sex and heterosexual families should be treated the same way, Obama said in 2004:"I would not make a law that said, 'If you love your neighbor, you cannot discriminate in employment or in the public arena against them.' And that's the basic concept I want to stress, that the basic concept that we should be treating all Americans the same way, that we should be providing a set of values in our public policy that goes around the world and is practiced all across this country. I have said, when I become president, in a few weeks, that I'm going to be taking some executive executive actions on behalf of LGBT Americans."A new Politico/Morning Consult survey released earlier this month revealed that Obama received "an 84 percent approval rating from most LGBT people polled" but that only a majority (52 percent) of LGBT respondents approve of Obama's job performance overall.The poll also revealed that Obama's standing among LGBT Americans has fallen since late last month. In early February, Obama received a 77 percent approval rating from LGBT people, but that dropped to 50 percent in the new poll. Obama's job approval among LGBT voters declined from a 52 percent approval rating in late December to 44 percent among LGBT respondents in the February poll.Even so, many LGBT people remain confident that Obama will advance gay rights. In a 2013 Gallup poll, 70 percent of LGBT individuals said Obama would do a better job advancing their rights than President Bush, while only 16 percent said Obama would do a worse job. And the president has a chance to deliver on this promise; just this week, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo issued an executive order that protects transgender people's civil rights and requires employers to allow transgender employees to use the restroom in line with their gender identity.Even so, Obama's support on gay rights has fallen since the very beginning of his presidency. It is also in stark contrast to his predecessor, President George W. Bush. In 2003, only 15 percent of Americans said they thought Bush opposed marriage equality, while a 2011 national Fox News poll revealed that 57 percent of Americans thought Bush approved marriage equality.This is not the first time that Americans have become frustrated with Obama's actions. As the president prepares for his second State of the Union address on Tuesday, Republicans are urging the president to make a statement regarding his evolving position on gay rights.Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., said on ABC's "This Week" Sunday that "we need him to be a leader on marriage equality" after Obama announced support for same-sex marriage last week.
SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — The California medical marijuana industry on Wednesday got a huge boost from a bill signed by Gov. Jerry Brown, with the state expected to spend millions on the first cultivation operations this year.Proposition 64, which took effect on Monday, establishes a framework for licensing growers and establishes the rules for testing and monitoring medical marijuana products.Brown, in a signing ceremony at the California State Capitol, called the initiative a "historic first step" toward helping people with serious or chronic medical conditions get relief. It's his second law passed to ease the restrictions on marijuana for medical use.The medical marijuana industry has grown dramatically in California in recent years, with more than 400,000 patients expected to receive a registry identification card starting in January 2019, up from less than 3,000 in November 2016. The new law allows patients to grow up to six marijuana plants."Our system for medical marijuana has come at great cost," Brown said. "But in the 21st century, we can and must do better. This is a huge step in the right direction."The state's Department of Public Health has awarded growers for cultivation permits for at least three years and expects the first operations to open in coming months. The Department of Food and Agriculture in November awarded licenses to four cultivators who have submitted letters to the state acknowledging their plans.The $1.8 million first $1 million cultivation license, with a $200,000 renewal fee, goes to the California Growers Association-Sacramento Area. The group is led by Charles Grob, whose family owns the Mendocino Premium Nurseries in Yolo County."This is the first of many licenses that will be awarded to our talented, hard-working, licensed growers for the first phase of cultivation and sales operations," Grob said in the signing statement.The Associated Press reported that another $250,000 will go to a $175,000 license to the California Humboldt Growers Association-Humboldt Bay. The Associated Press also reported that the Department of Food and Agriculture awarded a $5.1 million cultivation license to the Humboldt Bay Growers Association in Humboldt County, with a $175,000 renewal.There are more than 50 pending cultivation licenses in Sacramento and at least 30 more in the Sacramento area.The licenses will provide more than 100 growers with a secure, publicly known address and access to equipment and other resources. In the first year, dispensaries that buy and sell medical marijuana will also have access to the cultivation and testing facilities.The licenses were issued to a series of California growers, including two who submitted letters saying they are developing plans for growing the recreational marijuana market.For decades, California's three-tiered medicinal marijuana system has prohibited people with a chronic or debilitating condition from growing or distributing marijuana under state law, which prohibits smoking or other methods of ingestion.The new law calls for patients who have been approved by a physician to use marijuana to treat serious or chronic medical conditions and gives them the ability to grow a limited amount. Patients can use the drug in a vaporizer, oil, edibles or other forms of consumption or possession, while businesses can sell it if they are licensed by the state to do so.The ballot measure says up to 24 of the state's 56 counties could begin to authorize the state's medical marijuana program under regulations set by the Department of Public Health within a year, followed by the state licensing of 10 more counties in 2020.The law creates a $1.9 billion system to regulate and license growers and to provide dispensaries with marijuana. It also sets up a regulatory framework for regulating the industry. A taskforce will study the costs and benefits of the system, including an annual report on the program.Under the new law, the first $40 million is earmarked for establishing a framework for licensing and regulating producers. Another $40 million will be spent on "training and education" for cannabis companies, and the remaining $60 million over the next two years is intended to help growers get licensed.(© Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

"This was my first time at the Puck Palace and although there weren't many people there, I was overwhelmed and impressed when someone recommended the cheese dip. It's a simple recipe for a great dip, but very unique. It also comes with some extra goodies. The first was a nice little gift, for a first time guest, was the original recipe, "Honey Sesame Balls". It had become my most popular recipe, that's for sure. And the second was The Best Homemade Cheesecake I've ever tasted "Fudge Cheesecake". So delicious!"--Dara B., Puck Palace
The new study of how a group of female rats became infertile was a major advance in understanding how a hormone found in the mother-to-be's placenta could affect sexual reproduction. "It really is a breakthrough," said Dr. James M. O'Regan, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Johns Hopkins University who was not involved in the work.The scientists, who published their findings in the journal Fertility and Sterility, are now testing the effect of the hormone, called inhibin and called the human version of the mouse version that they found in the rats, on a new group of young rats. When mice are exposed to the hormone, they typically exhibit sex-specific behavioral symptoms such as increased locomotor activity and mating behavior.It was discovered that female rats exposed only to the hormone were infertile. It's not known exactly why. The next step was to find out why the female rats, which develop eggs through their uterus, developed abnormal uterine bleeding. To test the theory, the researchers exposed the rats to different levels of the hormone by injecting them with it twice a day for five weeks.What they found was that high levels of the hormone blocked ovulation without affecting the ovaries. But the research team was surprised to find that if they removed inhibitors, such as the enzyme inhibin B, from the animals' blood, the high levels of the hormone could return them to reproductive health.Dr. Richard E. Roberts of the National Institutes of Health, who was not involved in the study, said that this research "represents a major breakthrough in understanding the mechanisms by which endocrine disrupting chemicals disrupt the functions of the reproductive system of mammals."It is unclear yet if this is how the same hormone in the environment might also affect human fertility.A previous study in which a group of female mice was exposed to a common pesticide called chlorpyrifos found that the same hormone could have a number of effects on reproduction. This makes it even more important that the effects of the chemical be tested carefully, Dr. Roberts said. He recommended that researchers consider a more comprehensive test of a broad range of common pesticide chemicals.Although a group of European regulators warned last week that a broad range of pesticides could be damaging human health, "it has so far been unclear whether the EU authorities are following this directive," said the study's lead researcher, David L. Barker of the University of Nottingham, in Britain.
The first time he saw me, I was wearing a tight-fitting black blouse and black capris, and I was crying in an aisle at a grocery store. He was in a limo.I was the daughter of a successful businessman. He knew I was a high school sophomore in New Jersey, who'd been adopted by a married woman in the Philippines, and was hoping one day to study abroad in Europe or Asia.The girl I was crying in the aisle with was a teenage girlfriend of my father's. She was white and a cheerleader. She and my father had met in a Catholic church in the Philippines and they dated over the course of the school year. One day, we started dating. At his house in Manahawkin, New Jersey, my father sat me down in the living room and told me I was in the wrong house for a girlfriend. If we were going to get together, I would need to go to school and be a young lady in a proper family.After about five minutes of explaining that I would be going home with a boyfriend, he announced he was putting my girlfriend on speaker phone. He had no qualms talking on the phone to his daughter, not because he was mad at her for something she did, but because he was mad at her for being with someone he disapproved of. As he made clear he was mad at her for her race, she said "that's not true."That's how I came to know my father.My father had long been my hero. He had always been my biggest inspiration and taught me that people could accomplish anything they set their minds to. His story and how he built his business from nothing is both inspiring and hard to believe.But there was something so different about this phone call. It had been five months since my father got out of prison and he wanted nothing more than to see me so badly. He said he was going to take me on a trip that he'd been planning for months. It would take us to Europe. It would be exciting.It was December, my senior year. I had already enrolled in community college in a nearby town. The semester was just getting started, but after months of waiting, I started my semester off with the dream of traveling across the Atlantic Ocean and playing soccer and running track, all while seeing my dad.I didn't know what to think. What if I couldn't do it? What if he had gotten back into trouble again? I had grown up with my father in my life, but I had always known him as a man of many talents. And now, the most important talent, the one that made him a successful businessman and also my father, had been lost, all because of my inability to meet the expectations my father had already set for me.Then I heard his voice on the phone. "Let's go," it said. My whole world fell apart.I went home that night and begged my father to reconsider. I felt as though I had let him down. My father promised me he would talk it over and see what he could do. He even bought me some clothes. But nothing changed. I went back to community college and graduated a year early after two years of hard work and sacrifice. My dad would just call me once every two weeks or so to explain what was happening.I never even knew he lived in New Jersey when he talked to me on the phone. My dad made sure to tell me he came from a wealthy family because he wanted to protect a big chunk of my inheritance. He told me he knew I wasn't exactly a typical high school student because of my white skin and thick hair. I'd heard that all about my dad.I think I knew something wasn't right. That's how it always started with my father. He knew too much.I don't hate my father.When we first got married, I was a year younger than my husband. I was his baby. We had our first daughter, my older sister, when I was just 17, and my parents did everything they could to ensure my daughter got the best education in the world. There were always lots of vacations and vacation homes. They even bought the only car I had ever owned, an expensive but simple Toyota Camry.One day in my late teen years, they decided they'd finally had enough of me, which is weird because they never expected I would ever do anything with my life. They thought I was a wasted woman who was more interested in buying gifts and getting a boyfriend than being happy.The truth is, they didn't expect that I would ever go to college either, that I was going to graduate and I would be an entrepreneur instead of an overworked mom.But I got my degree from New York University and became a marketing executive for a local bank and, later, the CEO of a mobile phone service. My
Honeycomb, from The Wire to The Leftovers , has a long, strange, and complicated history at HBO. The show — based on a book by George Pelecanos and starring David Simon as a former Baltimore detective trying hard to solve the murder of a young man in an apparently normal, safe community — was the brainchild of David Simon's former protégé, Ed Burns, but it lasted just three seasons (plus a five-episode spinoff) before going off the air. Then, a decade and a half later, the show took a strange new turn: As Simon took over as showrunner, it was revealed that one of the books' central characters was, in fact, an African American, a revelation sure to have far-reaching effects on the larger conversation of race in American culture, but one that was perhaps inevitable given Burns's history, a background that was, and remains to this day, one of HBO's greatest creative and business strengths.But in its latest season, which wrapped up last night on HBO, the series introduced a new character, a Latino, that many have viewed as a sort of "white savior." If you haven't seen the series (and you probably haven't), the show is set in a Baltimore police precinct in the nineties; one of the detectives in the group is played by Freddie Highmore, a black actor who went on to star in films like Moonlighting and 12 Years a Slave . He's paired with the other, the Hispanic, played by Peter Serafinowicz, a Chilean-American who's played some pretty interesting roles over the years, including a cop in A Beautiful Mind and The Wire . Their relationship, at the end of an increasingly tense and emotional season, is one of the series' very few scenes in which they and their characters don't have to race-bait.The episode, "Dumb," was originally supposed to be called "Ghetto," with a scene in which Freddie and Peter were driving home together when an SUV pulls up, and a man is sitting in it, reading a newspaper. Freddie asks, "Is he an African-American?" Peter, obviously annoyed, responds, "Yeah, and his face looks like it's been chewed over by feral cats." (That was a riff on the racist comments that had been lobbed toward Serafinowicz's character, Officer Omar Little, in earlier episodes.)A few weeks ago, Peter seemed almost proud of the comment. In a long Q&A on Tumblr, he said he had thought it was funny, adding, "I don't want to say anything to offend anyone." He called his co-star a "mute" and said that "no one ever complains when someone from the ghetto says something racist." When asked about the comment in the Tumblr interview, however, he came off sounding very defensive at first, saying he'd been misquoted and insisting that he never said anything of the kind. (A later post on his Tumblr seems to have removed the quoted remarks.)When I asked him how a Latino can appear on the show now, that's the part of his answer I didn't get. He seemed to be saying that The Wire always had such a cast and so many characters of color, so why can't a Latino star too? That's a reasonable point, but the problem here, as David Simon himself recently told Vanity Fair, is that a Latino cop on television can be offensive to a lot of people. And we all know how well that worked out for Serafinowicz.What's happened to Peter Serafinowicz is far from a new experience for black actors; it's just one instance in which a major American network television drama has a character whose skin color makes people uncomfortable. And while the reaction to Serafinowicz's comments was predictable, they were also a sign of what seems to be a wider, larger problem we're noticing in the new wave of Latino and Puerto Rican actors on television: a problem of perceived appropriation, where Latino and Puerto Rican characters and the way they're perceived onscreen are often perceived as both too "white" and too "black," with audiences questioning the "acceptable" range of who gets to be considered Latino and who doesn't.A good example of this is the role of Javi on ABC's Once Upon a Time, for which actress Laura Benanti has had an incredible year. Javi is described as a "tough" Puerto Rican boy growing up in Boston: an orphan who gets picked on and bullied growing up and a guy who wants to be something with the future ahead of him (he says as much in the final episode of the show's first season).The only thing we know about Javi comes from his best friend, Sebastian, played by Naya Rivera. Sebastian is clearly trying to impress the girl he's with — because he looks nothing like Javi — and Sebastian is a good actor, so that's good enough for us.
Gibney is a former New York Times investigative editor who is working on a movie about the Iraq War.The New York Times is going to be in the crosshairs of the left in the coming weeks -- in a new movie that may change how the public views the newspaper.On Thursday, Rolling Stone announced plans to publish a piece by Ewen MacAskill, an international affairs scholar, that alleges a gang rape at the University of Virginia in which a young woman was identified as a "survivor." The account by Ewan MacAskill is set to run in the magazine's September issue.The decision to publish the story -- which has not been authenticated but was backed by three other sources -- has already triggered strong reactions from the university. Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe immediately issued a statement calling the article "a repugnant attempt to malign and discredit a survivor."In their statement on Thursday, The University of Virginia added: "The publication of these allegations is reprehensible and not representative of our values as a university community ... We will vigorously pursue all available actions to have the story retracted."The Times report, which has been condemned by both the university and a large group of feminist activists, is being seen by some as an effort to discredit claims of sexual assault at the college and tarnish the reputations of the two young men who were found responsible for the assault. Their trial and a separate verdict in April set off an uproar across the country over the way the college handled the case.[A student's alleged rapist will face few repercussions at the University of Virginia]Ewen MacAskill, the former reporter for The Guardian newspaper and who is working on a new book on his tenure at the Times, spoke with The Washington Post about his upcoming essay, why the piece about Virginia Tech was so controversial and what he had to say about his former newspaper and the allegations in the Rolling Stone article. Edited excerpts:The Rollingstone article came out last week and there have been many high-profile demonstrations and media stories since: People's assemblies to oppose Rolling Stone's decision to publish a piece containing an alleged gang rape at a college campus; professors organizing a solidarity event in solidarity with the Virginia Tech survivors; a letter by members of the University of Virginia's chapter of Sigma Phi Epsilon ordering it to disassociate itself from Phi Kappa Psi, which is associated with the University of Virginia; there have been protests at many other campuses and universities around the country. You've been working in this region of the world for quite some time, but this really comes as a surprise. Why would you do it?I'm a pretty passionate essayist and have always done them. I have written three books in recent years that have been extremely successful and that have not gotten to all of their subjects. The one that I've been looking forward to writing this year was this article from Virginia Tech about a rape case there … [The Rolling Stone article] is about this very specific case and the problems of sexual assault in higher education and how to address those concerns. … So if you ask why I'd do it, it's because I have great admiration for the Rolling Stone staff, they are incredibly passionate and thoughtful and brilliant. It was an enormously challenging story to work on and they put their hearts and souls into it. It is one of the most serious questions in our world and the article is well-written. It will take a lot for any journalist to succeed in writing about these things, I was just honored to have an opportunity to do it. I was working in that arena before, but we never have had a story that has come from a very personal place where people are willing to be so open about their experiences. …I was surprised to see how long the debate has lasted and what a wide range of opinions there have been and that there are very different reactions even in the states and around the country. … The debate has taken us to another level. … It's been quite extraordinary.The article was already generating a great deal of attention. You have people on the left and the right who have weighed in, or have come to an understanding about it after reading it, what their reaction was and their concerns about the possible harm to the college's reputation. How did the discussion about what to do with this information come along?It came out of the fact that the article had been released at the same time that we had an investigation about fraternity rape at the University of Virginia that included a very prominent law professor. He was also at the hearing in the case against the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity and he had an opportunity to speak for many of the survivors who were there. … When the article was released, we took it very seriously that this would be a story that could generate a lot of interest. … [The law professor] wrote a letter to Rolling Stone after it was published. He basically said that he felt it was an attempt to discredit or make light
"They are taking advantage of us to come after them," she told the AP. "When I go and get help with anything, I've been told I am not allowed to go to the bathroom.""It's been two weeks of getting hit with this," Lila said. "This is not even fun anymore, not even a break, just an endless parade."She added that she has also been hit with the loss of her income as well as a loss of freedom of movement from her job."The main thing I'm trying to get a hold of is getting me a lawyer and getting an order of protection to do something," Lila added. "I am very worried about this."

A British couple who have been living in Spain's Basque region are due to be deported on Saturday after spending three years here.A British couple who have been living in Spain's Basque region are due to be deported on Saturday after spending three years here.A British couple facing deportation over three years, spent three years here in Basque region - and are due to be deported SaturdayThe couple, both 45, have three young children - an 11-year-old girl and two teenage boys.The father of the girls, who are now 10 and 13, said that they never thought they'd be forced to go home."I think it's the wrong decision. I'd just like to be with my family now and be able to take them back."The husband said he was unable to go back to his home town of Abrigadilla in Spain with the couple because they could not get a job.The wife has been unable to find any work in Basque country because she is not native, he said.The couple fled Britain when they were 16 after being raped by a fellow student and the police called them to identify him.The father of the boys, who are now 10 and 13, said that they never thought they'd be forced to go home."I think it's the wrong decision. I'd just like to be with my family now and be able to take them back."The father of the 11-year-old said: "I am glad they have been deported because I was waiting for a long time for this to happen."I am happy because I could not meet my family for three years."I wish I could come to Britain and see my children and take them back."It is a nightmare to live in Spain. People know that I did not come here for my own welfare."It is the only explanation for my leaving my country."It is very sad and sad to leave a place where I loved it."The Home Office said they are unable to comment on individual cases.They added that it has no discretion on whether to prosecute people once they are in Spain.A spokesman for the couple said he is too scared to talk to anybody and is trying to get hold of his children and wife to try and persuade them to come home.He said: "They don't know the consequences of being deported. It is not a question of whether to deport, it is about what action to take and how to take it after deportation."We feel a little bit sorry for these two people because their children are growing up here and they can't go back to live in their home town for three years to come back."They need time alone with their kids to go through it."The man added that both had gone to school here and are good at English and have travelled a lot.They have worked hard and are trying to start a new life with kids and a new life. That said, their situation is sad."The situation is tough. At night it's so hard to sleep. I am having difficulty falling asleep because of this.

We've all heard the words 'the best is yet to come' – so how does one prepare themselves for the next generation of players in the League of Ireland?With the introduction of the PRO12 this season, this summer has been a big one for the players in the Ireland squad for the first time being thrown straight into the starting line-up.It feels like the best of times for the players.Having signed at the start of the season, and having gone away for preseason, they've all experienced some highs, as well as a few lows. One key feature of the first week back home is the mental strength you need to keep things going.For the likes of Jack McGrath, Jordi Murphy, John Russell, and many more in the squad, getting through that trip was a good opportunity to reflect on some things that they may have been able to put behind them, but in reality still linger.With the Pro12 kicking off later this week, we asked some of the players around the country on what they have had to overcome to get to where they are now, and what lessons they have learned in their short time in the Republic so far.The players were asked to reflect on their best and worst moments in their short time in Ireland so far, as well as their aspirations for the season ahead.Jordi MurphyMy highlights so far this season:Fantastic.I'm back in Europe for the first time since 2014, I'd like to go one better this season. I'm hoping to be there in a Pro12 game by the end of the season.My worst moments so far:The team hasn't played any games, and we were knocked out from the Champions Cup.The team hasn't gone on holiday so we haven't been able to relax, we've been working hard, all this travel, getting used to each other, it's tough to get rid of that.We were knocked out from the European Under-21 Championships in the opening game. The guys weren't rested for that game, so we didn't have any extra time to think about anything, it was a case of 'get the match done and done'I'm really looking forward to this season, I'm trying not to take anything for granted right now, I'm trying not to think too much about last year's results, I think our young guys are a great opportunity for us to come away with one, but our mentality needs to be different to last year's, we haven't got too many wins under our belt, we've got a lot of quality on the pitch, it's up to the players now to come back and build on last year's result.I'm really hungry to be playing regularly during the season, if we can play like we did last year, then we'll have a great chance of achieving what we want to do.John RussellMy highlights so far this season:The guys did not travel well but we had a good game against Leinster this week, we were disappointed but we will learn from that.My worst moments so far:The most recent games we played against Munster and Connacht ended 3-3. We played well in both games but we just couldn't win against Leinster and I know in that position we can take that game and win the second game.We have all come back from the injury crisis after our first year of PRO12 to the Irish team, so we are very confident but we need to play more positive rugby because you will be beaten more often. That being said though we are still top with 12 wins in 12 games so we just need to focus on the wins.I will play as long as I'm fit, I can't get too carried away, but every game I've been in there and I still score tries.Jordi ConnollyMy highlights so far this season:I had a good World Cup in New Zealand, I was in the squad and we won our group stage game.My worst moments so far:The hardest part for me was not having Jack McGrath back with us when we started with the World Cup was to get used to starting with Jack back and we haven't had that for six weeks.It's been tough with two young guys coming in, John Russell's been around for a year, so it will be exciting but it's not really my time to shine unless I'm playing.My long term aim is to make it to the Champions Cup, I would have loved to play in that this year, I thought we played really well against Munster, but we just weren't good enough today to win.Jordi MurphyMy highlights so far this season:Playing my first game against Connacht this week, it feels great
A few weeks ago I was visiting my parents' house in San Diego when my sister texted me that she and her husband were looking to purchase a home, and that they were on the hunt for an interior designer.What made me a little weird is they're both artists!My husband is an interior designer/landscape designer who also does some graphic design, while my sister works in marketing, social media, digital & content and is a creative director.They looked forward to buying a home and were looking to buy one that was "a little more contemporary," meaning they were wanting a design that would complement their modern lifestyle and lifestyle ideas.I thought, wow! That's an amazing match! But as I learned about the process and my sister, my inspiration, I realized this couple is not an average couple. This couple is a couple who takes their interior design seriously, who are super passionate about having a house that is simple but beautiful, and most importantly, who are committed to finding the perfect house for them in the most practical, affordable, and sustainable way. They were determined to choose design that would work with their lifestyle.After spending several hours on several design and architecture websites and research, my sister and her husband became convinced that they were going to purchase an art deco building that was completely modern and affordable, especially considering the current housing prices.The design:Their interior design is all about "a little more contemporary" in both size (very large) and style (modern). The most important part of their home design approach is the use of natural materials in the home; the art deco style home was specifically built to be an efficient home, not only because it features modern amenities and features but it was also designed to be environmentally conscious. The exterior walls are made from two pieces of reclaimed wood, and the second side of the home that faces out towards the ocean and the city was built out of engineered concrete. Both interior and exterior are painted green, and the walls in the home are covered with a thick protective layer of glass and wood, making the home more "private."The home is built up with two towers (actually four) and is made of three levels that are all connected with the same stair case. The first level houses the bedrooms while the second level contains the living space. Although the interior is big and open, the exterior is still very modern.The house itself has a completely modern look, including the use of light, which makes it great as a day home.I can't wait to finally get to try my hand at painting that house!What do you think about modern and efficient interior design? We'd love to hear your thoughts!
In my previous article I discussed the value of the traditional Christian church. I explained this in terms of being a place of home; one that I felt really loved, but also a place where I felt comfortable being "free" – able to grow and change, not tied down to a set schedule. After all, as a Christian it's a privilege to receive free access to God's Word.A year ago, I had the opportunity to make a few changes – a small one, but a couple of big ones – and join a faith tradition I did not identify or fit (yet). I'm not going to lie, it was liberating. I felt that I didn't have to hide my identity or try to fit in as a Christian; I was able to be who I was – a person who believes God saved our lives from sin, and I am living that belief faithfully every day.But there were a few things I didn't know yet about the Christian tradition. Here's what I learned.A Little House on the PrairieAfter I joined a religious tradition like this one – one that seemed so unlike my own – I did ask some of my pastors if I could join for some services, but I was hesitant. But eventually I decided that that was something I was just happy to do.As it turns out, it wasn't long after joining my faith that I started to wonder if there were other churches like this one in the U.S.I had heard and read about "the Little House on the Prairie", but I kept putting it off as unimpressive or lacking. I thought it was something like a cult of personality, something that you had to join in order to truly "come" to. I was even more surprised when I learned of other churches that didn't feel like they fit in with the Little House tradition – that they had started on their own.A few of the churches I found had started a year or so earlier, but I was shocked to learn of more churches that had been around for decades. To add even more to my dismay, I learned that these churches seem to have a lot in common.They tend to have a few core beliefs, but they also tend to be very diverse and do not always agree with every theological position. Perhaps most importantly, they aren't like any one other church in the U.S. – and it's not like they all get along so well.It's hard to tell how good or bad a church is from looking at one website; however, what I can say from what I've read, and what I was able to hear – I would have to say that it isn't as bad as I was taught. That is in part the reason I haven't felt the need to quit.The good news is that these churches aren't all the worst – some churches are great and don't seem to care about their reputation. The bad news is that that's the majority of these churches, too. It's difficult to avoid these churches, even when you know there's a better one. I'm thankful for the church I'm in now, but if one more one pops up in this area I think I'm finished.My Journey to the Big HouseI'm thankful to be a member of a church that I like. I'm also grateful that I find a church, even when it doesn't fit. My journey to the Big House has been long, but I have had some successes along the way.One of the more difficult decisions I've had to make was where I'd like to be when I'm in my early 30′s – and I think many of my neighbors have made the same decision. But for me – it's been a little tougher. I can't imagine starting over with a completely new church at 30, especially as it seems that the older generations of Christians are giving up on smaller churches.I'm grateful for the church I'm in now, even if it has a reputation. One of the most encouraging things though, is that churches in our area don't seem to be giving up, they seem to be still growing. But whether this happens in a decade, or 10 – I don't know; the important thing is that these churches are there for me. I thank God that I found what I did; and that the churches I'm in are strong enough for me to keep going.What are your thoughts on Christian churches in large cities? Have you found the right one for you?
When I first visited San Diego back in the mid 1980's to see my daughter's first day there, I wanted to make it a point to visit every one of the three beaches that had so excited me over the years. Sadly, I have since passed over one of two of these beaches. But for the 20th anniversary of the city, we returned for a visit. And, for the first time, we visited all three (with a little help from the city parks department). In addition to a special look at the beach where my daughter started her beach daydreams, a fun visit to Mission Beach Park, and a trip to the historic Lighthouse for a look at one of the original lighthouses, we also visited some of the sites that are now abandoned, and were able to visit a few of the city's great historic sites along the way. And for that I hope to receive some credit somewhere for my efforts.My daughter didn't exactly grow up "touristy," as she calls it. She did experience a few summers in San Diego, and even as a child thought that San Diego was "The Best!"My son doesn't even like the beach, but has come to consider San Diego our "big city." So when my oldest visited her first beach in San Diego in the 1980's, I thought she will be very appreciative! She's only grown up since then. So, if you're going to bring a kid to that beach, please do so on the right day of the year, and in the right season.But, when I recently was in town to enjoy a couple weeks of my son's high school career at San Diego State University, I found that one of my nephew's friends was going to be visiting and would be visiting all three beaches the same day, the same day they were all opened!So, I decided to make it a point to visit the beach where he'd be staying on his visit, Mission Beach Park.The following photo essay is the result of a weekend that my nephew and I visited both the beach that our nephew had visited before (Mission Beach, and where a number of the buildings from the Spanish Colonial era are located), and the city park that it now is.From the beginning of August to the end of the month of September, Mission Beach Park was not in actual use by anyone (other than the occasional group of school children, joggers, or some curious dogs). But, it was clear that it was only several weeks before it would be full of people again, and so a number of the buildings were in various stages of re-opening (and, in our case, we took the chance to visit these too).It is always a huge challenge for a photographer to capture, in a photograph, the dynamic range of a location. But my nephew and I were able to capture a fairly good representation of the landscape in Mission Beach Park, the view on the beach where our nephew was visiting, and the buildings that were being opened up (I think all of the buildings being opened were about two stories tall. Many of them had a roof, which did help us capture that natural-looking ocean view. However, since we were in the shadow of the parking structure that we had to visit in order to see the beach, most of the buildings were either dark or dark tinted).We were also able to visit Lighthouse Point Park, and Mission Bay Park, which served as a beautiful backdrop for our photos. The sunsets were spectacular. The area was covered in sea grass and various beach animals. And all of the buildings being opened (the old Mission High School, the former San Diego Museum of Art, the San Diego County Building, and the old Mission High School Stadium) were in great shape (a few had had minor paint work in places over the years).I've posted about all three of these sites here. If you are interested in following some of our more detailed shots of these buildings, you can follow us on Facebook.And, if you want to see more images that I took at Mission Beach Park on Sunday, August 20, visit our Facebook page.Also, please check out our sister site, The California State Archives here.
The following is a transcription of Dr. Fung's video from the National Vaccine Information Center's webinar: "What You Can Do: Stop the Vaccine Epidemic."Dr. Richard Fung: This is the second hour, and I'm here with John Cook, who will be sharing his views on vaccines, which are absolutely shocking.So let me start with some background information, which I think is very important. What are you concerned about—and you can go to this link to get the details—what are you concerned about?John Cook: I'm concerned in general that we're not being told the truth about vaccines. We're told that there's no reason behind what we're being told, so therefore it's completely safe. I mean, there was a study. This is a paper that was done, it looks like, probably last decade or so, to look at whether or not the MMR vaccine was linked to autism. The results of this paper were extremely shocking. The paper found, I believe, that the MMR vaccine caused an autism-like syndrome in children. The paper also noted that, "This finding warrants further investigation considering the possible biological mechanisms for such disorders." They didn't say it was caused by anything, but it's safe to say it was linked to autistic-like symptoms.Let me give you an example from my personal experience with this. It went as follows: I was working in a small city. It's in California, about an hour and a half from Los Angeles. It's kind of small. I was working at a daycare, and I used to take care of about 20 kids that were there, all of whom were children who needed to attend school—maybe about 10 of them are still there. And so I'd go, get in the car and I'd leave and the kids—every day, at about 8:15 a.m., kids were in the school for their classes, and there was one, and this one was not a child who needed to go to school. This one just used to sit there.And so I used to take this one, and I'd get in the car, and I'd leave the school and I'd walk down the street. And I would just see this one kid sitting there. And so all I would see on this kid was these squinty eyes, and the other kids and the adults were—they were just completely fascinated with this one kid, who just looked completely normal. And it was obvious to everybody that this kid didn't need any help. So every time there was a question about whether or not this family wanted to go to the hospital because this kid wasn't going to be able to go back to school, and who is going to take the kid to the hospital—I mean, it was obvious. You know, that kid was just completely normal.And one day, this kid was sitting there and I turned around and saw the first of these nurses come running down and were all, "Oh, no, no, we need to go talk to that kid, because that's actually a child who needs attention, we need to get that child some attention." And I mean, I felt so horrified for that child because he's just sitting there, completely perfectly normal. And what I thought if that family wasn't allowed to go to the hospital to talk to this kid and to get some attention for that kid. My reaction was, you know, this is absolutely crazy. How are we going to teach kids about vaccines when we're making it impossible for them to do something as simple as, you know, get vaccinated?Dr. Fung: That is so horrific. And so it's also important to understand that the MMR vaccine is one of the few vaccines that we have available in the industrialized nations. In our country, when you go to a doctor, most doctors know what MMR vaccine is. And when you ask people what else to get, for example, for their kids, there's lots of different vaccines. We have a lot of other choices for those families. But the MMR vaccine is the one vaccine that—I believe, one of them is the only vaccine that is needed by children under about five years of age. And so when we're thinking about vaccine policy, we often have to say, "Well, in our country, we can't provide all these other vaccines for these other kids."There is a lot that needs to be done, but I want to talk about the issue briefly. But one of the things that is really troubling about this measles outbreak, in my opinion, is that I think this vaccine, the MMR vaccine is very important to have in our culture, in our society, in our families. And it's important not only as a public health measure, but also as an educational strategy. When you get on that plane, you know, you think about what you're about to experience. You have a lot of things that

It would be easy to look at the way the Chicago Bears are doing a little differently this season and conclude their offense has regressed. The numbers don't back it up.Chicago ranked first in total plays and first in time of possession in 2015. The 2016 Bears rank in the middle of the pack in both categories. Chicago is in first in total yards and has the third-most rushing touchdowns this season.This is hardly a surprise. Quarterback Jay Cutler has been very efficient. The offense is still as well-oiled up as it was a year ago.And it all starts when their receivers catch the football. It has been a season of big games for wide receivers, and this has been one of the more notable.The Bears rank seventh in passing yards per game (232.4) and seventh in passing touchdowns (13).No, Chicago isn't the deep threat they were in the days when they had Brandon Marshall, Alshon Jeffery and Kevin White to throw to. But the players around them have still put the ball in great play for the most part.That comes from players who are all around Cutler.Alshon Jeffery will get the credit the most because of his play. He has hauled in six touchdown passes and is eighth in receiving yards with 1,041. That's the most receiving yards Jeffery has had in an entire season for the Bears.But there are more than a half dozen key offensive contributors with more than 1,000 yards receiving that are responsible for the offensive growth. The Bears are in the top eight in passing touchdowns, total points scored and rushing touchdowns.All are important to the team success."I thought Alshon was really good this past year, that's for sure," coach John Fox said of WR20. "I know the way everybody plays around him, I've seen how he's been a big part of the team."Jeffery was asked if he feels he can be an elite player again."I'm just focusing on working on areas of my game that I can improve on, because there's a lot of good things about Alshon, but there's also a lot of flaws in what he does," Jeffery told reporters at training camp. "When you put two stars on one side and a lot of flaws on the other side, when that happens, things aren't going to look so good."Jeffery is the key to the offense overall because when he drops into coverage, the Bears can open things up with run plays out of "12." The two tight ends have proven to be a double-threat.This week, they have been even more formidable with the return of Martellus Bennett. A year ago Bennett was lost for the season in the preseason with a calf injury.So far this season the Bears have had both Jeffery and Bennett in the lineup for at least two plays each."I was surprised at how fast he came back," Bennett said. "He's a quick healer, so a lot of teams were concerned about him because he came back in as soon as he could and played every single snap. So I had no reason to doubt him. And he came back and played great and started all 16 games, he had a phenomenal year. So I knew he was going to be up and down, but it hasn't been that way."The Bears are hoping Bennett's presence in the slot allows Jeffery to stay hot for another year.Jeffery, however, sees some flaws."I feel like he can do more," Jeffery said. "So if I want to work on anything, I'm always going to work out here. I'm always going to work out on the field. So I'm always going to do those extra things, but I feel like he can get a lot better. The thing with Alshon Jeffery is that there are a lot of things he's doing right. There's a lot of things he's doing wrong. The things he's doing perfect are those little plays he makes on the end of routes, those little things in the backfield when they're in the box. That's all, that's all his strengths are. They're his great strengths and all they're going to be. He's got a lot of areas in which they're going to get a great deal better. That's why I'm trying my best to make sure I can be a leader for him."It's hard to tell how much of Jay Butler's success has to do with him on the field and how much has to do with the receivers on it. In 2015, Butler only played in 10 games because of injuries.Last year, he played in 16 and recorded 61 receptions for 966 yards.And last year with Kevin White out, Butler was a little more than a full-time player, but played 15
A large, three-day event organized by the Center for Economic Justice will offer a wide range of programs on the need to shift economic policies away from a focus on the economy's short-term gain at the expense of long-term sustainability and growth. It will bring people from the public, private and non-profit sectors together, with an emphasis on the issues facing the working poor and workers. This event is co-sponsored by the Economic Justice Campaign at The University of Chicago, Chicago Economic Forum and The Economic Policy Institute. The CEEJ will be held on August 23-26th.About the Center for Economic JusticeThe Center for Economic Justice (CEJ) is an independent, non-partisan, non-profit organization founded in 1993 by two Chicago residents, Elizabeth Anderson, a research analyst for the American Economic Association and William Lester, a Ph.D. candidate in economics at the University of California at Berkeley. CEJ's mission is to increase public awareness of how inequality is destroying the American society, and develop a program of analysis and policy that will help reverse that destructive trend.About the Economic Policy Institute (EPI)The Economic Policy Institute (EPI), based in Washington, D.C., is a non-partisan, non-profit, tax-exempt educational and research organization focusing on the full array of economic, political, and social issues facing the United States. Established in 1969, EPI is the oldest of a number of economic centers founded through the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), which set maximum wages and other standards for employees in the United States. Other EPI affiliates include the Center for Economic and Policy Research (CEPR), the Economic Policy Institute (EPI), and the Center for International Development (CID). EPI was the first and currently the only national think tank devoted specifically to educating the public, members of Congress, and regulatory agencies about social and economic policy issues.Follow us on Facebook or Twitter for the latest news and updates on this event.
The US, as a democracy, has done very well in the last ten years. Since 2000, we've reduced poverty by a fifth, halved the poverty rate, saved more than a trillion dollars, and put more than four million people to work. We've increased the middle class, created more opportunity for women in the workplace, and made huge investments in education, energy, and health care. This is true even though we've spent trillions more than our adversaries.But inequality is growing and it's a problem that needs a solution: to shrink that gap and to build a future in which everyone can share in the American dream.That's why President Obama has called on Congress and the states to take action on three crucial issues: education, transportation infrastructure, and the affordability of health care. On every front, we have to do better. And right now, we need Congress to give us the resources to do it.For nearly thirty years, Republicans have turned their backs on these basic federal programs. They've blocked funding for early education and childcare, for universal pre-school and Head Start, and for the Affordable Care Act. And to take it even further, they've refused to pay for basic services like highway work and school maintenance.On education, we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of any high-income country in the world. According to a new report, we also have the smallest percentage of our children graduating from high school ready for college. Yet for the past six years Congress has refused to raise new revenue to ensure we keep funding and strengthening our educational institutions.Unfortunately, the cuts to education, particularly at the state and local levels, are already having very real impacts on our children's school performance and the future economy. A national study by the Education Trust shows that spending cuts in the first two years of a new national teacher pay scale increased the number of years of experience needed before becoming a teacher by six months. It increased the number of years of experience by more than five months for first-time teachers, almost ten months for students who've been working on a teacher preparation program, and more than ten months for veteran teachers. In Ohio, the number of months needed to become a school counselor rose by nearly a year after the cuts kicked in, and by four months for first-time students preparing to become school counselors.The cuts to education don't stop there, though. Because of the way the federal government allocates funds among different education programs, states are also dealing with significant reductions in funding for public schools. As of June 30 the states lost $7.7 billion in federal education funding for the 2012 state budget year. At the national level, we're losing more than 100,000 community college jobs because of the sequester. And because we don't allocate federal dollars fairly, the budget sequester also means that our kids lose out on $3.5 billion in federal dollars for higher education.So Congress has a choice: it can choose to give states and schools the resources they need to fix the problems with education and invest in the future; or it can choose to put even more of our tax dollars into the pockets of our wealthiest people at the expense of our children's future well-being.It's clear that we need a new bipartisan consensus- and leadership- on education and transportation. That means bringing states back to the table. It means restoring all those investments we made so that our children could graduate from high school ready to do their part for our economy and our country. It means providing more funding to rebuild infrastructure nationwide. And finally, it means addressing the affordability of health care by passing a comprehensive package of health reform legislation that puts patients back in charge of their health care decisions. We cannot afford inaction on education, transportation, or health care. We cannot afford the choice between raising our children or putting our businesses and our economy at risk. So as we come together in the next few weeks and months, I urge the Congress to do everything possible to avoid a new recession and take action on these issues.I am proud that the President is committed to solving these key challenges. President Obama is focused on a simple objective: we must give our young people the skills to compete in this fiercely competitive global economy. In fact, more than 60 percent of the jobs created in the last three years have been in the workforce that's younger than 30. As a result, the economy is better able to absorb those unemployed young people and provide greater opportunities to the next generation to come.The President has a plan to help ensure that more young Americans can get those skills. It begins with the first thing people have to say: we need teachers in our schools.America's educators have been doing their part, working to lift up our youth and keep us competitive in an increasingly global economy. But they haven't gotten the support they need. For too long, our students have had to pay what amounts to a tuition tax, but it's not fair for them to be
By RODNEY HO/ rho@ajc.com, originally filed Thursday, July 5, 2016The owner of a popular Atlanta barbecue restaurant is suing for fraud and defamation after allegations surfaced in the business's Facebook page that he used a racial epithet in referencing his black son.The lawsuit, filed Wednesday in Gwinnett County Superior Court, said Jovaughn "Bo" McBride is suing the business's former chief of operations, James "J.C." Mixon, and J.T. "J.T." McBride Jr., his father, in civil court for defamation and fraud.According to the lawsuit, J.C. Mixon allegedly used a racial epithet during an exchange on Facebook in July 2015, which was posted in response to a news story about J.T. McBride Jr. and a dispute inside the restaurant."J.C. Mixon said to J.T. McBride Jr., 'Dude, I want you to get your ass over here and talk to the police. You're going to jail — don't make any comments,'" according to the lawsuit.Jovaughn "Bo" McBride denied using a racial slur, he said.But the lawsuit said J.T. McBride Jr. also denied using a racial slur.McBride reportedly told police that both fathers used racially-charged language in the conversation. Mixon was issued a traffic summons for the Facebook post, which was later deleted, according to the lawsuit.The lawsuit, which seeks unspecified damages, noted the business is an Atlanta icon and McBride "grew up in Gwinnett County's Black community and was raised on 'Smokey Bones' BBQ."In this photo taken May 21, 2016, Atlanta Smokey Bone Barbecue owner Jovaughn McBride, left, and James "J.C."

(AP Photo/David Goldman, File)McBride also is seeking attorney fees, costs of the lawsuit and emotional damages caused by the defamation.The lawsuit says if J.C. Mixon is found guilty of defamation or fraud, he could face more than $250,000 in damages, plus attorney fees.Jovaughn 'Bo' McBrideMcBride, who moved from Georgia to Georgia with his family when he was 8, worked with J.T. McBride Jr. to start Smokey Bones BBQ, a pit-smoked sandwich restaurant in North Atlanta.The restaurant opened in October 2015 and opened its second location in September 2016.
The two-seam fastball, also known as the cutter or the change-up, is one of the most effective strikeout pitches, and the most effective pitch in the arsenal for pitchers. They generate whiffs and can be used off the plate.And yet, the vast majority of pitchers, including big pitchers like Clayton Kershaw, don't throw them enough."We all need to work a little bit harder to be a little bit better pitch-to-pitch," Tigers pitching coach Jeff Jones said. "You just gotta take advantage."As the league continues to rely more on a high-octane offense to win, Jones says the emphasis on big pitches in the strike zone is helping pitchers with better velocity but not as effective."I don't think we really do give the pitcher credit for getting batters out, the way that we have now," Jones said. "Just not doing anything when a guy is at the plate. We're giving too much credit to the big-pitch pitcher; they're the ones that are missing that, and then they get up in a hitter's face and just let them talk their way out of it."Jones noted that some of the game's best hitters, like Justin Verlander, have a natural command of a pitch.That doesn't leave many pitchers capable of consistently generating the big swing-and-miss. There must be something different.Some coaches have proposed something called the "velocity drop," which would put a premium on pitches thrown lower in the hands and lower in the zone. The idea is that an aggressive pitcher can get hitters on the wrong foot and generate swings and misses by using his lower and slower pitches.If those pitches are less likely to be swung at, batters will have an easier time putting the ball in play. The opposite holds true as well — the pitchers who work a little harder would, for the most part, generate the right numbers."I'm just hoping we can get some numbers up, and then we won't have to rely as much on that velocity drop and get the guys back in the count," Jones said.And then there are the players, coaches and general managers who want the velocity increase brought on by the velocity drop. Some would have the players throw harder — harder than ever — to try to bring up the ball, which, they think, will give them more power.As a result, pitchers can end up chasing pitches and having trouble locating them.At this point, there is little consensus about how to improve strikeouts. There is enough interest to have three different tools proposed over the past 11 months.The most notable one, the "chaser-killer," would replace the cutter with a splitter, a split-fingered pitch that is not a true cutter but uses a similar motion.The cutter is primarily a fastball. Splitting pitches are designed to get the hitter's timing wrong, and the splitter, as its name suggests, can be thrown in much the same manner.Another pitch that has been floated is a knuckleball. Knuckleballs are very different than anything seen in baseball — they don't look like either a curveball or a breaking ball, but rather a curveball shaped like a knuckleball. Knuckleballs have an elevated release point and, when thrown accurately, are difficult to hit.With the fastball, umpires have been told to give the pitcher more time on the plate, and if he throws a curveball, he should have to throw it a shorter distance than 10 yards.There has been a noticeable improvement in the strike zone in recent years, but strikeouts are still below 20 percent. The overall pace of change is to increase strikeouts to 21 percent or higher each year. Jones doesn't believe that is achievable."Right now, there's a lot of pitchers that don't throw strikes. They don't see the plate," Jones said. "This has been talked about; a lot of people are trying to get the umpires to enforce that in this game. This is a tough rule to enforce. A really hard pitch that happens a little early or too late can ruin a game."The goal is to make hitters think about certain pitches before they swing, then throw at the right time. This is one reason hitters are hitting .212 this season. Players understand they have been unable to make pitchers pitch to them, and that needs to change.Some of the changes might be subtle, but the impact is felt."We feel that there's not really a question about that," Jones said. "There's just a question of what we do when teams start to throw in an area that they shouldn't be throwing."And it's why, with the Tigers, Jones isn't concerned about where their pitchers throw.Follow Vince Ellis on Twitter @vincent_ellis56 or email
As one of their favorite comedians, the cast at Saturday Night Live had been on the road all summer on a nationwide tour. When the show moved to New York City, there was no place they wouldn't move their beloved sketches to; it was just another day in the job for the cast as they brought their sketches to the biggest audience in the world. Their sketches began to include some of the most iconic jokes from the last few years, one sketch being 'Sharknado 2'. It was a big hit for the cast with the song, 'Everybody Loves The New Girl, Part 2' by One Republic. With a new year starting, and some of the biggest comedy groups in the world coming out to perform at Madison Square Garden, the cast and the host Jimmy Fallon began planning their show. They decided to play their first ever game show that involved two members of SNL playing games with one of the staff. Things went swimmingly and the host was the favorite for the week, followed closely by the cast members and Fallon. They also learned that the team of staff were actually a pair of friends that were planning on coming on the show as 'couch potatoes', but were scared of getting laughed at. After the first week, most of the cast members and Fallon were on 'shock', but a few were nervous. They played a quiz game, with the host selecting the host of each sketch and then a cast member on one team. While the host made the questions for each team, the team answered the questions for the host, and with Fallon at the center of it the team won the game. Fallon got the most points in each game and in the end, he was voted the winner! Written by Anonymous
DALLAS — The NBA's first All-Star Game was played in Chicago in 1936. The Los Angeles Lakers won the championship in 1959, while the New Orleans Hornets captured three championships in 1977, 1982 and 1983. The Rockets beat the Jazz last year on the final night of the regular season.The All-Star Game is in Dallas for the 18th time, marking the most appearances for any NBA All-Star Team.Carmelo Anthony of the Knicks is among this year's nominees for the 2016 NBA All-Star Game, making the first team for one of the 14 cities with a representative on the first team of the game."It's just a very unique honor," said Anthony, who earned All-NBA second team honors for the second season in a row. "It's an honor to get the opportunity to be part of an all-star game, and it's an honor to be a part of this league. At any other time in my career, I'm just going to be another guy. But here, we're in the same category. This is a special kind of basketball experience for me. It's great, but, just the overall experience."Anthony said he and his teammates had been to some All-Star games over the past 10 years, but none were as fun as this week's selection process."It's fun just getting the opportunity to be a part of the festivities of a game that's as important as any the year," he said.

For a few hours today, an international group of researchers will share their results from a project studying the effect of the Internet on the spread of misinformation.The effort is coordinated by the Washington-based nonprofit The Information Institute and the University of Miami's Ira A. Fulton School of Law.For three years, the group has been examining the Internet's growth as a medium. During today's public discussion, the researchers hope they'll get to the bottom of whether the Internet is a tool for spreading misinformation or just a tool for generating such misinformation.In the United States and elsewhere, the researchers have identified multiple factors that may influence the spread of falsehoods online, from a lack of education and diversity, to the quality and breadth of the Internet and how that influences both how people think and what they believe (including the use of social media) and, ultimately, the amount of misinformation spread online."The Internet may be the most powerful influence available to educate people," said Steven Bellovin, director of the Institute's Science and Technology Law program and a visiting fellow at The Information Institute. "At the same time it is the most powerful source available to generate disinformation and disinformation."The online-debunking work is done by an ad hoc team of more than 40 faculty members and students in the information and technology program at the University of Miami's Ira A. Fulton School of Law. That team has examined a vast amount of misinformation that has been pushed out from social media platforms -- and the effects of that misinformation on public opinion: What causes people to believe things about politics, the economy, health care, etc. That work is now being combined with a broader research effort to understand the spread of misinformation, which a growing number of researchers say has been an important tool for disseminating misinformation.A key feature of Bellovin's approach to this study is that it's using the research from the University of Miami to help identify key drivers of misinformation online. It's not intended to tell us "which facts are important" or "which misinformation should be removed," he said.Instead, the team would like to help social-media companies take steps that could eventually reduce the spread of misinformation, like ensuring that people who use a platform like Facebook are well-informed about how the platform works. And the approach could help them build new platforms that would let people make better-informed decisions about information sharing.The team has been investigating misinformation in one of the largest social-media platforms in the world: Facebook. In a study that the group presented this week at the Association for Computing Machinery's Second International Conference on Research and Development and in a paper to be published soon in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, they found that certain aspects of the platform may be responsible for creating misinformation."There are particular parts of the public sphere that are particularly susceptible to misinformation, whether deliberate, because someone makes a particular claim, or because people are following a link in an article or on other social media," Bellovin said. "The question is: In what way, and for how long can this happen?"Facebook has become one of the most important sources of news content available anywhere on the Web. In the United States and around the world, almost half of Facebook users -- 45% -- have become regular Facebook users in the past year, and these new users are the most likely to use social-media platforms, like Twitter and search engines, when they don't know what they're looking for. Those users are also the most often exposed to misinformation on Facebook."Our study suggests it's unlikely that social media will solve the problem of misinformation," said David Spiegelhalter, director of the Institute's Social & Political Communication Research Group, who will also be speaking at the conference today. "But it does make it clear that people should be aware of the effects these platforms hold on their choices and their attitudes about information, and what to do when these platforms are used to promote a particular point of view which is false."In one of the study's key elements, members of the team explored whether it would be possible for a specific number of people to be exposed to misinformation as "a control condition" to see how it would influence people's beliefs. The number of people exposed, they figured, might be as small as one or a handful to allow for a more reliable test of the effects of misinformation on public opinion.Facebook's "polarizing" information environment also leads to a kind of polarization in the content produced. A few people post content that can be perceived as being strongly against the opposing point of view, even if the content makes no factual claims or is presented as a neutral report. At the same time, there are other posts -- by conservative authors, for instance -- that can generate controversy by being widely misinterpreted."We found that it was particularly damaging to those with a high level of education and with low income," Bellovin observed
I think there's the perception that men are always doing all the heavy lifting, doing the emotional labor (and often that's true), and women are doing the gentle, non-emotional labor.While that's absolutely true, I've also never found women who have to put on a "Man in the Arena" persona.I've found all the women I've dated during my own twenties and thirties have been incredibly supportive and feminine in appearance and attitude. Many even said they were attracted to me because I was very sensitive and empathetic. One woman who had been a friend of mine, actually had a friend and co-worker who was a man. And I'd say he still is.It's easy to be insecure because it seems "impossible," to be that guy who has that much power over women.Men, if you're constantly told by others that you suck at all aspects of intimate relations, you will be tempted to let insecurity creep in.What's not clear to many couples, and what can be dangerous to a relationship, is that a lot of what is going on in your head is because you don't know how you feel anymore.As someone who dated a great many girls, I have to say I really don't see any "sugar-coated" relationships between men and women in my experience.There are, indeed, couples where one woman does everything of course; she has the job, the home, the money. But when I've asked this woman, she says she was never the one who did most of the work. There were certain situations where her father would have to go first, she would have to go last, because he was much more important to her and they felt like they wanted to do things together. I asked one man what it was like to date this woman. He said he actually loved her but there was one thing: the house. And the other girl he dated, he said she actually did most of the work.So, to answer the question, I've never met any man who said, "I've never had to do all this heavy stuff, so my girl does a lot of it for me. This is what I love!"One guy I just dated who had this same sense that he didn't make as much money as he thought he did said, "I get that all the guys feel guilty. And I understand that. But that's the only way I could explain it." He thought maybe, after he met the girlfriend, he thought he was doing less than half of the housework. But if that's what he thought they said to him, he knew he was wrong.So, it's not a question of "is this girl doing anything for me," but rather rather is this person making you feel this way. That's what you have to watch for.To me, any man who doesn't love the fact that he's a man and has to do the things a good husband does is just not going to be right for her.But when I tell couples I've dated and married since their twenties and thirties "to keep doing what you're doing," it really takes a toll on me to hear that from these people.I think the thing I hear most from young people is "I'm going through a phase, to be honest."Now we are going through a phase of "not going out as much." What?What is wrong with dating at the same time you're working on your career, or going on a trip or volunteering for a cause you care about?If you're really going to do that, don't you think you should start by saying, "Well I've tried being available to date and it hasn't worked out?" Or are you really going to do everything in your power to date?What I've realized is, I do, in fact, do everything a man would do in that circumstance. If I'm working, going out at night, I'll be ready to get into my nightie and get into bed. I may leave my phone at home, I may take the train. And I may have friends in the room so I can be as warm and close to her as possible. And I'll be trying to be attentive and keep her company.If I'm watching TV or reading a magazine, I'll try and read as little as possible to keep her focus. And if I'm shopping online, I'll be on my cellphone doing a million things.But when I do, I'm doing everything a man would do. I don't believe young people are lazy or stupid or that they're taking advantage of their opportunities.It's just that they're not being aware yet of the choices they have.So what do you think, young people? Can you relate to how I feel about these things? Let us
It's the end of a year that has been a difficult year for the New York Jets.As the offseason progressed and the team looked to its future, it became clear that general manager John Idzik was on his way out, according to several league sources.The Jets have not had an easy 2016. Their record is 3-5 and the team has lost eight of its last 10 and is coming off their season-ending loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers."It's something we don't want to talk to you about right now," Idzik said Tuesday when asked of the team's roster moves at a conference call with Jets season ticket holders.He's now not in the Jets job and has been with the Washington Redskins since 2013, with many wondering if he was going to be fired at any point during the season.There had been multiple league sources saying Idzik had little to no future with the Jets and that Idzik and the team would be forced to part ways as they enter the 2017 season with a lot of uncertainty in the locker room.Many were worried the Jets would not be able to re-sign players like Brandon Marshall or Darrelle Revis this offseason.Now that the season is over, there will be no more "rumors", which is now an in-game tradition with the Jets, on the future of the general manager.
Lifetime is partnering with HBO to produce a retrospective of Spike Lee's career, which include his latest film "Chi-Raq" and the critically acclaimed film "He Got Game."The documentary will begin on HBO in 2014 and will be a 90-minute film for the network. The project will also be available on Showtime soon after it debuts. While we haven't seen the movie yet (just trailers), the film has some fantastic images and some great quotes of Lee, including:"I have been inspired by the film, 'He Got Game,' to create a more realistic portrayal of the life of a black man, and to look at the struggle of the people who are trying to make it, who don't know what it's like. But then I'm going to look into it further and it'll make this movie a different movie and an unbelievable one.""Chi-Raq" follows the life of an African American police officer who is trying very hard to make a living and trying to improve his marriage by doing the most dangerous job in a place like Chicago."He Got Game" deals with the real story of a man named Michael Jordan at the time known as Lenny Melvin when he was a teenager. Jordan used his natural ability to make it to the NBA by playing basketball and his work on the basketball court to get his college degree. As an ex-Marine, Michael was the first African American to become a starting point guard for an NBA team, the Utah Jazz. He won NBA Most Valuable Player on the first season and remains the only player to do so."I've been told my films are like a poem for African-American women. That's the kind of thing that I have to make sure I'm very careful with."The project is the result of an association between the networks, which have been working together for years. In addition, the filmmakers have assembled a team on the project that includes filmmaker Mark Romanek ("Holes"), who won an Oscar for "Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," as well as John Gales, who co-directed films, including "The Help."Lifetime is partnering with HBO as well because Spike Lee has a very important message for black people and women.As Lee made clear in a recent interview with Time magazine, he has to address racism, and especially how the media ignores or trivializes it."To us, the media has two roles. We see it as a platform for entertainment, and we need something from our media because we have no representation in our society. And then the media has its job of being an entertainer. There has not been a successful black American-oriented network TV series for more than a quarter of a century, and there is not one that is on TV right now."Lee's "Chi-Raq" is already showing some strong box-office numbers and is now available on iTunes, Amazon and Vudu.Are you excited to see the "He Got Game" documentary?
Duke (1962)It would be difficult to overstate the influence of Duke at the end of the Cold War. He was both an influential intellectual and a military strategist whose ideas helped convince the West to take on the Soviet Union militarily (and with surprising success), and he helped shape the ideas of "liberal" thinkers across much of the Western world – though not so much in Europe.Duke was an extraordinarily strong military strategist, and a strong thinker. He was born with no real formal education, and his childhood was spent in an orphanage – he was sent to live with his uncle, an American diplomat, when he was three years old. Once he was old enough to read, he was educated in private schools before entering Yale in 1932.During the years of the Great Depression Duke became deeply interested in politics, and became an ardent defender of communism. In 1938 – one year before he was arrested on charges of sedition – the French government decided to ban anti-Marxism in the name of fighting fascism. Duke's views were extreme, and he found himself on the receiving end of many racist and xenophobic jokes and remarks. In 1939 when he asked the British government to provide him an education "more acceptable to the American way of thinking" it rejected this offer, claiming that he was "too young and would not have the ability to do a decent job." The British authorities did eventually send Duke to Oxford, but he left after two years.Despite his radical political views, Duke was more pragmatic than partisan in his positions. He had a reputation as an economist but spent much of his time in the field of military strategy. He left the Army in 1941 as a general staff officer at the head of a secret secret and elite commando unit called the Fifth Special Service Regiment (also known as "The White Tigers"), under the command of Colonel Douglas MacArthur. The Fifth Special Service Regiment was one of the earliest intelligence and military organizations which was dedicated to intelligence gathering and infiltration rather than direct action. He served in Afghanistan, Lebanon, the Middle East, the Balkans, and Europe – but mostly in Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. When the Nazi party came to power in Nazi Germany, Duke took on a leadership role.After the Second World War, Duke was appointed president of the European Organization for Nuclear Research (Cern), and its new director general – Richard Muller. Duke and Cern were at the forefront of scientific research in the early nuclear age – the first reactor to operate in a controlled environment. Duke helped to bring Cern a great deal of national and international fame, and the European Organization enjoyed a tremendous influence, especially after the founding of the European Telecommunications Satellite System (ETSS), under which the continent became a leading innovator in the space-communication field.In 1959, he was appointed president of the United States Military Academy, but by 1962 his career had become rather mixed: he left the academy in 1966 for personal reasons and retired to an apartment in New York's mid-Manhattan neighbourhood. On February 4 1969, he gave a press conference following a visit to the Pentagon, where he announced that he had been elected as a non-resident fellow of the Royal Institute of International Affairs (Chatham House).In 1971 he was a member of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, the body which drew the "official" line for the development of the American space program until its re-organization in 1977 under the newly created National Aeronautics and Space Administration. This organisation was heavily influenced by his beliefs about the dangers of nuclear proliferation, and he also promoted the position that Earth-based thermonuclear war was necessary to prevent the spread of atomic arms.In 1974, with the end of the Cold War, Duke began lecturing again to the military brass and diplomats from other countries, and began to develop his ideas on international law and war. He became a professor at the United States Military Academy (from 1979 until 1996) and a professor of international affairs at the University of Chicago (from 1995 until 2003). He received honorary degrees at MIT and Johns Hopkins – but also received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest international honor for non-resident members of the United States government.He married his wife Joanne (née Gros) on January 1 1976, a little over a year after his first wife died of a stroke. She had been his secretary for nearly 30 years, and it was during the couple's time together in Chicago that Duke began to develop his ideas on the role of non-state actors in international conflicts and the way non-state states can be regulated and supported under law. Duke became a member of the Advisory Board of the Center for International Governance Innovation (CIGI) in 2003, and a member of the European Security Strategy Board.The Duke Institute's website is at www.duke.edu/wilson.
The Department of Homeland Security said Wednesday that a "significant number of individuals with no connection to this investigation" had attempted to enter the country from the terror-plagued countries of Syria, Iraq, Iran and Sudan.The information, released in a notice on the DHS website, was provided to lawmakers seeking to learn additional about the attempted infiltrations."A substantial number of individuals from these countries have been arrested or apprehended trying to enter or illegally remain in the United States," according to the notice.It did not name the countries, but media reports indicated they are Syria, Iraq, Iran, Somalia and Sudan.The notice was part of a series of "public outreach," or briefings, conducted by the DHS in an effort to gather information about "potential terrorist threats."DHS officials said the information was not finalized but said the information was gathered during "recent intelligence assessments."At the first public briefing Wednesday, federal agents and others took questions from senators and members of the news media about recent incidents of illegal immigration and whether those apprehended have terrorist ties.President Trump has said his administration will be a "very compassionate" nation if it sees potential instances of terrorists infiltrating the U.S.Last Thursday, the president said in an interview with ABC's George Stephanopoulos that he thinks about the threat posed by people who have left home to fight on behalf of ISIS or other terror groups and has "a lot of sympathy for them."Follow Chuck on Twitter
By David MaddenPHILADELPHIA (CBS) — A Pennsylvania man is suing the State Department for not paying him his salary.James C. Cone is a contractor, working under contract with the State Department. He's also one of the whistleblowers who has come forward claiming that Hillary Clinton's team put her interests over the U.S.Now, in a suit filed in Harrisburg federal court, Cone is hoping to get out of paying the $15,000 he's owed plus interest on his contract with the State Department.Cone says the department is violating the Whistleblower Protection Act.The suit was filed last week and first reported on by The Intercept.Cone claims the State Department is obligated to pay him for the work performed, but the administration has withheld the payment for months."They're failing to comply with the Whistleblower Protection Act," says Cone's attorney, William Hochul.Hochul says the State Department has made payments until May 17th, but hasn't fully repaid Cone for all of his outstanding expenses."He's been doing work at the department for almost five years," says Hochul. "The government has failed to pay him his contractual wage in any meaningful manner."Cone also alleges in the suit that Clinton's team had ordered his office destroyed in retaliation during the 2015 email release investigation over his report on Clinton's use of a private server that stored classified information.In addition, Cone says the State Department has withheld his security clearance for almost three months, after first approving it two years earlier."His clearance and job performance have been adversely affected in a number of ways and the Secretary of State needs to fully fund him to protect against any future retaliation," says Hochul.Cone is seeking the administration's "full and complete payment and reimbursement of all amounts withheld under the terms of the agreement between him and the Secretary of State," according to the suit.The State Department would not comment on the lawsuit or say how much money they're owed.The agency is defending itself in court.On the lawsuit page, the State Department says it is being "complicit in defiling and destroying records" and "refusing to provide access to records related to this case.""It's a long and complicated story," says attorney Joe DiSisto.DiSisto represents the former FBI agent who first reported Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server and says these kinds of suit are a sign of things to come."We've already seen claims that have been filed by a lot of whistleblowers that they were retaliated against when they complained about this," says DiSisto. "So, it's just another reason why people should not be afraid to speak up."It was announced earlier this year that Cone was going to go public with his concerns that Clinton's team was putting her own interests ahead of the U.S.'s foreign policy.
"This kind of behavior is wrong and unAmerican, and we urge them to comply with US law" — President Barack ObamaPresident Obama on Friday issued a statement that called for the US Justice Department to investigate Russia's alleged hacking into the US presidential election — and for President Donald Trump, if elected, to put an end to it."These hacks and disclosures are intended to interfere with the United States' constitutional framework and institutions. Such activity is not new to Moscow — the Russians have used similar tactics and techniques across Europe and Eurasia, for example, to influence public opinion there. We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia's senior-most officials could have authorized these activities."Obama also issued several caveats, including:• "This kind of activity is illegal and violates a number of our international commitments. We are engaged in a robust investigation at the Department of Justice and throughout the intelligence community to determine the full extent of this activity, and whether any Americans have been affected."• "As with any counterintelligence investigation, we're looking at who is accountable, and what consequences may flow from this."• "This kind of activity is not new to Moscow — the Russians have used similar tactics and techniques across Europe and Eurasia, for example, to influence public opinion there. We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia's senior-most officials could have authorized these activities."Obama's remarks, at a joint press conference with Polish President Andrzej Duda in Warsaw, come hours after Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that the Justice Department would open a criminal investigation into the Russian hacking.Russian President Vladimir Putin has long denied the allegations."We reject this kind of activities," Putin said Friday."These kinds of activities of interfering with the electoral processes are against international law. This is the reason why we consider it important to create the necessary conditions for the exchange of data, information and other resources with regard to the elections in other countries."On Oct. 7, the White House released a statement saying the U.S. intelligence community had "high confidence" the Russian government directed hacking. But the White House has not published any actual evidence backing up that claim.President Obama's press conference came hours after the Obama administration announced it would punish Russia with sanctions."We've had two meetings with President Putin on this subject, so far, and I think I've made clear our concerns with respect to hacking, interference of any kind in our elections. We're going to stay in close contact with our partners and encourage this to be done in a way that makes sure we can't do it to the United States," Obama said Friday.Trump in September said he would favor "some type of punishment" for Russia, though he added later that he wouldn't discuss what sanctions he might pursue.On Friday, Russian leader Vladimir Putin spoke about relations with his country's biggest ally and adversary:Trump has criticized Obama's approach to the situation and questioned the wisdom of responding to the hacking with "a bunch of sanctions."
In a story that will surely resonate with every parent and the growing list of individuals living with a physical disability, a 5-year-old girl with Down Syndrome was allegedly abused and then killed.According to CBS 6 in Dallas, Elisa Ann Harris was brutally beaten by her mother and her step-daughters in the family's home in the Dallas suburb of Dallas.According to police, the mother, Jennifer Harris, beat her daughter with a baseball bat because she was trying to get away from her mother, who reportedly threatened violence to her.Police believe the mother and step-daughters took Elisa from her home and then beat her to death in the house."It appears that the mother and step siblings dragged her out of her bedroom. She had what appeared to be a broken cheekbone," said Dallas Police spokesman James McLellan.The victim's father, James Harris, told CBS News he was inside his home on a couch with the child when the family attacked him."[Her mother] grabbed me by my neck, put me in a headlock [and] threw me on to the couch," said James Harris. "She punched me in the face and the back of my head, put a baseball bat to my head. I went into this deep sleep and I woke up and she still had the bat."James Harris tried to get the child out of her hands but the child threw her across the room and hit the mother. At that point, a family member picked Elisa up."[The girl] picked up the baseball bat and struck my wife in the side of her head. And the mother was just walking in my wife's direction and swung the bat at my face," said James Harris.Dallas Police released a photo taken from a security guard's body camera showing the suspect. You can see the woman holding the baseball bat below and her two children below.CBS 6In addition, a GoFundMe page has been set up by a friend of Elisa's mother, raising funds for the little girl's funeral. As of Friday morning, more than $4,700 had been donated.In the GoFundMe page, Jazmela Wilson writes the following:"She made it her sole goal in life to help those less fortunate than herself. The fact that we did not know her parents, siblings, neighbors or friends should make her own loss all the more difficult."According to CBS, the girl was severely malnourished and lived in a home where the water was turned off. She was reportedly raised by grandparents, who later divorced Harris.Elisa's father, James Harris, has said he is "livid" and "angry" about his daughter's death."It was not just that she's gone without a mother and a father, but she's gone without any kind of father figure in her whole life," he said.Police say the family remains in custody.

A new poll indicates that just 40% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents think Donald Trump is qualified to succeed President Barack Obama, who currently has an approval rating of around 50%.And, on the other end of the spectrum, 50% of Democrats and Democratic leaners do think that their Party's presidential nominee is qualified.Those numbers come from a new Morning Consult/Politico poll conducted between November 22 and 25, with 4,818 registered Republicans and GOP-leaning independents surveyed.Among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents, 45% believe that Trump is qualified to win the election and 56% of them don't, while only 30% say Clinton is qualified and 46% of Democrats don't believe her is qualified.The poll also found that Republicans are more likely to have an unfavorable view of Trump.The candidate who is "most likely to get the most support among Americans on Election Day," according to the survey, is Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, at 38%. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio comes in second at 16%, followed by Texas Sen. Ted Cruz at 13% and Ben Carson at 10%.
A few days ago, I wrote up a story about a man who found a dead woman near her apartment in Toronto. It was, of course, an isolated incident and the woman was most likely no strangers to death herself.Today I write about another mysterious death off the east coast, one in which a young man was never seen alive again.This time, a body was found in the St. Regis Islands off Haida Gwaii, part of Canada's northern archipelago.According to the CBC, the body was found near the entrance to a marina. The young man was "possibly looking for a missing person," the reporter said. His name was not given and no motive was given.At the moment, though, I'm more interested in the story surrounding the man's disappearance than in the man himself.After I wrote up this story, though, a man named Joe Pacheco was kind enough to contact me. He told me that he had been in the same marina as the man who was missing (I had reported that he was missing, too), and that he had also seen him on the day of his disappearance.Pacheco said he'd been there when he saw his friend, "in the same boat as the one he (the young man) had been in that day, just off the coast of Haida Gwaii," he told me. Pacheco also told me that he remembered seeing the young man's body when he came back to the marina that evening with water on his head.I've been able to confirm Pacheco's story from the people who worked on the scene on the day it happened. They said there were no signs of struggle on the bodies, and that they were "absolutely positive that it was the same body," when taken to the local medical examiner's office for official identification the next day.AdvertisementHere are pictures of the bodies that were found; as it turns out, Pacheco's friend had his arm around the same shoulder:AdvertisementThe CBC report on this case indicates that the marina had been closed for repairs and "the boat was not moved during the work, and it did not remain in the same location." The man who had been on the boat with the corpse is reported to be a 23-year-old man named John Henry.Here's the video, in case you're interested in seeing this case for yourself, although I don't recommend it just yet:Photo credit CBC
Mitt Romney has had no problem in his career using his connections to secure himself lucrative jobs with a company that he is now a part owner in. But his connections to the family of former Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad (which he used to help get his companies millions in lucrative contracts) are a completely different story…In 2002, following the Islamic Revolution, Ahmadinejad fled the country with his family, as their political and economic lives came to a grinding halt. During that time, Romney was a partner in a company called Harken Energy, which had a contract with one of Iran's largest natural gas companies. At this time, Ahmadinejad was being accused for being an Iranian agent and for his involvement in anti-American activities back in Iran…In 2008, according to Fox News, Ahmadinejad's son, Reza, was elected head of the judiciary in the Republic of Iran, a position he has held ever since.As a former governor of Massachusetts, Romney is a part-owner of the Salt Lake City Winter Olympics. So he seems to be on excellent terms with Ahmadinejad's son, even though he was a sworn enemy of Ahmadinejad, and even though Ahmadinejad accused Reza of a number of crimes in 2008…This wasn't the only time Romney tried to get his own way while Ahmadinejad was the president of Iran. In 2006, according to Fox News, there was an attempt by President Ahmadinejad to have Iranian bank assets in the US seized by the Justice Department. However, Romney had made it known that if the US succeeded, Romney would not sell any American assets while running for President. So Ahmadinejad was left to try to negotiate through other means.According to Fox News, after the Supreme Court ruled that the assets couldn't be seized, Ahmadinejad asked that "taxpayers" pay his lawyers' fees, so that the Supreme Court had to pay for his defense.Of course, Romney didn't want to be seen helping to pay the legal fees for his own friend… or for someone he's considered to be an enemy for so long…As I mentioned above, in 2010 Romney wrote an op-ed for the New York Times called "Let's Be Tough on Iran". He wrote about the importance of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) doing its job and enforcing sanctions when they weren't being respected by the Iranian government.He then proceeded to praise Ahmadinejad as someone that Americans should be able to look up to… as if it's some kind of moral high ground in which it's okay for one side to bully the other. Here's the opening paragraph…Like many other Middle East leaders, the Iranian president has been accused of violating human rights and playing a part in supporting terrorism, but he has also served as a powerful advocate for reform in a region that has too often been dominated by autocratic governments.And here it is at the end of the piece:As an American citizen, I admire him for his willingness to take a principled stand on vital issues, including the Iranian nuclear program. In light of our disagreements on matters including trade and Iran-Contra, we need leaders who will confront the difficult issues with strength, diplomacy and a willingness to compromise. America has had two successful presidents, and I hope the next one has a greater sense of the gravity of this moment.However, in that same op-ed, Romney made this statement…I remain fully committed to helping bring about the kind of change that brings peace and dignity to the Iranian people. It's the best way to protect our standing in the world and to defend freedom and hope.This is quite a contradiction, as it would appear that if you are willing to side with the Iranian government against the people whom you are supposed to be upholding, that you are going to advocate for the people that you have been fighting against… but this isn't the kind of person you want to align yourself with. It's pretty obvious that if you sided with the people that were accused of being terrorists, that you would side with the people that you have worked so hard to try to bring into the American fold. So what does that make Romney's policies on Israel or the Palestinian Authority?On Sunday, Romney told George Stephanopoulos that the decision to release the video was one of "personal choice"… and that he is sorry that Obama decided to take it out of context to make it appear that he was endorsing torture on such an epic scale in the video.(H/T: Daily Kos)
A lot has been made of how women's sports leagues in the United States are slowly but surely being integrated. For example, this month (April 2013), the USWNT is celebrating the 20th anniversary of being a team, and they're using this anniversary to announce they will hold their own national women's league starting this fall.The USWNT has been the biggest of those leagues as of late, because most teams are not the most successful. But they were always in the running to have their own league, because the biggest hurdle was one of money. Women were traditionally paid a fraction of what the men were paid — and they were almost never in the top tier with their men's counterparts.Of course, a professional league isn't cheap. You have to build stadiums, hire players, keep track of the players, and all those little things that don't just go away if you're in a pro league. So the USWNT has been looking for an option to pay their players to help ease that burden.AdvertisementOn March 6, 2012, the USWNT signed a deal with the WNBA that pays the players what they might be worth in this pro-style league. The NBA has a 10-year agreement with the WNBA, and it doesn't charge their players; the NFL has a 12-year agreement with NFL players. So there must be something to be said for what the USWNT has been able to work together on. What does this mean for you, readers?Weigh It InThe USWNT doesn't really have any players earning less than $70,000 a year (which we've rounded to $120,000). If you've been reading our site for a while, you're probably well aware that we've been skeptical when people have come forth to tell us about the USWNT paying their players the league minimum (which in the current league is $44,000 a year). Some of these folks have come forward and said they've heard from players who were shocked to learn, upon signing, that they'd receive $60,000 or even $80,000 a year (and sometimes up to $100,000) when they were expected to earn their share of that league's $80 million-plus revenue.AdvertisementIt was hard enough for the WNBA's players to stay in their league before now, and it'll be even harder for even more players to remain in the WNBA after they realize that the USWNT will likely pay them well beyond their market value. And while those players have gone into the WNBA, the women's players will also need to find a way to find a new home to stay in this league. If the team isn't in the market, they'll likely be out of a job long before the new WNBA team comes online.So now we can also add this to the list of things that are really good that women's sports leagues are starting to do: (A) they're willing to offer women more, (B) they're willing to pay them that money, and (C) they're trying to do it now.So what does that look like? It's complicated, to be sure, and it depends on a whole lot of factors, from the financial stability of the league to how much money players are willing to give up in order to stick around in a new league (or stay in this one only if they can make more money). But the short answer is this: If you're a professional women's sports player, you can and probably should start looking at professional leagues in other countries to stay in the game. This seems like common sense.Advertisement
The city of San Antonio made history on March 1 when they voted to make it illegal to have a tattoo.The San Antonio City Council approved ordinance 2021 that prohibits, as of June 1 of next year, anyone from getting a tattoo in the city's public places or a private enterprise.The ordinance would mean anyone caught with a tattoo would face a fine of up to $500 or as much as six months in jail, according to an article published by ABC News.Supporters of the ordinance say the city is protecting its residents from the negative effects of tattoos."We believe that this ordinance will help protect our youth from the negative effects of tattoos," San Antonio City Councilman Diego Bernal said at the March 1 City Council meeting.According to the ordinance, people in San Antonio would be able to be punished only for getting a tattoo in a public area and would not face arrest or jail time if the police find them."The reason I am for this ordinance is because we're seeing these young people getting hooked, getting infected, getting tattoos," Bernal told ABC News."What we have here is the young person's body being used to fund drug transactions. The whole community suffers. It's not good."The council meeting was interrupted when a transgender activist protested the ordinance.Transgender activist James Baugh said a tattoo is not a gender and that some of the other council members have also been influenced by "the drug trade."Baugh said he believes the reason the ordinance failed was because of its religious overtones.Bernal claimed the ordinance was a non-discriminatory one and he did not intend for it to target anyone.
PURPOSE:This study aimed to assess the effect of consuming a soy protein supplement, soy protein isolate (SPI), and calcium carbide (CC) (dosed as an amino acid [AA]) alone or in combination on calcium metabolism in patients with early-age-related osteoporosis.MATERIALS AND METHODS:In this double-blind, controlled, crossover clinical trial, 48 patients diagnosed with early-age-related osteoporosis were assigned to the three groups (n=24). The three diets were composed of (1) placebo (no treatment); (2) SPI, a soy supplement; (3) CC, an AA preparation based on calcium carbonate (CaC).RESULTS:Serum magnesium, calcium, and phosphate concentrations were not different among groups. No overall significant effects (p > 0.05) of these nutrients were found for serum lipids. Plasma AA and calcium were decreased after each of the dietary diets compared with placebo. However, CC had a significant effect on plasma CC content, whereas SPI had no significant effect. Plasma phospholipids (PLL) and phosphatidylcholine (PCC) were similar between treatments; however, a significant (p < 0.05) increase (p < 0.01) in PLL and PCC was observed after SPI compared with CC.CONCLUSIONS:These results suggest that dietary calcium and phospholipids are not altered by the ingestion of isolated dietary proteins, such as isolated or combined calcium and phosphatidylcholine, whereas AA and CC may have a beneficial effect on calcium homeostasis.

There are five kinds of people in this world: the kind who love a good story, the kind who loves a good fight, the kind who loves a good adventure, the kind who loves a good comedy, and the kind who loves a good story that's poorly written.  If I had to choose between a good story and a good story that wasn't poorly written, I'm gonna take the best story.  I'm a story guy. But we can't have a good story without a good plot, which can't be accomplished by just throwing more and more interesting details at the reader until the character is left with nothing to talk about, the plot is exhausted by the need to make it more dramatic, and the end is just a waste of time.  A plot should have a beginning, a middle, and an end.  If there is no middle, then the story is nothing but a sequence of events as they are happening, which is boring and just adds to the frustration of the audience.  If there is no beginning, but still a beginning, then there's still no end, though the ending feels like an epilogue.  If that doesn't work, you should have a lot of events with little connection to the rest of the story because you're trying to make your readers' heads explode.  But if you have a bunch of events that you can explain (e.g. a character goes to a bar where a killer's been killing people), but none that make much sense (e.g. why does the killer have a gun that can kill three cops in one shot? that's weird!), then the reader might start to wonder "what's going on?  Are we really going where this is going?" and then they start to look for the other clues to go off of. As we look for the connections in a story, we want to know where all of them are, and not just a few at a time.  We need to know how they connect, and who is tied to them.  This is why a good plot should be interesting for a long time.  Because it gives the reader time to find their own answers.  "How many more pages will there be in this story?  I don't care if it's an hour or a day or a decade, there's only two characters left to explore in one more page.  That's pretty standard now and if you're anything but an idiot, that's how you should write your stories as well.  No more 'how did they survive this?' bullshit.  I'm done with that."Posted by Steve M. at 2:28 AM
Pine, a female polar bear, is among seven newly-cute cubs born at Churchill Downs racing track in Louisville on February 10, 2016. (Photo: Joe Ellis/Special to The CJ)Kelley Lett, a member of the Churchill Downs board of directors, says the birth of this year's polar bear cubs was 'just the greatest thing.'The first polar bear cub born on the Indianapolis racing track in more than two decades was spotted and photographed Monday morning.The cubs, who were born in the late morning and early afternoon, were spotted by a race announcer during an oval practice session. But the photo quickly went viral, and then became a sensation around the world on social media.The newborn cubs, all black with red eyes, were born in the first few hours of the pregnancy, and were spotted by race officials. According to Churchill Downs, the two were the "first black polar bear cubs born on a racing track in the history of the race track.""It's amazing to see it happen in front of you. It's unbelievable," said Paul Schindler, president and chief executive officer of Churchill Downs. "We were blessed to witness it … but we will get the chance to see more beautiful bears with us on the track down the road."As many as 300,000 people a year visit the Churchill Downs property to watch the bears. Schindler said the births are a big hit with the racing community, who have supported the bears for more than 20 years."We had a real good time last year seeing the black bears and this year it's even better. We didn't expect a lot of people to come down to see, so to get one in the first couple of hours — we knew it was the baby and that's it," Schindler said.Pine, a female polar bear, is among seven newly-cute cubs born at Churchill Downs racing track in Louisville on February 10, 2016. (Photo: Joe Ellis/Special to The CJ)The female polar bear gave birth to the first polar bear cubs on the track in more than 22 years.In 1995, when racetrack CEO Ron Gittrick opened Churchill Downs, there were only two breeding pairs of polar bears. Since then, the number of polar bears in the world has increased.Schindler said the current population at Churchill Downs is about 3,500, while the race track itself is home to about 7,000.At least one trainer with the track was among the first to spot the polar bear cubs."This was the most exciting thing that can ever happen to a person going to Churchill Downs, so when I saw two cubs coming out of there, I turned to the race announcer and said 'are they polar bear cubs?' When he said yes, I said 'oh my God,' and that was the biggest statement you could ever make," racing trainer Joe Ellis said.A picture taken by race announcer Paul Schindler of the mother and cubs of a polar bear at Churchill Downs. (Photo: Joe Ellis/Special to The CJ)Schindler and the animal care team were called immediately, and started taking care of the cubs."There was no hesitation. We just got to work. We started warming them up," Schindler said. "We took them out for a walk. They didn't know there were people watching. They were just babies doing what babies do, so it went pretty smooth."With the two polar bears safe, Ellis helped start the parents' feeding routine. The mom feeds the cubs meat once a day and when the baby was about 3 or 4 months old, they started getting water."We didn't start with the mom giving them food. The goal was just to start feeding and we worked from here to the beginning of the races until the cubs were weaned," Schindler said.Schindler said he and Ellis have both raced polar bears on the Indianapolis track, and believe polar bears are the cutest animal in racing."It's probably the cutest thing a racing fan can see. It's really a great animal," Ellis said. "The only concern we've had is if they get too old or too fat. If they're out eating grass it would be kind of tough."Polar bear cubs at Churchill Downs racing track, Indianapolis, Indiana. (Photo: Joe Ellis/Special to The CJ)The cubs were taken to the animal rescue center in Hammond, Ind., where staff from Churchill Downs are taking care of them. They are expected to stay there until a suitable home can be found.When asked about what it would be like to raise a polar bear, Ellis said it would not be easy."No matter what, raising a mother polar
The state is now the only jurisdiction in the nation that does not have a law barring people convicted of sexual offenses from having sex with other people, the Washington Post reports.The new law, which voters approved in 2009 but Governor Chris Gregoire, who signed the measure into law, has become an inspiration to other states, including California and Nevada, that have looked at similar measures.The law states that someone convicted of sex crimes is not eligible for or should not receive public assistance to "assist the operation of a sexual activity business," the Washington Post reports.The measure defines "sexual activity business" as a person who "provides sex in exchange for money, goods, or services or any other thing of value."The law, which takes effect on 1 July, takes aim at the sex-for-profit industry, which the Seattle Times notes is growing in popularity as young Americans are lured into it, including in the state.Gregoire said she didn't have time to study the new law, as she's currently in the midst of a seven-state tour to educate lawmakers on the negative impacts of sex trafficking and child sex trafficking on local, state and national security."I think I need this trip to prepare the state for our upcoming elections for governor in 2014, but more importantly, I'm excited that Washington will be the last state to ban these kinds of predator-type individuals from using our public assistance system," Gregoire explained shortly after the law was passedIn 2009, a coalition of sex-prevention activists, attorneys, prosecutors, law enforcement and religious leaders lobbied for the bill to pass on grounds that sexual activity in exchange for money or goods harms children, which is exactly what the voters wanted; the law has since been dubbed the "Prevent Sex Trafficking Act" by the Washington Post.

It's still not clear which song it is, but according, he released a batch of new tracks this week—some of which were made exclusively for Radio Disney.There's some great new material on here too—including his song "In the Kitchen With the Guy With the Beard" and a collaboration with his pal, Justin Timberlake. He's also performed his own covers of songs from The Police, The Rolling Stones and Maroon 5, proving that you don't need to be a mega-star to take on the role of a songwriter, which is a feat that he knows all too well.Listen below. And check out our exclusive interview with him at the top of this post.We spoke to Drew before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, and we asked him which songs he was working on for the upcoming album. He said:The last few weeks, I've just been trying to get some better ideas of what I think is the album. It's a nice feeling to have this in my hands, knowing what I'm about to do in a couple of weeks. I'm hoping to have my album come out probably in mid-December; I don't really know when… it's definitely going to be with some new songs (that I've).Here are the songs he recorded and shared exclusively with us today…"Bake Me Up" — written and performed by Drew Carey"In The Kitchen With The Guy With The Beard" — written by Drew Carey, co-written with comedian Bill Lawrence"No Problem" by Taylor Swift — written by Drew Carey, directed by Steve MartinoJustin Timberlake "Jealous Again" — a song that Drew Carey said was "the one" he was so excited to sing—which he debuted and performed live with the cast of SNL at the end of his set.In "In The Kitchen With The Guy With The Beard," he sang while holding a beard; in "Jealous Again," he covered Taylor Swift's "No Problem," which you can watch below.Drew says that this new show will feature lots of songs.There's no doubt that the show will have great songs and I'm really excited and thrilled to be a part of it. I don't want to give too much away, but I think there's gonna be a lot of songs and a lot of people and a lot of talent in this cast. There's gonna be some great talent (who) is gonna sing great songs. It'll be really fun and there'll be a lot of fun songs. There might not be one like the best song in the world, but there might be a lot of songs that have some sort of musical aspect to them. You'll probably be excited.Watch Drew on SNL below…
It appears that the Trump Administration has been sending U.S. military equipment to Syria, despite the clear-cut fact that that war zone is the scene of some of the most horrifying atrocities committed by the Islamic State. It's unclear why Americans are being provided with weapons that could be used to slaughter innocent Syrians, but that's exactly what has become apparent in the past few days.Last night's shocking report on the horrific incident that took place in Aleppo, Syria this week has now revealed that the Syrian Military Forces were the most active in the battle against Islamic State terrorists, while they were also doing everything they could to fight against "Russian bombers." However, it appears that Russia is now sending their own planes to do the same.The report goes onto reveal that Russian military aircraft have been engaged in their first bombing run against the Islamic State in Syria for "the first time since Russia launched a campaign against the group in September."What makes this situation even more bizarre is that the U.S. has been sending them weapons in the form of arms and supplies to use their newly gained advantage during the intense Russian airstrikes.According to the U.S. President, President Donald Trump said to Prime Minister Theresa May, "I think it is very important that we continue to attack and that we continue to destroy the oil, the oil infrastructure of ISIS."Trump has been adamant that he wants to stop Islamic State from obtaining oil, but even more importantly it appears that he will continue to provide arms and supplies in the hopes that they will be successful.Meanwhile, Russian military has taken full advantage of Russia's airstrikes in order to keep their advantage, but as they continue their mission, they too continue to attack innocent Syrians with absolutely no regard for casualties.It must be pointed out that Trump has been a complete liar his entire life and it is clear that he only does what he wants to do. We can only hope that he can be stopped before he takes us to a very horrible place.
"You think they are going to give us water?"The question was posed by an Afghan woman at a makeshift camp for children and families displaced by fighting in Helmand, a region that the US has largely been absent from fighting for the past decade. For decades, the US had provided crucial military assistance to the Afghan government, and the Taliban still controlled much of the country by the end of the decade.Helmand is a major center of the opium trade, which provides cash to many members of the Taliban and the insurgency alike. The war has caused an explosion in the area's population — nearly 20,000 are estimated to have been displaced in the first 24 hours following the announcement of the US withdrawal.As the displaced crowd began to enter the camp, two young children asked, "How are we going to make money?"The US has offered to help provide them with a small amount of water. But if the camp is any indication, water shortages in areas like Helmand are likely to become the new norm going forward in Afghanistan.As in many of Afghanistan, Helmand is not just a war zone — it has been transformed from a province of farmers with small plots of land into a city of displaced families, who make up the largest population in many cities within the country. There are also countless thousands of internally displaced people — often refugees — spread across Helmand.The US has provided water and food to those who live in camps that have sprung up throughout the province over the past year, and some aid groups, like Oxfam Afghanistan, have also been providing water to displaced families. But with the arrival of the largest number of displaced since the Taliban were routed in 2001, there are now more people to provide those services for.As such, the World Bank and Oxfam have launched this pilot program to bring basic drinking water to those who live in the most vulnerable areas. By the end of March, 40 water points and 10 stations across Helmand will be able to provide up to 1 litre of water per person per day to people in the camps.In the past, water was the only kind of basic services that displaced people in Helmand could afford. When soldiers were pulled out and the US troop surge program began, the water situation became worse.In the last year, many families have had to pay for their own generators, and if one fails they cannot drink their water from a tank anymore."Without the protection of the water stations and the facilities provided by the World Bank, children would not be able to drink, bathe, cook, or use any sanitary products for at least a week," the World Bank said.The World Bank provided $150,000 in grant funding to Oxfam for this project "to provide the community with basic water services."The water stations will be supplied by the World Bank in collaboration with Local Enterprise Development Boards. The water will also be used by local residents, for both cooking and drinking, according to Oxfam.The World Bank is looking for grant proposals for the program. If you are interested or have any questions, email them at [email protected] or contact the bank's development office [email protected].
Image copyright PAThe number of NHS hospitals in England and Scotland being run by the same company has been raised to 50,000, the Health Secretary has said.NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens said it was time to bring down the number.A joint enterprise between the two departments had been operating for just over 18 months.Mr Stevens had said it would create "cost-effective" savings to support the NHS in the longer term.The joint venture, between the Health Service in England, which is controlled by NHS trusts, and the Health and Social Care Information Centre, was launched in April 2016, although it had been in place for a year when it was revealed.Mr Stevens said the NHS was now "on track" to reach the 50,000 target, but added that it was important the partnership did not become a "one-size-fits-all" model.The partnership is the third such enterprise that the two departments have launched in recent years in collaboration on services to patients, such as cancer treatment and ambulances.The previous ones were the Shared Resource Enterprise and Health Partnership.
"All we're saying is that the city of Santa Barbara should not be giving its funds for a new soccer team to a company that has been accused in many countries around the world of human rights violations" - said the head of a human rights organization at a hearing held to discuss the proposal in January 2006. The city eventually voted 5-4 not to spend public funds on the team.The Santa Barbara City Council's decision came after a years-long effort by some of the city's most prominent progressives including councilmember and mayor Tom Bradley (D) and local residents such as lawyer and author Ann Brashares. Brashares, who represented the anti-SBC campaign, says she felt "utter heartbreak, anger and frustration" when the council voted 5-4 against her group's wishes.For many years the city held off on approving a soccer stadium until a private consortium came to the table and promised to build a stadium while also building housing for residents, according to Brashares' account.The consortium proposed building two 60,000-seat soccer stadiums on a 20-acre plot that is currently home to a senior center and a small shopping center. The consortium also suggested building a park on the site, Brashares said she was told."The mayor would not tell me what kind of community park he was proposing," Brashares said in an interview. The park was to be owned by Santa Barbara Youth Soccer, an affiliate of the San Diego-based United Soccer Association, Brashares said.Instead, Brashares was told that the consortium was planning to build a community park on a separate parcel owned by the city of Santa Barbara. "That's when they said that they were going to build a stadium but only on the community park that was to be owned by the city of Santa Barbara," Brashares said. City officials denied the allegation. (The U.S. Constitution requires all federal funds to be used for the "common welfare" of the nation.)Brashares and other community leaders were surprised the consortium offered to build the housing only to use the money for a soccer stadium. "How could I possibly be in a position to know that? It was so counter to the whole goal, and the community that we want to see," Brashares said.Brashares said that Santa Barbara Youth Soccer has been "disastrous" for many of its former youth soccer alumni. Some of them have committed suicide, Brashares said. (They have also lost millions of dollars in investments, including on the soccer team, Brashares said.)Bashares said she also was made aware that the consortium was planning to build the community park without first obtaining the approval of local communities which had approved the land use they wanted to use. The public, Brashares said, is owed accurate input into government decisions.The consortium declined to comment on the matter for this story.The proposal for a stadium is now dead. The owners of San Diego's USL team, Scorpions, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy last month and have not yet completed the stadium. Although the Chargers have expressed interest in bringing Los Angeles Chargers Stadium back to the San Diego area to play at Qualcomm Stadium at the University of California San Diego's La Jolla campus, that site is no longer on the table for the Chargers and could be occupied by the San Diego Zoo or City of Ontario or the San Diego State University.
It's not a perfect world, though. When a driver is on foot, a car always follows them. The cyclist, meanwhile, always has the right of way. What this means, says University of California Berkeley researcher Andrew Moore, is that pedestrians "have to behave in ways that are counterintuitive and counterintuitively dangerous". It's a tricky conundrum; one that has only increased over the past decade.Over the past six years alone, pedestrian deaths in the US have increased by 50%, according to a new report released today by the National Safety Council. The reason is, of course, the proliferation of big, boxy road designs with many parking spaces. The result is a perfect environment for people to speed and ignore traffic signals.While there's an abundance of information on bad-doing pedestrians, not much information exists on how dangerous they can be. As a result, Moore and several colleagues have set out to study such behaviour in a lab setting."Some people say it's impossible for people to drive 40 miles an hour on a bicycle," he said. "Other people say it's impossible for people to drive 80 miles an hour on a bicycle."To tackle how people drive safely around pedestrians, Moore and his colleagues at the California Institute of Technology and the University of San Francisco set up two groups of volunteers. One group walked at a comfortable pace, weaving out towards an oncoming car on either side. The other walked at a more relaxed pace, using hand signals to indicate when to cross when a car was in their path. As a result, the latter pair did the walking at much higher speeds.The researchers also recorded the times the cars in each carpool travelled. Then they put those figures into a computer modeling framework and simulated the behaviour of a car driver in each condition.The result showed that there were significant differences in the way people drove around cyclists on foot, although the two groups drove remarkably similarly."The way people drive on the road has changed dramatically," Jones said. "It's become more dangerous for drivers and pedestrians."Jones noted: "Although there might have always been a place for people who are physically unfit to ride bicycles, we may be going to a place where the physical fitness of cyclists is considered acceptable and where the physical fitness of non-cyclists cannot be justified."The other group of volunteers, meanwhile, spent a lot of time at their cruising speed rather than walking on the inside of a tight circle.As a result, the researchers found that people who did the most traffic-calming did the least road-faming. "In other words, the faster they drove, the likelier they were to do things that are dangerous for pedestrians," Jones explained."We're really only just beginning to understand these big cultural issues and how they are influencing public safety," he added.
A British man who said he was the victim of a hate crime is facing the possibility of prosecution in Pakistan and facing jail in Britain for his views.Mohammed Asghar, a former BBC Radio host who went on leave last December, was arrested two weeks ago by Pakistani authorities for insulting Islam, the BBC reported.A spokesman at the Inter Services Public Relations said the charges against Mr. Asghar were under "a law making criticism of religious leaders an act of blasphemy." Mr. Asghar said in a BBC interview last week that he had not been notified of the charge.The Pakistani government has also sought to impose harsh penalties on people who insult Sufi saints, a group that has long been under attack in that country. The group's followers are typically accused of being involved in criminal activity.When asked about the case, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Washington said that Mr. Asghar "was arrested on 16 May for his views on free speech."Last year, a Pakistani court sentenced a Christian woman to death for allegedly posting blasphemous content on Facebook."When we make comments and try and understand the religion of others, we have to be very careful," Mr. Asghar told the BBC. "What I have been threatened with is that I am being accused of trying to insult religion because I tried to understand a little bit more about this faith in a way I found most interesting."Mr. Asghar was detained for almost two days by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs when he went on leave. His lawyers have filed emergency court applications for bail pending the decision by a local judge, the BBC reported.In the interview on BBC Radio, Mr. Asghar said he would never leave Pakistan."I'm not in any way leaving the country," he told the news organization. "I have no intention of leaving the country."Mr. Asghar said he intended to move freely in Pakistan after his release from Pakistani authorities because he planned to go onto a lecture tour to promote his book, "The Muslim Inquisition," as well as engage in social action, the BBC reported, citing unnamed Pakistani security officials involved in the case."It would not make any difference to me in the last sense or shape whether I was jailed or not," Mr. Asghar said.
In a decision that may lead to a wider rift in NATO with the US, the European Union on Friday announced it would hold a new, more prominent meeting of EU foreign ministers, this time in Brussels, in October.Speaking at a special meeting of the UN Security Council in New York last month, US Secretary of State John Kerry said that the US and other NATO allies had increased its military presence in countries bordering Russia, in particular as Moscow increased its military intervention in neighboring Ukraine. He also warned that any attempts to destabilize the Ukraine and Russia from outside the borders of the three countries could trigger a military response.US Vice President Joe Biden also recently said that the US is considering deploying "small, tactical nuclear weapons to Europe." This is the case, he has maintained, as Russian forces had been occupying Ukraine's Crimea peninsula during the protests that ousted Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich.While there have been reports that the US plans to make further arms purchases from NATO members while the situation in Ukraine remains highly volatile, one EU decision is likely to have a more significant impact.In his speech to parliament on Thursday, British Prime Minister David Cameron said that he was calling for a new NATO summit for 2017, a meeting that he predicted would be more important in Europe's security concerns, but more controversial in the east of the alliance."I think a strong NATO is more important in Europe's future," Cameron had said.In the US, Secretary Kerry, who has been one of the more vocal advocates in Washington of increasing NATO defense spending, and Defense Secretary Ashton Carter, who has been the most vocal proponent of the Pentagon's plans to beef up presence in Eastern Europe – despite Washington's objections over Moscow's actions in Ukraine – both urged European leaders to join the NATO-led military bloc.The US is currently considering whether to conduct a military exercise at some point in the near future, but that may be delayed until 2017, according to NATO commander James Cartwright. "Right now, we are just focused on preparing for this meeting of our foreign ministers," Cartwright explained on Thursday.Some EU leaders have expressed opposition to the recent meeting of the NATO-Russia Council, held in April, which allowed for some discussion of non-NATO members' defense issues, and other meetings that NATO has held for years with its European allies.EU officials, including French Prime Minister Manuel Valls and Greek Foreign Minister Nikos Kotzias, on Thursday called for the NATO-Russia Council to be scrapped, saying that it allowed countries with non-NATO defense commitments to "interfere" with NATO's plans.Last month, the NATO-Russia Council held a plenary session in Brussels, but its sessions have been held on a different date each year since 2000, when Moscow came under pressure from Russia's neighbors over the annexation of Crimea. The NATO-Russia Council was launched as a way to help coordinate NATO's defense of its member countries, including NATO-allied states.The most recent NATO defense ministers' meeting took place last September in Brussels but was limited to NATO policy and defense spending.
We're big fans of the "Star Wars: The Force Awakens" and we loved the film's stunning visuals as well. But the visual wonder doesn't go unnoticed. For a variety of reasons, film critics have taken a break from making movies to start looking at the original "Star Wars" trilogy again.One of the best aspects of the series' prequel films was how they created a sense of scale using practical models from the special effects company Industrial Light and Magic for both visual and film effects (yes, "The Force Awakens" used ILM assets). For example, the Ewok village you see in "A New Hope" is almost the size of a city block.That same style of scale also shows up here — particularly in the Tatooine landscape. In many respects, George Lucas' Star Wars: Episode IV — A New Hope — is a prequel to the more modern "Star Wars" movies, and we thought the Tatooine scene from "The Force Awakens" was one of the best and most memorable. But in 2015, this exact scene has to be seen to be believed."Star Wars: The Force Awakens," which opens Dec. 18, also stars John Boyega (Attack the Block), Daisy Ridley (The Force Awakens), Adam Driver (The Force Awakens), Oscar Isaac (Inside Out), Lupita Nyong'o (12 Years a Slave), Gwendoline Christie (Game of Thrones), Domhnall Gleeson (Marvel's The Avengers), Anthony Daniels, Peter Mayhew and Kenny Baker.Here are three reasons to see "Star Wars: The Force Awakens" now:1. The best special effectsYes, George Lucas' original "Star Wars" films were awesome. But his special effects also were. In fact, one of the best aspects of "A New Hope" is how it looks so authentic in appearance when comparing it to real-life miniature models. Take a look at this sequence.Here, we see some of the original miniature models used in "A New Hope." We also see the original "Star Wars" Millennium Falcon with the original ship models from three different eras. And finally, we see one of the original Mos Eisley Cantina sets for Jabba the Hutt where Luke made his first meet before his fateful rescue of Han Solo and Chewbacca.To put all of that together in space is a marvel of effects.2. The Tatooine scene from "A New Hope""The Force Awakens" starts in Tatooine and shows the entire planet before moving to the desert planet of Tatooine. For our money, that scene in the sand is up there in the top three "Star Wars" scenes. It just looks so authentic with such great acting and visual effects work, you don't even realize how big "A New Hope" is. (A little trivia: The Tatooine sand planet wasn't always called Tatooine — it was called "Eden" in early versions of the film.)Here's how we made that scene so believable:At the desert planet, the Millennium Falcon flies right over the sand dunes and into a tall dune, with the camera slowly dropping down — to where we see Luke and his companions walking around a cliff side. If the audience could have been any closer to Luke, he would've seen all the rocks on the ground.A few seconds later, the camera drops again and we see the camera and Luke walk through tall dunes and onto an outdoor set. We see a huge building and Luke looks around as if he's looking for a new set. It all leads us into an epic space battle.As cool as this "Star Wars: The Force Awakens" scene is, the desert of Tatooine is just a bit too small. The best time to see this scene is at the very end of the film when Luke gets into his new ship. If you can, jump on the Millennium Falcon in a moment when the camera slowly drops and when you are on the outside of the ship, the shot is fantastic.3. The original TatooineThe first time you see Tatooine, it's the most alien looking place in the "Star Wars" universe. But with only one visit, you soon learn that this location became an iconic place in science fiction and comicbook culture as well.There's so much history buried within the landscape. Before "Star Wars" was even conceived, a movie was already titled "A New Hope" because a film company wanted something more to set the stage for a story that would be "Star Wars." The name "A New Hope" eventually became a trademark of Lucasfilm so that's why it is in the "Star Wars" universe for the last 35 years. The film company also purchased the rights for an "Arena Earth" version of Tatooine for the Star Wars Holiday Special, but that
The European Central Bank on Monday unexpectedly removed one of the main restrictions that had been holding back a massive scheme by the US Federal Reserve to buy unlimited amounts of bonds from banks around the world.By removing the cap on the amount of bonds it can buy, the ECB, which has been trying to boost the economy amid a deepening political crisis in Greece, can now use the money to buy up to $65bn (£45bn) in bonds each month to prevent money from flying offshore and to support the local economy.The US Fed launched its bond-purchase programme to spur an economic recovery, which is faltering in Europe. It is meant to inject $85bn a month into the US financial system. A central bank official said they had received "encouraging" feedback on their bond-lending programme from a number of financial institutions in Europe, including German banks.
On Tuesday's edition of the radio talk show "The Rush Limbaugh Show," Rush Limbaugh blamed President Obama for an attack on a military training camp in Niger.Limbaugh called it an "act of war" by the Obama administration. His guests on the show all agreed, claiming there was "no way" the attack was not a result of U.S. involvement.Limbaugh said, "These are men that have, for years, been sent up there by the Pentagon to patrol in these villages and guard against these terrorists. And these are men that we're helping. We've given them some boots on the ground. We've sent them on missions. We've put them in close proximity to these villages. It's a real question: Was this a mistake of a mission that was not handled properly in the way we should be? And that's the question I really want to explore. Are we putting ourselves in danger? Are we being outgunned? And it's a huge question. It's a great question, the question for the press, the press should be asking: Is this a deliberate operation? Has this been done before?"After the first half-hour Limbaugh said, "It is an act of war. I think we have had several military operations, I think we're up to 11 of them in the past few years, and all of them either involved U.S. forces in action or the U.S. was attacked, because it's a war that doesn't end, if the United States, or the West, attacks a sovereign nation. I think we have gone into many more wars during this presidency, and I think all of them, without exception, have been, in one way or another, an effort, a war. And it's an act of war when a country attacks its allies, when the people of another country are attacked, no matter how unjustified those attacks are. We had this on our side in Iraq, we saw that on our side a lot in Libya, as well … I don't think we're going to have a clean shot of a clear case of an act of war. We saw that in Iraq during the "Vietnam Syndrome." We had it for a while, unfortunately, with this act of terrorism. But I think one of the reasons why this is a war, is because the people that are being attacked are our own men, because they're our allies, have given us some of their lives, some of the most dangerous work they can do for us. And they are under attack."Rush Limbaugh said, "This is an act of war on every level, and it really ought to be considered an act of war. There isn't any rational way to look at the case, where Niger goes into the fight, then the U.S. government goes in and says, 'Well, we're there to help with intelligence, to help track down the terrorists, to protect our troops from attack…' Then you have a country like Niger that turns down the offer, and you have another country like Burkina Faso that takes it and is attacked. Then you have a country like Cameroon that takes it, and then you're attacking a third country, Niger, to fight back a terrorist group. What did they do before this? Did they help the United States track down the terrorists? Did they help protect our troops? No, they attacked our government to do so, and they continue to do that, they don't give up, and that's the issue."Limbaugh concluded: "Look, we have a president who's waging a war of choice, and our guys are getting killed. The Pentagon has been sending, have sent, thousands of men in this country, and they're still being killed. We're being attacked and being attacked all around the world. We are fighting a war with these terrorists, and I believe that it has to be considered an act of war, and I believe that if you're going to go down this path, if you're going to go down this route, if you want to talk about the question of an act of war, then this is a war, so what exactly is this place in Niger, what is this nation, and who is the group that we're defending? And if you just say, 'It's Al Qaeda, because that was the first thing that came up,' it can't be an act of war. You can't just be attacked for no reason. We have to understand how we're being attacked, in order for this to really be an objective act of war."
The FBI on Wednesday released a statement regarding the investigation into alleged election interference by Russian officials, saying that "there is no indication to suggest that Secretary Clinton's personal emails were compromised by hostile actors.""As part of its ongoing investigation, on January 22, 2016, the FBI asked the Department of State for the assistance of the former Secretary of State's personal email server," FBI Director James B. Comey said in a statement. "While that assistance wasn't required under the Freedom of Information Act, we nonetheless asked for and obtained the assistance of the Department of State in order to assist in our assessment. In response, the Department of State determined that some of Clinton's emails were indeed work-related, although they did not contain classified material at the time they were sent."Comey added that there "wasn't prosecutable criminal activity here, but the FBI is reviewing all of the relevant evidence in order to determine whether it presents a prosecutable case.""On the whole, I think it was quite unusual and the Director was aware of that," said David Kendall, a former State Department counselor under Clinton who is now a partner at Williams & Connolly in Washington's D.C. lobbying community.At the time, Kendall told ThinkProgress that Clinton only had one email address — "hdr22@clintonemail.com" — so the FBI wouldn't know whether it was the same server and server logs would not be able to track activity or logs would have had to be searched at some point. (Kendall also said that when Clinton used her BlackBerry, she sent and received emails using AppleMail.com.)Kendall said it is "very unusual" to have only "one address to use" for a server, because it means a server can't be monitored from the outside.But since the server would have been monitored at all times, said Kendall, it's not unusual that it could not be monitored at all times."To have a server like this set up and not have the server monitored is pretty extraordinary," he added, noting that there was some concern that the server would be hacked at some point in the future.AdvertisementIn a hearing on Tuesday, Comey confirmed that there were not specific indications that the server itself or Clinton's email account itself had been hacked or that Clinton and her staffers' use of email was an attempt to skirt transparency laws."This is a person who was not allowed to use a State Department email address or to have a State Department email address," Comey said in response to a question from Senator Ron Johnson (R-WI).According to Comey, Clinton "used her personal email extensively while outside the United States for official business, including sending and receiving work-related emails in the territory of sophisticated adversaries." This included emailing her husband and senior Clinton staff with a note about the latest situation in the Middle East, Comey said, but did not explicitly say that she emailed them using her private server.Comey's testimony made clear, however, that there was a "reasonable basis to believe" that foreign intelligence officials were trying to gain access to the personal email account, as well as the server Clinton used to host it.The FBI also uncovered "over 1,000 emails in 52 email chains — 14 of which were to or from Clinton herself — that were not part of any previously reviewed messages" because, according to Comey, "the metadata did not definitively indicate they were not already part of the group of 30,000 that were returned by Secretary Clinton to State in 2014." This included "a number of chains with other Secretary Clinton's aides, including Cheryl Mills but also Heather Samuelson and Huma Abedin."Comey did not say whether the use of private email to conduct State Department business was a felony.However, Clinton's use of the server could very well have been a criminal offense. As PolitiFact noted, the law prohibiting mishandling of classified information would have had to be broken to get Clinton in trouble. That means Clinton — and not her staff — could have been sent to jail for such an offense, just by using a private email address with the highest level of protection: State Department's. Moreover, this is a crime to which the Department of Justice has indicated it is willing to prosecute."If you look at the statute, this is clearly a felony," said Adam Schiff, a senior Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee who has frequently criticized Comey — and the FBI — for his handling of the case. "The problem is they have put out a memo that makes it seem like she had no criminal intent. That may very well be the position of the Justice Department — that this was all inadvertent. Now, that's a very questionable distinction. They can argue that the statute's unclear, so they can't point to a specific intent. But if you look at the history of these laws, they've tended to be narrow," Schiff noted."
I am a huge fan of the video games, movie and tv series "The Simpsons", especially the second and third season; I have been collecting them since the days of the Atari 8 bit computer. I have bought all my Simpsons memorabilia from E-bay over the years and I would consider myself, an "Sideshow Collectibles "or as the kids would say, "The Simpsons Collectors"!This particular piece is my favorite. This is the only one of the Simpsons Collectors that I know to have the original, non-sleeve, vinyl covered version of that episode, and it is from the original 1993 release. I would have paid a lot of money to be able to have that one, not only for it's amazing history but for the story it tells.The Simpsons "Treehouse of Horror XX" is the first episode from that edition of the show, and it features Bart (voiced by a character by the name of Mr. Smithers) as a ghost that is haunting Springfield. In The Simpsons "Treehouse of Horror XX" he is called "Mr S.", and he has a very odd relationship with Springfield's current Mayor Quimby and the current town clerk, Mrs. McCallister. He has a habit of singing the song "I Am a Ghost" as the entire town, and is considered by Mr. Smithers as the "greatest living living ghost", and it is due to this, his desire to see a ghost that keeps him as he is, that he is considered the "greatest living ghost"The episode begins with a short musical sequence as the Simpsons gather around a microphone in the living room of the Simpson's mansion as the "Mr. S." begins singing a familiar song as the song, "I Am a Ghost," plays.There are a few scenes from this episode that we don't see (at least not that we see), but they are very effective, and it shows that while "The Simpsons" is a kids show it also has dark elements, and is no laughing matter just as a matter of fact, and just as some of the things we laugh at the moment, some of us might think of one of these. The scenes include:Mr. Smithers singing "A Ghost Is Born" to the ghost of a girl whose grandmother is killed after being buried in the town cemeteryThe ghost of a boy who is murdered because he sees a girl's leg in the closet, and he screams to get her to runMrs. McCallister standing up to the ghost of a girl who was raped by her fatherMr. Smithers' ghost playing the guitar and singing The Rolling Stones, "Sympathy for the Devil."Mr. Smithers' ghost, a man who is blind, who becomes upset that he can't see the beautiful young woman who haunts the Simpsons family homeIn a small scene (I believe it took about 15 seconds) Homer is on the phone with an old, fat, bald man, and the two are discussing life, one who is living, the other who is dead, both of which have lived thousands of years, and their opinions on life.The most haunting, and the weirdest, part of this episode is when Springfield is hit by a blackout. The blackness is so bright in this episode that it actually seems to illuminate the Simpsons family's home, so that the entire building seems to glow. This is not really seen except for the brief second of this episode when Bart is looking for the light switch, when there is a sudden flash of light and the Simpsons family's house appears to be illuminated. Later, this effect occurs again while Bart looks into the TV, and the Simpsons' home is illuminated by darkness as Homer and Marge watch it. The scene repeats several times, especially when the Simpsons move onto the streets during a snow storm, and then again during a blizzard.In this episode, Bart becomes so angry when a girl who says she is a ghost runs into the bushes that he throws a piece of wood out the window and then punches the glass. In the next scene Bart is holding his belly from the pain of the pain he was in earlier. He is holding his belly because of the intense pain he has suffered. He is screaming so loud when he screams because his stomach hurts so bad, he can't hold his breath. He is in extreme pain, and he cries, when he is in this way. And this is a very good sign, because he will be suffering terribly in the next scene when he returns to Springfield. He will be dead in the next scene because he was born that way.Later in the scene, it becomes impossible to see Bart's head, but from the side he looks like he is floating and his mouth is open wide.The next scene shows an elderly Mrs. Burns with the dead man, who she believes is her son, who is dead
The government has taken another step to make the Internet service providers (ISPs) liable for illegal Internet content on their networks, this time by adding another clause to the Information Technology Amendment Act, 2002. This new provision has been included to the list of "technical and commercial rights" that ISPs are already bound by to prevent the sharing of pornographic content on their networks.For many years, we have watched the telecom companies and ISPs in India be brought to heel by court orders and by the POTA Act, 2008. On December 18, 2002, the Supreme Court defined "obscene material," and a series of judicial orders directed service providers to block websites carrying such content. But the Internet was slow in coming. Until now.With the insertion of this new clause, which was included in the IT Act, the government is taking another step towards making the ISPs liable for the illegal sharing of pornographic content, if they host sites carrying such content on their networks. This clause has long been sought after by porn companies to prevent the service providers from being held responsible for the content contained on their networks.The new clause will now apply to websites containing any "obscene or pornographic material" that is not "prohibited under law." The clause, as many have pointed out, will also include "non-commercial information and communication services," and the IT Act provides for a broad range of liability for such content without making this clear whatsoever.A senior official told DNA, "This clause will be made applicable to any Internet Service Provider, including those that host websites which are either 'obscene' or 'pornographic' in nature. This is not intended to go in against the PTA. It will only cover material on ISPs which they host such websites using their infrastructure."One of the concerns expressed by the sex industry (as well as by civil society organisations and lawyers) has been that the clause in the IT Act allows for a "safe harbour" clause, allowing the ISPs to escape liability for the content they host, if it is not "commercially reasonable."The new clause, however, is expected to extend the safe harbour to content "obscene" without specifying why such content should be viewed as obscene, and it may be further expanded through amendments to the IT Act. This is likely to be discussed during the monsoon session of Parliament (beginning April 24).It is worth mentioning that the PTA itself also specifies liability under the IT Act for "promoting the commission [of] offences" by service providers — that is, any websites that facilitate the transmission or distribution of such content.The government has also added another provision, aimed at protecting the privacy of ISPs. A new clause in the IT Act, 2002, provides for "reasonable measures undertaken to ensure the confidentiality of information relating to its users that is disclosed to any law enforcement or security authority or any judicial, administrative or public body." The clause was introduced, without a peep in the Supreme Court or any other court, in response to a complaint filed by the Electronic Citizens' Forum (ECF), a citizen advocacy organisation. It had challenged some sections of the Information Technology Act, which granted powers to the IT Ministry to set up privacy boards, which were appointed by the Ministry and responsible for monitoring, sanctioning and monitoring the use of personal information by service providers. The ECF had argued that the privacy board was not fit to meet the task because it needed to set up an internal system to store and monitor data, rather than relying on IT service providers to do this.But in January, 2008, the Supreme Court ordered that it be set up with the assistance of the Law Commission of India. However, the Privacy Board's mandate expired on December 31, 2009, and the Ministry has asked the Law Commission, after considering the ECF's suggestion, to recommend a new way of interpreting the Privacy Board's mandate, according to the PTI.Also, in April 2011, ECF had brought a public interest litigation or PIL in the High Court of Delhi which sought enforcement of the Right on Record Act and Privacy Orders passed in 2004, the privacy provisions of which were also not mentioned specifically in the IT Act.Poonam Singh, a lawyer and senior researcher with the Internet Society told DNA about one of the reasons why the government has given the Internet service providers the freedom to decide which rules to follow and which not. "The telecom companies are in favour of keeping internet content outside their domain. They want to control everything that happens online. But the courts, in their wisdom, are protecting privacy and freedom on the Net. So they are fighting to keep this power — it has to be kept secret. To that end, it's better to have these clauses put into the bill to make it clear to them that they are not free to make these decisions themselves. If you can't agree with the regulator, you can't just put in your own rules for it to follow. You need to get some oversight."
You're Not Good EnoughThe only way you learn to become an outstanding leader and manager of people is by trying things; failures, successes and successes. But sometimes it doesn't go as well as you'd hoped. Maybe some people need to take a few extra classes before they can really take to the team; that's great too! The problem is that when you're trying something new and challenging and you fail, you often feel that, "I'm not good enough."But why? How does it feel to have this self-doubt? Is the feeling of being unqualified just a product of not trying enough? Or does it have to do with who you are?For the last 7+ years I've been teaching leadership and leadership skills to over 2 million people through my courses on Leadership for Life (LFL), Leadership in a Changing World (LW), and Leadership Training Courses (LTC), all developed by the best leadership coaching agency in the USA. My course to leaders in your 60s and over is one of the most popular courses we deliver. In that course, I talk about why you are not a leader, and how to overcome it, so that you can become a leader.Why It is So HardThe truth is that there is some reason why it can feel like you're not good enough — because I don't think you're. That's why it is so important to really understand what it is that's stopping you, and then find a better way to get there. Some of the reasons you might be lacking are as follows:Your backgroundSome people might have the advantage of having strong work ethics in their past that makes them comfortable in the role of leader. Maybe you've had a great teacher before, or a family member that can show you how to lead and motivate others. In these cases, you can become an expert leader while not having to have a ton of leadership experience or skills.And on the flip side, you could have strong values and morals in your past that prevent you from being a good leader. Maybe your grandparents instilled deep moral values in you that made you feel that you can't really be a good leader. The way to overcome this is to understand the difference between your own personal values and those of others. If you feel you don't really understand people or have the strength to be a team player, then you've got to get help!You know what? You're going to have to get over the shame associated with being unqualified, and just be yourself. You know how you were when you were 30-something? Okay, that has changed…I'd suggest you get out there and find a mentor, an advisor, or even the best manager you can find.LivesIt's important to know there are other people that can be your leader and mentor. In fact, there is nothing wrong with being interested in other people…that's what makes us human. For some people, it makes sense to have someone in their life to be their mentor at the same time they build a successful career.This is just another reason why we teach leadership training at various career stages. It's important for you and your future colleagues to be able to work well together with other leaders in your professional, professional family, or your personal life. If you're going to have a group of people in your life, then it's important that you find someone you'd want to become their mentor.Personal GoalsYou've got to understand what your personal goals are. What do you want to become? What's your personal calling? It might sound weird for a business coach to be talking about your personal goals, but it is a critical part of your growth and learning. Once you've got this part figured out, everything else will fall in place.There are certainly times when we just need a little reminder, or someone to push us further as we work. Maybe it's from mentors, parents, coaches or your spiritual leader; all of these can help you find new insights and be motivated to be better.LivesThe key to leadership training is to find a way for yourself and your team to see the success they can have together. It helps if it's something tangible, like improving work flow and efficiency. But you can also find success by setting small and achievable goals. Maybe you'd like to improve your organizational efficiency by eliminating the office printer; or you want to grow your group by 2-3, then you could set something that gets you closer to 10. When you get started, you have to be realistic – do some research and think about what will make a significant difference for you or your team.But here is why being realistic isn't the same as over-promising …Over-promising will get rid of the pressure, but it will never get you closer to the goals you set out to accomplish. So what can you
PASADENA, Calif. — Engineers from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) have developed a new material that could be useful for creating supercapacitors: a porous porous carbon material. Researchers with JPL and their colleagues at MIT report on their work today in the open-access journal Materials Letters.A supercapacitor is a device that stores a high voltage or electricity for long times in a power-hungry device, and is able to discharge that stored power quickly. Currently, the only materials available to produce such a device are carbon, silicon and metal—all of them highly reactive and expensive materials.The JPL-MIT material is made of carbon fibers in an array that can be tuned to suit a variety of applications. In this case, scientists tested how the carbon-fiber-in-carbon-fiber array responds to the flow of electric current. The porous materials are porous because they're covered by a fluid that forms inside them. The fluid can be a gel, a gel solution, or even water."When you're trying to build an electronic device, it's important that the device operate in an environment where it can deliver a large amount of power and has no resistance," said JPL's Peter Oesch, a member of one of the collaborating groups. "A porous material like this can be used as both a cathode and an electrolyte, while also being able to supply both power and current to a device." The porous carbon material could be a way to make more efficient supercapacitors, he said, potentially reducing the amount of energy it takes to charge a battery.In this work, scientists tested the voltage-capacity characteristics of the carbon material as a supercapacitor. As the current flowed through it, the voltage-capacity (and thus power) of the carbon material increased. The material could also operate like a lithium-ion battery—if researchers tuned the pH levels in the fluid. Porous carbon can be made acidic or basic. When the material is acidic, the cells can charge faster. Conversely, they run inefficiently when it's basic. This is likely because the acidic water doesn't carry electrons as well, since the material is negatively charged."Basically, we're studying an electrochemical property of the material: when the conductive components become basic, that's when the material can actually provide good current in a power-hungry device," said JPL's Oesch.The research was funded and supported by NASA and the Air Force Office of Scientific Research and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. JPL is a division of the California Institute of Technology. MIT is a nonprofit institution that supports world-changing research.

SALT LAKE CITY — This year's presidential election in both the U.S. and India is expected to be a heated contest, with both candidates seeking to capitalize on the strong global economic and political situation.With more than 50 million Americans and 2.5 billion Indians who are engaged in the global economy, both candidates have been actively building their campaigns with an eye toward both foreign policy and domestic issues.As the first post-Cold War election with an active center-left and center-right candidate, both candidates have focused their attention on foreign policy issues, including the war in Afghanistan, Iran's nuclear agenda, Russia, and Russia's aggression against eastern Ukraine. India has also been a focus of the campaign, with both candidates making strong claims about U.S. foreign policy.Trump supporters, with little international experience or policy expertise, have largely remained in the background during the campaign, especially with regard to domestic issues.Clinton supporters, on the other hand, have come out to play in the political arena with extensive experience in government, with the exception of U.S. foreign policy."In the general election, Clinton and Trump will face off in debates focusing largely on foreign policy. However, many of the issues they will discuss are local to the region. For instance, both candidates have called for greater access to Indian markets and a boost in U.S. defense cooperation with India," explained Robert Tuchman, founder and managing director of American Diplomacy, Inc. His company's website describes its mission: "American Diplomacy is an economic security consultancy providing strategic consulting and policy advice to foreign and domestic entities to help them protect their assets, grow their economies, and remain a strategic partner to the United States. As the world's top trading partner with India and second largest investor, we help our clients leverage U.S. trade, investment and military agreements to protect their wealth and expand their market reach."On the campaign trail, both candidates have spoken to their support for India's economic growth and its contribution to the global economy, arguing that India stands to benefit significantly from the strong economic and political growth in the U.S.A number of prominent Republican voices in the party have also spoken out in support of India in this election, citing strong economic opportunity for the U.S. and strong and stable relations with India.Trump, for example, highlighted his support for India in his April 16 presidential statement in which he called on the U.S. to continue its "peaceful and friendly role" and "to increase investment to our country." He also pointed to other American companies that have invested in India — such as Intel — and called upon them to increase their investments in India.He also called on the U.S. to work with India to find a negotiated peace in Kashmir, which has seen a wave of unrest since a separatist leader was killed in an encounter with Indian security personnel in July. Clinton, on the other hand, has been outspoken about U.S. policy on Kashmir. In February of this year, for example, while campaigning for her presidential bid, Clinton called for "restoring strategic access" to Kashmir, in addition to maintaining U.S. support for India's membership in the nuclear weapons club.When a recent Newsweek article highlighted India-U.S. relations, Clinton cited her experience as chair of the U.S.-India joint commission on civil nuclear cooperation in 2005, noting that her work "was the most important factor in making India a great partner for U.S. industry and in turning the clock back on nuclear testing.""And what that really means is not just a more secure environment and energy security for both of our countries, which is a huge positive, but it means that we are both more in sync and more aligned on national security," she declared.Clinton has also spoken out about the issue of Kashmir. In May this year, for example, Clinton went on record to support Indian efforts for an independent Kashmir state. India views Kashmir as an integral part of its territory. However, India asserts that the state does not exist in legal terms, and that its people in Kashmir enjoy self-determination.In August, during a trip to India, Clinton went so far as to say that Kashmir, like Tibet, is "inseparable from the larger issues at stake in the broader relationship.""We need to continue to work together to ensure that Kashmir's legitimate interests are advanced. And we must make the security of India and peace in that region a priority, no matter where that work takes us," Clinton said."Both candidates have emphasized economic development. In addition, their respective economic platforms outline various policies that promote economic opportunities for middle-class Americans," explained Tuchman. "Both candidates have also mentioned the importance of boosting exports to India. Neither candidate's platform reflects any serious policy discussion about the role and future of India's trade deficits."Trump, while campaigning
"I was very surprised. I couldn't do it," he said. "You always think you know what you're doing when you get in the cockpit," said Cammisa. However, he said that when the simulator did not work for any reasons, he knew to expect that. "I felt that something was not right in the simulation, but I didn't know."
Catherine Zeta-Jones has been revealed as the first woman to play a prominent female villain in a Marvel Studios movie.Zeta-Jones, best known for her role in 1995's The Breakfast Club, is set to play Malekith, a villain in the upcoming Thor: Ragnarok.The character is first seen at the end of The Avengers: Age Of Ultron, where she takes over Asgard for the first time. However, Malekith had previously only been hinted at in Avengers: Age Of Ultron, voiced by Chris Hemsworth.Zeta-Jones will be starring in the film as well, alongside Tessa Thompson, Tom Hiddleston, and Idris Elba.Marvel's Marvel Studios are currently shooting the sequel to Ant-Man and will be releasing Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 2 on August 1.
This year marks the 20th anniversary of the release of Super Smash Bros. Melee, Nintendo's iconic arcade fighting game. To celebrate this milestone in gaming history, we have compiled some interesting information, stats and trivia about the beloved game that will put a smile on your face. Find out what your favorite characters used to be, why the original Final Destination was so terrible, and why Yoshi wasn't able to make the cut.Also Read: 10 Best Super Smash Bros. Characters of All Time5. Melee was the first game in Japan to include two-player co-op, making it a rare exception in the West.Yoshi used to be Yoshi.You'd be hard-pressed to find a game with this much co-op. One on one mode is rare on consoles, especially multiplayer games. Nintendo didn't bother making the change for North America and Europe however, because the game was so popular. For a game with eight characters, you would've expected Melee to be just as balanced as Brawl, but as you can see in this video, just about everyone can play together.4. Many characters did not make the cut for Melee.A little less than half of the original roster made the cuts, although the roster got a little bit larger thanks to a number of fan favorites reappearing. While only two characters in Melee were playable at the same time, the game was also notorious for leaving behind characters it considered too weak to be worth the effort to create. Here's a breakdown of how many characters were considered strong, weak or nonexistent in this Nintendo Smash Bros. biography.3. Melee featured three tiers, but that was a mistake.The concept of tiers in competitive games has always had a deep meaning in the fighting game community and Melee was no different. The game only featured two tiers, between the "heavyweights" and "lightweights," although the name "tier list" is a bit of misnaming. Players could fall into each of these categories and still have a chance to win.2. Melee added a character, Peach. Not even Mario got a character this quickly!Puff's new look was inspired by the Super Mario character.If only Peach had a chance to be the first character in the history of our beloved game… The story of Peach's inclusion has a bit of a fairy tale twist because Nintendo actually wanted to add another character. Nintendo employee and designer Mr. Fujioka, who was a big Mario fan, designed Peach. The rest is history and now Peach is the third best character.1. Yoshi was a popular character.As Nintendo's mascot, Yoshi was actually one of the more popular characters in Smash Bros. He was able to win by simply being in the game, but that didn't help his popularity. Yoshi's popularity was the main reason why the game was able to stay popular after all this time.Mario's popularity is not affected by the character being a clone.When it came to Smash Bros., Luigi was the king.With Super Mario Bros. 2 and Mario Party for the Super Nintendo, Mario is a franchise that dominated the gaming industry. Mario's status as the best character in games was cemented in the early 1990s when he was introduced as a clone, not just because of his look, but the game's mechanics."Mario was really hard to make a successful clone of," Sakurai says. "So to achieve good level design, we had to create a completely new gameplay that would satisfy the fans and that would make them think, 'I liked that'. When he got into this role, it was like, 'Okay, he can be really strong or he can be really smart as well.' So that's how we were able to make a successful clone."Share This Video Facebook Twitter EMAILDid your favorite character make the cut or a favorite game was left out of this list?

If one ever needs proof that people are irrational and easily manipulated, Google's "Project Shield"—arguably the most far-reaching of its kind ever—should have been the smoking gun.The initiative, which aimed to collect information on its "exposed communities," was the brain child of the world's most powerful search engine, and the very same that has recently come under fire for its use of "real names" to hide online activity. Even with this, it has managed to collect billions of entries about "exposed" Google users, including emails, photos, Google Drive files, search histories, and other data about the Internet habits of hundreds of millions of people.The information collected about those people was then compiled and uploaded to Google's servers, where it was used by Google to "improve search and privacy" in general, while keeping the identities of their Google users secret, according to the Electronic Frontier Foundation.As Google began integrating with Internet service providers to expand its own content into the new Internet, Project Shield proved to be a boon to Google; ISPs that partnered with Google could offer more ad-friendly content within their networks and collect much more data on the behavior of their users. So, more power to Google.Except that one thing didn't seem to be working for Google: people still hated the project. When asked in September why he kept the project from becoming a real-world project, Larry Page, current CEO of Google, shrugged and told the Guardian:I haven't heard of anything like that. Because that would be crazy … We wouldn't want anything like this to happen… If you do anything of this kind and get a lot of positive feedback, who are you going to believe? Me? Or people that have nothing to do with you?The project was eventually canceled in favor of new tools intended for Internet companies like Google.What happened?The Project Shield fiasco isn't Google's first foray into privacy. The company's controversial data-collecting programs Prism and PRISM have come under fire for its spying of personal email communications, as well as the use of "smart" cameras, as detailed in The Guardian. Google, and to a much lesser extent others, have a lot of data about users, but much of it is limited, or not publicly-accessible: users are often asked to grant access to their Web browsing histories and search history to companies like Google.A separate report from The Washington Post indicates that more than a quarter of all searches carried out using Google were done with an anonymous proxy. This is one of the big reasons that Prism and PRISM are controversial: in many cases, users would be tricked into revealing personal information.Why did Google do this?Project Shield and Prism were both part of a broader strategy by the company to expand out into areas where it had previously been confined. As I discussed in a previous article about Google's privacy policies, Google has been experimenting with a new kind of data collection for some time now, including its partnership with telecommunications giants like Verizon and AT&T. Google has long maintained that the information it gathers is "transparent," but the company has never explained it more specifically.The company's policy on its data collection is, according to this 2013 post on the company's Transparency Report page, "Google doesn't sell your personal or other information. We don't share user information across Google services. And we never sell your information to 3rd parties for their marketing purposes unless you give us permission to." If you can't do that, why not make a project so you can use a public WiFi hotspot to read your emails while you're at home?But it wasn't just about expanding the scope of Google's privacy policies. The project in question is also notable for an element that the company has never explained: its use of "real names," or pseudonyms, for its users.Why do Google and Facebook do it?Real names are the norm in traditional media such as television and in daily conversation (and, yes, in online services, too). While it can make the process of communicating more natural (and less stressful), it also creates a unique barrier for people who do not own real names. In my role as a privacy advocate and writer, I have encountered numerous people who use pseudonyms, including my own friends.When I first started writing in the early days of the Web, I began using pseudonyms for some personal and professional posts. I have no idea how many people do this, but the number of users who do is very small. The vast majority of people, when asked about their real names, say they prefer pseudonyms. In fact, most people I know have adopted pseudonyms for their identity online, whether by choice or accident.But, while people may choose to use pseudonyms for private parts of life, they often use them to communicate with others online, not just with friends. For example, one of my
The first big day of the NFL Draft comes and goes, meaning teams are preparing for the upcoming season. With more and more young players entering the league, there is also a lot of opportunity to improve your personnel, especially in the secondary.There is a significant amount of talent up and down the NFL, with a few teams having a few players that have a high upside who will play immediate roles on the defensive side of the ball.The Miami Dolphins have several key guys they want to see develop, but in the draft the key was to select an offensive linemen with high upside. They have two of these guys who were available in the first round and they found them.For the first time since 2012, Miami Dolphins offensive lineman Laremy Tunsil was on the board for Miami in the first round of the NFL Draft. He will be facing competition from Alabama defensive tackle Da'Ron Payne.Payne will have to prove that he's worth a first-round pick, but the Dolphins felt that they didn't have a very high chance of drafting him in the first round in some mock drafts. Miami's scouting department went back and looked at players that had similar build to Payne. They found a few who fit what the Dolphins want to do.What the Dolphins are looking for is someone with a high ceiling. A player who can add another piece to their roster. Miami needs more offensive lineman who need the weight room and that can play. They are hoping that one of those players come out of the draft with the right mentality and attitude. They feel they did their homework on Payne and believe he'd fit under their mold quickly.With Tunsil and Payne in the first round, I don't expect either one to fall in the draft. If, after this draft, they have both become solid, NFL-grade players then they could take a risk on drafting them, but it would be hard for me to argue they make a mistake.The Dolphins draft classTunsil was still the first player that jumped off the board for the Dolphins. After making a good selection in this year's draft, and using the team's 2018 first round draft pick, the Dolphins may look to select another offensive lineman. There's no reason why they can't. Right now, they appear to be solid at three spots, but I could see them using that pick to address other needs such as defensive tackle, guard or outside linebacker.After making a pick in the first round, there's a good chance that the team will look to make one more, as they did at defensive tackle; when they took defensive tackle Randy Starks. However, it probably won't be this year. If they feel they can improve at another position they'll make another.Payne, a defensive tackle out of Alabama, was the fourth player on the Dolphins board. As mentioned previously, this was the only defensive lineman Miami selected in the first round. They had a plethora of players in the second round at all positions. Here is a quick review:Round 1, Pick 5 (3rd round) : Miami took offensive lineman Arie Kouandjio from Alabama. However, the Dolphins were high on Georgia offensive lineman Cameron Erving. Kouandjio will now get his chance to work on his technique at the Dolphins facility.: Miami took offensive lineman Arie Kouandjio from Alabama. However, the Dolphins were high on Georgia offensive lineman Cameron Erving. Kouandjio will now get his chance to work on his technique at the Dolphins facility. Round 2, Pick 21 (4th round): Miami took defensive end Dion Jordan. They traded up in the fourth round to select Jordan, but did not trade down.Miami took defensive end Dion Jordan.

"What are you doing, you filthy child?"That was the first time they'd said that to me. I was 15 years old at the time, with no money and no friends. My mom and her boyfriend had kicked me out of the house as punishment.My dad had given me only one choice: If I wanted to leave, I needed to move out of the house as soon as possible, and they wouldn't be giving me any help. At the time, I couldn't imagine what I'd do without him.It was the middle of October and the weather was getting close to freezing. The snowfall in our hometown is massive. We'd been living there since I was born.I had just gotten a job at a restaurant in town after failing an English test and being turned down by a couple of other restaurants. I was only getting $300 a month at my last job, and my mom and stepdad never paid for my schoolbooks or any of my textbooks.Still, I needed someplace to live. And I wanted a place that was close to school where I could get a job to build up my resume. They said it would be a difficult move, but that if I moved out quickly, they would help my mom and stepdad find me a new job and help pay my school fees and tuition so that I could start a new life.I walked across the hall from their house to their car, where I told them I was going to move out right away. They looked at me like I was crazy, but they didn't say any other words of reason. Then all of a sudden, they were punching me in the chest, like I was some kind of monster for wanting to leave.I dropped to the floor and rolled on the road. Then they just walked off. I just couldn't find them to follow them. They never came back that day.I don't get angry much, but I felt very afraid. I never fought back when they bullied or yelled. But that was the first time I had ever punched back because I didn't want to. I was afraid my parents would kill me. I didn't like going back, or getting kicked out of school. I was very hurt. I was in a very strange situation.I spent my nights in the house until they kicked me out. It wasn't a pleasant experience, and I was constantly looking over my shoulder as I slept, wondering if my parents were watching me. That's the way I felt for the majority of the summer. I wasn't sure if I would ever get a job.I spent my nights and weekends playing with my best friend, who lived nearby. I'd see him all the time, and he'd always be playing video games. Sometimes we'd work on video games together, until one time we broke up. After that, we never saw each other anymore.I was only 15, but it felt like a lifetime before I even considered a girlfriend. For two years, I didn't tell anyone that I was a girl. I didn't care, because girls weren't cool. At the university, there were girls on every campus. All I knew about them was that they were very tall and super skinny. I had no idea that any of them had breasts or other body parts or what their personalities were like.I was very lonely and alone, with nowhere to go, and no idea what to do. It's just not normal to go around pretending to be a boy, so I never even let my friends know how I really felt.One of my best friends from high school came to see me, just a week after dropping out of school. I was a little nervous on our first meeting, but eventually, I calmed down. I didn't know him that well, but we became friends instantly.Some people are very kind to me, and that is one of the reasons I am alive. Some of the other reasons are more personal. When I'm mad at my dad, I sometimes think he's trying to kill me. If I've got anything against him, I can't help being mad.People look at me like I'm an abnormal person. I can't help but wonder if they're right. I wonder if people think I'm mentally ill. To me, it is just part of being a girl.My last hope was my friend, who I didn't want to let down. I wanted him to love me unconditionally. I wanted him to treat me like an adult, without expecting me to be a perfect little princess.It was a long and hard journey to a happy ending. I would love to get some words from some people reading this. I want to hear about people like myself who, despite their situation, went on to lead happy and successful lives. Thanks for reading.I'd also like to tell you a story about how the last few
You can find the previous post here:http://www.lewrockwell.com/2013/06/01/no-soul-in-citizen-of-the-citizen-states/Some of you know me from my work on liberty movement websites, like the New American Renaissance (NAR) website. I wrote several articles, one of which was on the new Supreme Court Justice. He's a native of Connecticut, and went to Yale Law. This would make him a constitutional law professor. The article I wrote was titled "The New Supreme Court Justice Is a Radical Constitutional Realist."I wrote this article on May 10th, 2010, and you can download a PDF version of the article below. Most of the following is my opinion. In the article, I discuss how President Obama may be going to change the United States for the worse. That day is today.I also spoke about it in-depth on May 20, 2010, at the "Reignition of Liberty" symposium in Santa Fe, New Mexico. If you can't find the video (or it's already on Youtube), you can read my speech in its entirety here – "Reign of the Realists."It will be interesting to see where this new Supreme Court Justice fits on the political spectrum and what his views regarding law, government, and liberty will be.The question is: Is he a realist at all or a conservative? I don't have the answer to that question, but I do know my position.I have followed the Supreme Court since the days of Earl Warren, an idealist in the mold of Martin Luther King. The Warren Court was a major player in the legal battles against Jim Crow laws, desegregation, abortion, gay marriage, and racial segregation. These court cases were the foundation of the modern civil rights movement.In the late 20th century, they became less concerned with the needs of the people versus the needs of the government. The Warren court was focused on the legal rights of individuals, not the rights of the nation as a whole.By the 1960s, Warren was out and was replaced by Chief Justice Earl Warren, Jr., who came to hold the role of a statesman much as Richard Nixon came to hold the American Presidency. The new Chief Justice was less a conservative than a democrat. His decisions in the landmark case of Brown v. Board of Education and the equal protection case of Roe v. Wade were the starting point for the post-racial society.I have watched Earl Warren and Richard Nixon since they were young men.I don't think I would vote for Barack Obama, but I do think he might be a "liberal president".Now, let's look at this new Justice.I should probably mention that in this post I have nothing but my personal opinion, and I don't claim to be a constitutional scholar. What I will say is based on my personal observations, based on my work in liberty movement websites, and my research on the subject.The New Supreme Court Justice Is a Radical Constitutional RealistIn his writings, the new Chief Justice has gone about explaining why the constitution of the United States is different than the constitution of any other country. In an April 22, 2005 op-ed article, he wrote:When I read the constitution of the other 98 countries represented on the United Nations Security Council, each country includes its citizens as members of society. The same is true in the United States. Citizenship is an inalienable right of every human being. . . . In the United States, we understand that every individual, regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, religion, marital status, or sexual orientation, is equal before the law, as well as that of the state. Citizenship is an inalienable natural right of all human beings, who by nature are equal in dignity and as such have the same interests in maintaining and protecting the country.This is what I believe. I will discuss it more in the next section.Now, the "inalienable natural right of all human beings, who by nature are equal in dignity and as such have the same interests in maintaining and protecting the country" part is rather tricky. There are three problems, three points of contention, that I find.1. The Chief Justice said that all individuals, regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, religion, marital status, or sexual orientation, are equal before the law. How do we apply this to a race? What is going on with the "traditional" doctrine of racial equality? How can a person qualify if they are not white or a person of color? When do you get a black birth certificate? When when?2. There is no clear answer to the second problem. The Supreme Court recently ruled with regards to marriage. Does this mean that there is no such thing as discrimination based upon sexual orientation today?
A few years ago, it would have been unthinkable for a man to play an instrument like drums on TV. Today there are so many people who love playing drums on TV, it's hard to keep track of them. And while they sometimes perform as the world's favorite rock band, they also do a lot more other things, like play a lot of drums, teach drummers how to play, or even get paid for it. Check out this list of drummers who are working in their spare time and have gigs on TV.
POP CULTURE"You know what would be fucking great? If you actually said, 'Fuck you,' and walked away."– D.L. HughleyYou've spent the entire day, watching people's heads explode in front of you, and you've finally run out of the things to say. It's the day of the "Faces With No Names" exhibition—a series of nude portraits in which people are photographed from the shoulders up.There's nothing particularly striking about your physique—you're just in the midst of an exercise routine, which you've been doing for the past two weeks in the basement of your friend's place in the Upper West Side.You're in the middle of the first class when a woman behind you in the class says, in a hushed voice, "That's the prettiest motherfucker I've ever seen."I can't stop looking at you. You might as well just stop staring at everything.The next class is a lot shorter than the first, and even though there's hardly ever a lull, you're still stuck staring at the other students in your vicinity. The woman behind you has a look that makes your eyelids sting a little bit. It seems like maybe you should say something but, as you glance at the instructor, your head starts hurtling toward the ceiling."Oh!" a bellowing instructor exclaims before getting to the point. "Okay, guys, you guys are going to come back into a mirror and tell me, just by looking at your bodies, how many times you've gotten a boner!""Fuck." You mutter.This seems like it would be a good time to take off your sweatshirt. You start to pull it off as your instructor looks at you skeptically."You're going to take this off and we're going to see how many times you've masturbated during this class."You swallow your saliva and get to your feet. "I'll just look at myself for a bit."You're feeling pretty confident now. "I'm just looking at myself.""Okay! I'm just going to be like, 'Hmm, let me look here,' and you're just gonna look right there!"For whatever reason, you still find it a little hard to believe that people actually look to each other without getting turned on, but you're okay with this new reality for now, considering the class is only one minute long. You turn to look at the other students in your vicinity, who are looking at you with all the sexual curiosity you can muster. You can't help but feel a bit self-conscious.There's a big girl with pale-blue eyes walking by and you look down at your own. She's wearing black lace panties. Even though she looks like a fucking angel, you can't help but find yourself staring. When you start to look around and you find yourself staring at a bunch of boys that seem to be staring at her as well. You take the opportunity to get her attention."I'm sorry. Can I speak with you for a bit?"She turns around. You've never seen your reflection in water on an iPhone before, so it's like this whole mirror thing doesn't even feel real. Her eyes are green. She's beautiful.But you don't have any control whatsoever over how much you look at her. The way she turns her head, and the way her lips part slightly even as she smiles at a boy that just reached out and grabbed her by the hips, and the way that her shoulders sag slightly when she smiles, all of you do feel like you're being watched.Your instructor, who is walking past you, doesn't stop her. She stands in front of the girl and stares at her with a smile on her face. You can't help but think, if this is how she wants people to take her, what's she planning on doing to those people in the audience?You've never seen any girl before, so when you see her face, you're not going to be able to take this."I'm sorry," you try again after the girl turns her head toward you. "You have very pretty eyes.""Yeah." She smiles. "So, yeah, I'm sorry," she says to the boy who grabbed her ass, "but I don't have time for this.""I'm sorry, too," the boy says. "Maybe if we could just do something with you, then we could talk to each other?""I am very busy at the moment, thank you very much," she says as she looks between you and the teacher. "I'm not the time to…" She stops when she sees your expression."Wait, you're… no, don't stop," you say hastily.
You may have had a different experience of living in your home when you purchased it. This is due to the laws and regulations applicable to the land in which your home is located. Because of this fact there are a number of local, state, and federal restrictions in place that are designed to maximize the value of your home.This is due to a combination of real estate law laws and a property appraiser's opinion of value.The lawsFirst, let's look at the legal status of your home when you acquired it. Since you purchased your home after a foreclosure, it is subject to the same laws as any other mortgagor that did not have a judgment of title or foreclosure notice in their name.The most important of these laws is the National Mortgage Settlement (NMS), which was finalized on December 15, 2003. This settlement, enacted by Congress in the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008, is currently an active federal law and is codified at Sec. 36.303 of the National Housing Act. In effect, the NMS is a federal law that limits certain liens and restrictions to homeowners that received a mortgage from Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac under the National Housing Act of 1968.This article will focus on Sec. 36.303-1 of the NMS and how it relates to home sales.The first federal regulation is Sec. 36.303-3 of the NMS. This regulation requires that the home purchaser be given an appraisal of the property before it is allowed by the federal government to be sold. According to Sec.36.303-3(c) these appraisals are "fair and accurate" (FAOs). There are additional requirements that must be met by the appraiser to be certified to qualify, including a minimum score of 100 for each category of the Fair Market Rents of the local market. There are also additional requirements that may be waived if no alternative methods of appraising the property exist. For more information, see NMS-2.In the case of your home, an appraiser must be certified by a professional mortgage appraiser association or another individual with equivalent training. In addition, the buyer's agent must provide a letter from a legal professional stating that it does not represent, or has not represented, the purchaser in connection with the purchase of the property. If the appraisal is prepared by a non-Federal Government licensed appraiser, that appraisal must also be evaluated by a State licensed appraiser. Finally, the appraiser must indicate in his or her report whether the appraisal was done directly by him or the seller within the past four (4) years.The National Housing Act also requires that the National Housing Trust Fund (NHTF) establish an appraisal program and the Federal Mortgage Lender Board make loan guarantees for home appraisal appraisal programs that are established under the NMS. In addition, the Mortgagee's Association of America (MAA) shall prepare a statement describing and analyzing the appraisal and any modifications and adjustments required by mortgagee associations under the NMS, to which members must agree.In general, Sec.36.303-3 requires the appraiser to provide a written report to the State or jurisdiction in which the home is located, and to the federal government, within 10 calendar days of the sale. The report must contain the following: (1) a summary of the appraisal; and (2) any information needed to complete the appraisal, including information from the seller. The reports are then filed with the local appraiser licensing department. For a complete description, see the regulations under "Federal Regulation of Mortgagee-Assisted Mortgage Transactions" in the NMS.The appraisal must be submitted on real estate tax forms (Form 1040NR) and not by the seller. According to Sec. 36.301-9 of the NMS, an appraisal for a property located in the county of the buyer must be completed and made part of the real property sales tax roll of that buyer, whether or not the property is sold.Next, we will assume that, according to the federal government, the home is a "mortgage loan" as defined under the NMS. The buyer has secured the $180,000 promissory note, and the seller is the "mortgagee." The mortgagee is required by federal law to submit a copy of the appraisal report to the Federal Reserve, and the buyer is required to pay taxes, Title insurance, and appraisal fees to the Seller. For more information, see Sec. 36.302 of the NMS.The Federal Reserve then examines the appraisal report and determines how much it is worth. If the report is valued at $175,000, the buyer must pay taxes, title insurance, and appraisal services to the Federal Reserve. The Feds use the appraised value to compute the federal tax, and then divide that by the number of years the note was outstanding. The result is the amount of tax that the buyer must pay to
In January, the Chicago Board of Trade unanimously voted to approve a resolution to divest from American Airlines after the airline announced it would cut up to 2,000 positions in the coming four years. Now, Chicago's two largest pension funds, the Chicago Teachers Pension Fund (CTPF) and the Municipal Employees' Annuity and Benefit Fund of Chicago (MEABF), which owns the city's fire department, have followed suit. The pension funds' decision is a significant one for Chicago.With a city population of more than 2 million, the city's pension funds own more than $1 billion in AAL stock, which makes a big statement both globally and for Chicago. "This move would send the right signal as we move toward more transparency in the stock market by selling shares in companies that have a negative impact on the communities we live in," said CTPF Chair and CEO John D. Burris.
This story has been updated with additional information about the crash.A plane is seen in a watery grave at an air crash site near San Andreas, Wednesday, Oct. 4, 2015, in San Bernardino County, Calif.An air ambulance landed in Southern California on Thursday after it crashed at the site of a plane crash involving a police helicopter in the San Bernardino Mountains. Officials said the aircraft had been part of a police search for a driver who was wanted on a probation violation in Newport Beach, Calif.The San Bernardino County Fire Department confirmed that one of their engines had collided with an aircraft at San Bernardino Airport around 2:30 at night, and the pilot of that plane had died.Los Angeles International Airport police said another crew member died due to a "sudden cardiac event."A witness told the Los Angeles Times that a helicopter was seen flying low along the runway shortly before the plane went down. "That's when it seemed like somebody was flying the helicopter into the side of the building," he said.The witness was not sure why the aircraft was being flown low.The pilot of that plane died shortly after arrival at the hospital, and the two other crew members on board were hospitalized with nonlife-threatening injuries. No one on the ground had serious injuries and authorities said the wreckage of the plane had dissipated, said San Bernardino County Fire Battalion Chief Brian Kingsley.The injured pilot was pronounced dead after being taken to a nearby hospital, an official said."We lost a pilot," Kingsley said. "There's a helicopter coming to get the body, and we're working on that right now. It's sad."Los Angeles County Fire Department spokeswoman Julie Watters confirmed that one of the firefighters on the scene was killed in the crash. Los Angeles police Department Chief Charlie Beck said the first officer on the scene also died and a female was taken to a hospital in serious condition.
In a series of interviews with the National Enquirer published Wednesday, Donald Trump claims he would happily have a relationship with Bill Clinton—if only the former president would stop "inappropriate" touching women without their consent."I was sitting alone in my apartment one night with a complete stranger who I'd met at a club one night and I said, 'Do you ever touch your women without consent?'" Trump told the tabloid. "And he said—and you know this. 'I don't remember asking for consent but that is not the question.' ""Well, I think he'd respect me more if I didn't talk about it, but I also feel that he's an entertainer and he's going to want to stay on that," he continued, adding that he "wouldn't be upset" if an encounter with Clinton were leaked.AdvertisementIn the interview with the Enquirer, Trump also addressed claims about past sexual misconduct from Bill Clinton."I don't think Bill, like a lot of men, like women who are beautiful—they like them, we like them," Trump reportedly said. "The thing a lot of people don't realize is, I am an entertainer, I'm not somebody's husband."At least one former Trump employee told the Enquirer Donald Trump asked her out on a date at the Mayflower Hotel, where they sat next to other men, and she didn't turn him down; the man she was with was Bill Clinton.Trump has been embroiled in a string of sexual assault accusations since last month, including a New York Times report that found Trump "engaged in a period of at least 17 encounters in People magazine between 1995 and 2007," in which the now 62-year-old former president allegedly forced himself on at least five different women.Advertisement"It's true. What I do in my private life I'll leave up to me and my family," Trump told the magazine. "But I want you to know how truly great I think you are, and very few people can say that."Trump also reportedly said Trump's comments on women are completely different from his public rhetoric about women."I am always attracted to beautiful—I just start kissing them automatically, you can do anything," Trump reportedly said. He added that his behavior makes up for a lot, like his "love of women," which he noted he's said "a million times" over the past 15 years.
As the sun began to sink through the clouds, as the sounds of the car filled the air, and as the world slowly settled towards the end of August, the temperature rose and set in. It was almost two in the afternoon, but in that time, it was so hot, there was no doubt she would have to go back for food. "Where's the bus? I can't believe I haven't eaten!" said Emma. "We should have something to eat. I have to get out. We need to stay warm so we can take all the pictures we'll need.""We should go to bed early, don't you?" asked Anna. "We have all night. You think the bus drivers will let you walk? Maybe you should get your own car!"Their voices were quiet for too long and it was then, as the heat began to set in and the silence began inching closer to being deafening, that Emily pulled her knees up, cradling them in her arms, and kissed her way down her thigh. For a moment, Anna's thoughts wandered back to Emma, and she wondered if she had ever been so close to her, and felt such the same emotions. When she pulled back, she found she had to laugh. Emma was still laughing when Anna came to her eyes."So?" she asked."It's not safe," said Anna, trying not to sound too desperate. "Come on. I'm not going to sleep with you.""It's the whole truth," said Emma. "I mean it. I'll even come with you if you want.""I don't wanna sleep with you," said Anna. "I don't want you to get hurt.""I'm a good person," said Emma. "I won't hurt you. Besides, I got all these pictures I wanna take with you, so I will." There was a pause, and something about Emma's eyes glistened with a bit of moisture. "Are you cold?""Yes," said Anna."You should wear warmer clothes," said Emma."I am going back to sleep," said Anna."Come with me?" said Emma. And then, Anna was led down a few steps, to a small, dusty stairwell. She was a little frightened at the sight of someone else there. "Come with you to my room, Anna," said Emma."Who are you?" asked Anna. She didn't know if the sound of Emma's voice frightened her more or less than her lack of ability to move."You don't know me," said Emma. She was a blonde, and she had a long, thin face. Her hair was a little wild, and she had a very thin scar down her cheek. "I'm your friend. Emma.""No," said Anna. "Don't talk about our friendship. I don't want to be with you. I'm really scared out here.""Come on," said Emma. "Come on, we'll go somewhere a little safer, and we'll see how well things go.""No," said Anna. "I'm not going back.""Okay," said Emma. "I'll meet you there."And that was the last the two of them said as they left the small, empty room and headed down the stairs, through the hallway and down a short hallway. It took many steps more before they began to see anyone else, or anyone much at all. The hall was long and winding, and while there wasn't a single person at each place they passed through, the sound of footsteps, rustling through grass, and the sounds of animals occasionally made themselves heard as if passing by as Anna and Emma moved.There were no trees in the area either, but that is what made the hallway so much less comfortable. It was hard to get any real distance between Anna and Emma, and the closer they got, the colder it became, and Elsa was so thankful she could move very little. She could probably still make it out on time if she left things to her sister's abilities, but this was going to be hard to deal with. Anna couldn't move as well as she used to. Her hands were starting to feel too numb to use."Where are we going?" asked Elsa."There's a park across the street," said Emma. "It's only gonna get a little darker in here, so we should take the time to take out the cameras we've got lying around. A lot of pictures here, really interesting ones. But you know."Elsa nodded in agreement."You'll like it here," said Emma. "It's nice, isn't it?""I guess," said Elsa, not sure exactly what she was expecting from this place, but the lack of heat at
It was at the same time as you were saying that the President was going to take your advice, I would point out that during the campaign, you said, you know, "Look, here's what I think about Obamacare and what we do." You know, you put into words what your political view of it was. He was against it, and you were for it. So I would just point out that the first time you ran for President, you spoke about your position.And then what you said in that first speech when you came out of there was, "I do not think that we ought to repeal Obamacare."So, in other words, what I'm saying is, we're just getting it wrong now, and he's going to fix it. And when you have one side that says, "This just doesn't make any sense. Look at how expensive it is," then you have to give the other side an opportunity to have a rational and rational-sounding point of view.It does make a difference when you understand the politics. You've got four Republican Senators. There are 14 Republican senators who voted for the bill [that created the Obamacare replacement]. There are a few other Senators who have said it's kind of a good idea, but I'm going to vote against it because I don't like the timing, I don't like the structure, I don't like the cuts. I don't like the big stuff. But you have to be able to take the politics out of things and focus on the substance of what that bill really looks like in terms of Medicaid policy.The way we see the country, it's very, very different from the way that it is on Fox and MSNBC when people try to talk about health care policy or anything else. We're not a country where people just say the word "Obamacare." We have to understand that.In your piece, you say, "Obamacare is a disaster." How do you square that with what you were saying at the same time — that you said you are willing to cut taxes, that you think there's a need to cut spending, and that you didn't want to repeal the whole thing?Right. I don't think that's true anymore, because what happened with the AHCA was as soon as they passed the first draft — because they were not going to put out a bill until it was right — they went from being a bill that was a massive cut and just a tax cut to a tax cut and a reduction in Medicaid. And then the other thing is the Medicare cuts. The other thing is the phaseout of the tax cuts.As long as these two things — Medicaid and the Medicare cuts — were not part of the deal, I think it would have been a bad deal. But because — I think it's fair to say — those issues were part of the deal, I think that was a mistake. I was trying to fix it with the AHCA, which is what this bill is.So you are saying, "Look, I was trying to fix it with the AHCA and I'm going to fix it with the Trump bill." And that's not something you heard people say at the time. You heard people say, "It doesn't help us because we're giving it up to the States!"But look, if you could look into my heart, and say, "Listen, you know what, I've always done this," you'd understand that I have said I know that states should have the right to determine for themselves the right level of healthcare, right? And maybe they don't have the resources to cover these people. And the states should be able to do that.And so if that is in there as a right — which would be a good thing. I don't think anyone would argue that. But at the same time, if we give it to the States so that those States have more flexibility, so they have more options, the States can make appropriate decisions.So the States should have that. I know in states with high Medicaid costs, which is, like, Massachusetts, with, you know, a huge high cost — they're not there because they're not giving Medicaid, they're there because of the fact that they have a very high level of incomes, and they have the ability to cover people. I don't know if you had that flexibility with it in your state because you had a much higher percentage of your population who are Medicaid recipients.But when you look at what the states with the biggest problems with Medicaid have done, they have basically not only gotten more money for Medicaid by increasing the amount that they pay, they've also made some great changes so that they can use Medicaid dollars for the people who really need them. So my feeling is that's the way to go.That's a good way to go, and my feeling is that it's what the States really wanted. It's
"A lot of these young people don't see the world outside their circle of friends or their school, and we've had that effect over the whole course of their career, from the first years of their careers to the last," said David J. Williams, chief executive of the Professional Footballers' Association. "I think this has affected the whole of society."Football is a world-renowned sport but also a great social activity. We're going to fight to the end for that. We've had to push it out into social media. And to be up against this wave of populism and nationalism and racism is a real challenge. The next step forward is to take it up to the national level."The latest survey of 100,000 supporters, including 4,000 who have backed United since the start of the season, also shows that fans have grown more hostile to Liverpool and Leicester, which both finished outside the Champions League places, after the recent results of the England v Italy draw and the World Cup final.
Troy Tulowitzki and Russell Martin could possibly be dealt this week. (USATSI)More MLB: Scoreboard | Standings | Probable Pitchers | Sortable Stats | OddsAll eyes in a potential deal for the Blue Jays and Rockies are being on shortstop Troy Tulowitzki and second baseman Russell Martin, two of the team's best players who are also in their primes. It's looking like both of them will be up for grabs for the Blue Jays.Tulowitzki is in the final year of his current contract (2015), while Martin has a club option in 2016. It's believed the Rockies want Tulowitzki as much as the Blue Jays do -- they've been in the market for a top shortstop all winter to replace Tulowitzki's presence in the lineup.The Blue Jays and Rockies have some mutual interest, and would be open to a deal. It's hard to imagine any deal involving both players as it would require them to be traded in the right circumstances, but there's a chance.The Blue Jays might have the strongest interest in Martin by the fact that Tulowitzki was drafted in their farm system. Tulowitzki was picked 10th overall in the 1998 draft, while Martin was picked in the 7th round of the 1999 draft.Tulowitzki's presence is the reason the Blue Jays have been so successful since they drafted him 10th overall in 1998. He was selected to the all-star team in two straight years, and he was also selected the team MVP in 2010 with the Rockies.Tulowitzki turns 34 in May and hasn't turned the corner as a hitter in the first half. He has a .270/.344/.441 line this year, with a homerun and a double in nine games. But his average over his first six full big-league seasons has been .286/.361/.453 with a homerun and double in 485 plate appearances.There's been some speculation Tulowitzki might retire after this season, a move that would free him up to go sign with the Mets.With Martin, he would be the veteran and leader of the future in Colorado. Martin has been an All-Star once each of the past two years, and he's a two-time silver slugger.Martin has a 7.2 WAR, the 10th-highest WAR in MLB this season and 16th-highest in the NL this season. Both the Rockies and Blue Jays are in full rebuild mode, and Martin is the best veteran left in either organization. The Blue Jays, under new general manager Alex Anthopoulos, have not made any big signing moves since landing them the all-star shortstop by signing David Price in the winter of 2012.
"Don't be stupid! What do you think you are doing?""Oh, I'm not stupid. I just don't want you to take it.""Don't worry, it's just a phone call!""Okay, I'm afraid I can't take your phone call. Just... wait right there.""What? No way. I'm not taking his phone call!""Of course not! Why on earth would you even think that?""Because I won't! You don't like me! You don't like me when I walk into the bar! You call me a bad boy. You call me crazy. You are terrible to me. All of it!""That's it!? All of it!?""Shut up!""I'm not going to let you do that to me!""I don't understand what you're saying, but you are right about one thing. The phone call is too late. The bar is already crowded. I don't have time to be talking to you.""Please, God, just let me hang up.""Yes, just let me hang up.""Yeah, that's fine, but can you just don't talk to me ever again? I was so angry when you said those things. I mean, just a few times more. I can't take it anymore!""Oh yeah, just a few more times to make me feel better.""I'm not giving it up. I'm not going to give you any time.""Oh no, you're giving me up.""Shut up, man, you can't do this.""It took a lot of strength to not yell at him then, when he came in and started crying. It took a lot more strength to not yell at him before, when he came in and started talking to someone else. But, now, I have lost every bit of strength.

Come on, man"I'm a lot easier to talk to when you're angry, and I think you're a lot harder when you're mad, sometimes."
KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia is the most corrupt country, followed by Thailand, Panama and Saudi Arabia, new survey by global watchdog Transparency International has found.This is the first time for a decade that corruption has been included in an annual ranking of the world's most corrupt countries, according to the watchdog.In a statement accompanying the release of the findings, Transparency International said the global picture of corruption appeared to have worsened in the last year.It found that in the last 12 months, corruption "has spread, not worsened, across the world".More than half (57.6 percent) of the countries surveyed made at least one of the 13 countries on the corruption sub-index of the 2016 rankings were considered to be in the top 20 in the 2014 index.A total of 76 percent of countries had not significantly improved their rankings in the 12 months up to the survey, the watchdog said.
Kiwi farmers may be using less water than they used a decade ago, though the extent of their losses to floods and droughts is still unclear.Using data from the Ministry of the Environment, Climate Change and Water, which says some information has been "under-reported", researchers calculated how much water New Zealand farmers have used from 2007 to 2012.The report highlights that while some farmers used significantly less water than they did 10 years ago, more than 40 percent of farms lost more than 10 percent of their annual production to climate change, and a quarter lost more than 50 percent of annual production.It states that agriculture in New Zealand is not suffering from drought, just water shortages, which are expected to worsen.READ MORE:* Drought-stricken farmers pay $30K to stay on the land and avoid eviction* Farmers and residents agree to end legal battle to force relocation of Christchurch farmers* How to survive a drought-related power cut* In Canterbury, farmers get $1.2B to plant rainforests and water* Canterbury farmers receive $1.2 billion in drought relief"In the past, we were pretty good at predicting what would happen in the future so we had some pretty good estimates," said Steve Bewick, a senior researcher at the University of Otago's Centre for Global Energy Policy Studies and a co-author of the report."But we need to work out some new rules about whether it is important to monitor farmers on their annual performance or are farmers just expected to cope with any bad weather."The report said a majority of farms lost between 1 to 3 per cent of their production across the board. In the dry season, they lost between 6 and 12 per cent. The authors say the lack of clarity in the data is one of the many problems caused by the Government's failure to monitor individual farmers."It was probably a matter of good luck that we didn't know earlier how much water farmers were using, but it would be nice if that wasn't the case," Bewick said. "It would have been useful for farmers to know in advance how much water they were using to keep their irrigations running and to decide how much money to pay to farmers at harvest for a shortfall in production."A spokesperson for Agriculture Minister Anne Tolley said the government is working to resolve the ongoing challenge facing rural farmers and will not comment on the report at this stage.The Government was also concerned by the loss of farmland, which the report says dropped by almost 200,000 hectares (500,000 acres) in the past decade."These losses should be taken into account in any future management actions we take, as some farmers will need to sell their land to raise funds for environmental remediation, and others may have to close," the spokesperson said.The report comes as Farmers Union of New Zealand said New Zealand has the worst rate of food loss and waste in the developed world.Farmers are responsible for the vast majority of food losses and waste in New Zealand, in what it called "food desert" New Zealand, where a majority of the country's supermarkets don't have the food required to meet New Zealanders' dietary needs.Farmers are responsible for the vast majority of food losses and waste in New Zealand, in what it called 'food desert' New Zealand, where a majority of the country's supermarkets don't have the food required to meet New Zealanders' dietary needs.The United Nations defines food deserts as "a geographic area in which food consumption levels are far lower than the recommended levels".But the Government has described New Zealand's food situation as "dire" - with the annual cost of wasted food totalling more than $200 million a year.The report's authors stress that not all of the loss was caused by climate change, and that some farming methods may not be able to adapt.The report said "new management options" should be developed, including more "sustainable agriculture systems".
"As a child, I spent a lot of time with my grandma," he said, recalling her as a proud grandmother. "She would tell me stories about how she didn't believe in God. She had an entire closet of prayer rugs," he said, adding that she also had no doubt about climate change."We would have church services and then I would go home and my life would be completely different," said Williams, now 43 and a Christian minister.Now, having moved in many circles, Williams was in the midst of something entirely new. He had entered a world of evangelical Christian homeschooling and conservative Christian political activism, and it was completely unknown to him. "To go to these places and discover these ways that other people lived my life, I wasn't used to that," he said.Like many religious Americans, he felt a spiritual calling to engage in the political and cultural fights we face. But there are a growing number of Americans who are leaving Christian organizations for more active or politically outspoken churches.A recent survey finds that, overall, only 13 percent of Americans identify with a Christian faith. But the survey also found that the number of Americans who are unaffiliated with any religion — which includes atheists, agnostics and adherents of all other types of faith and no religion — has been growing at an average 6 percent a year over the past decade."Americans, especially Americans who grew up in the Christian tradition, are having a big, major spiritual crisis," said David Campbell, pastor of the River Church.Campbell is also the president of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, a nonprofit advocacy group that advocates for secular government and separation of church and state.Americans are having a big, major spiritual crisis — it's really, really bad David CampbellIt's a trend, he said, that has been driven by a combination of things. There's a new willingness to openly express secular views and more media coverage of political issues. But also, Campbell said, "Americans are in retreat."Americans are turning away from institutions that are often perceived to be linked to organized religion. But for those who are part of the religious right, the retreat to secular and noninstitutional groups is often more complicated.The religious right has many institutions and ministries it can turn to for guidance: A major political organization in the United States, the Eagle Forum, for example, gives sermons to the faithful in the name of a conservative political agenda. However, several of its ministries — such as one that helped build the Christian homeschool movement — have become more political and aggressive, even to the point of endorsing Tea Party candidates.The Religious Right has also sought to bring a variety of religious views into the political mix: Evangelical Christians, who tend to be more politically active than other denominations, have helped shape and expand conservatism as a movement.But as this group has expanded to other groups, like the evangelical homeschooling movement, it has encountered backlash: It has been accused of pushing conservative Christian political values without actually practicing those values."I think there is pressure coming from all sides of the spectrum, a lot of it from mainline churches. But evangelicals have not been immune," said Mark Noll, the president of the Public Religion Research Institute.A Pew Research Center report released in 2011 examined the religious right's growing influence across the political spectrum, finding that there has been a rapid expansion and consolidation of religious groups across the political spectrum. Since 2002, the evangelical group called the National Association of Evangelicals has grown by a third while the Southern Baptist Convention has grown by 28 percent."There used to be different denominations and denominations of conservative religious groups," Noll said of evangelicals. But "now they've consolidated."Noll, a Presbyterian, explained that once denominations were too large to manage and their members too varied in their views, they went to a single leader. But now, with more people joining together in religious organizations, there isn't enough overlap between different churches' ministries. So there's not a single leader to keep track of them all. So pastors have to go beyond their individual churches to make sure that people who identify with their particular denomination are still going to see the right values.In some ways, the increasing number of unaffiliated Americans helps the mainline and Catholic groups that the religious right often finds hostile. The mainline churches, Noll said, have traditionally been places where people could find a place for their religious convictions, and now there's a much larger, noninstitutional pool from which to draw.At the same time, the evangelical movement has been expanding. So some of the organizations that have been left for dead have come back to life, Noll said, and they're now reaching more people than ever before.Campbell has also seen the rise of more conservative Christian social and political groups to replace religious groups that have been left behind.And while
In an interview with Reuters, Putin spoke of the necessity for a new relationship in Ukraine between the Russians and Ukrainians, saying, "Ukraine can become an ally of Russia."The interview was conducted Thursday, February 20, and is published to coincide with the G20 summit (a 19-nation confab that's dominated by economic and trade issues)."I am sure that this can be done, provided the political will, which will be there," Putin stated. "It's a big country, so they will understand this, and it's difficult to argue about it in these conditions."He added that Russia, not Putin, is in the best position to settle differences between Russia and Ukraine, and claimed that Western countries have no right to interfere in Ukraine's internal affairs.Putin, who previously stated that Moscow should annex Ukrainian territory, also noted that the two countries should begin negotiations about a political settlement "at some point," and promised to help Ukraine in this regard. "There is no such thing as a permanent border."He added, "If this [the Crimean crisis] persists, we have no choice than to consider a different approach to our relations."While the interview was conducted Thursday, Putin did not explicitly confirm reports of Russian troops massing on the Ukrainian border.Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko has called for a European Union response to Russia's invasion of Crimea, and has demanded the removal of Moscow-backed separatists from his country, but he has made no such demands as of this writing regarding the ongoing crisis.The US has also indicated any action in response to Russia's ongoing presence in Crimea should be carefully calibrated.President Barack Obama on Monday spoke out against the Russian invasion of the Crimean peninsula and promised the US would support Ukraine.

Clinton talks about her time of 'reflection' during sick daysHillary Clinton returned to the campaign trail Thursday afternoon, debuting some new intro music and telling the crowd that her sick days allowed her a chance to "reconnect with what this whole campaign is about."The former secretary of state, who took the stage to James Brown's "I Feel Good," spent the beginning of the week at her home in Chappaqua, New York, after being diagnosed late last week with pneumonia. Her campaign initially did not disclose the illness and only did so after Clinton was forced to leave an event early on Sunday commemorating the 15th anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.Story Continued Below"I tried to power through it but even I had to admit that maybe a few days of rest would do me good," she told the Greensboro, North Carolina, crowd of her pneumonia. "And I'm not great at taking it easy, even under ordinary circumstances, but with just two months to go until Election Day, sitting at home was pretty much the last place I wanted to be.""But it turns out having a few days to myself was actually a gift, I talked with some old friends. I spent time with our very sweet dogs. I did some thinking," she continued. "The campaign trail doesn't really encourage reflection. And it's important to sit with your thoughts every now and then and that did help me reconnect with what this whole campaign is about."Clinton compared her own ability to take a handful of sick days to that of many Americans who she said are forced to "either go to work sick or they lose a paycheck." She said those Americans, and others "living on a razor's edge" with an aging parent who needs help or without the means to afford a college education, are the reason she is running for president.Speaking in North Carolina, Clinton made special mention of the law there forcing transgender individuals to use the bathroom that corresponds with the gender on their birth certificate. The law, seen by many as discriminatory, has prompted the NBA, NCAA and Atlantic Coast Conference to move major sporting events out of the state, costs that the former secretary of state said, "We can't afford.""I'm running for the LGBT teenager here in North Carolina who sees your governor sign a bill legalizing discrimination and suddenly feels like a second-class citizen," she said. "And if anyone wonders what is the cost of discrimination are, just ask the people and businesses of North Carolina, look at what's happening with the NCAA and the ACC. This is where bigotry leads and we can't afford it, not here, not anywhere else in America."Clinton did not address her opponent, Donald Trump, by name but did spend a significant portion of her remarks laying out many of the contrasts she regularly draws with her opponent. She told the crowd that "I am actually asking Americans to hold me accountable for my ideas and hold my opponent accountable for his.""You know, I've been involved in politics. It is not an easy business. It can get rough, and I've built up some defenses. When it comes to public service, I am better at the service part than the public part," she said. "People accuse me of all kinds of things. You probably have seen that. But nobody ever accuses me of quitting. And I will never give up. I'll never walk away. No matter how tough the going gets."

The Buddha's Teaching As It IsIn the fall of 1979, while living at the Washington Buddhist Vihara, Ven. Bhikkhu Bodhi gave a series of lectures on the fundamental teachings of Early Buddhism. Bhante Gunaratana, at the time the President of the Buddhist Vihara Society, suggested he record the lectures so that the Vihara could distribute them as a set of cassette tapes.In the summer of 1981, Ven. Bodhi recorded his ten lectures in the basement of the Washington Buddhist Vihara, using an ordinary, nonprofessional recorder. An enthusiastic lay supporter had the master copies reproduced in large quantities for expanded distribution. They have continued to be distributed on tape and as CDs for over twenty-five years, and are considered "public domain" for anyone to copy and distribute freely. The one condition is that they must not be sold.We recommend that the first time you listen to them, you listen to them in their proper sequence:
As part of a broad initiative to combat sexual harassment and assault, French President Emmanuelle Macron promised to make "gender-based insults" punishable by law.As France24 reports, Macron outlined his plans in a speech marking the International Day for Elimination of Violence Against Women. "The streets should not become hell for the women of France," he said. Macron noted that the Ministry of the Interior has launched consultations that will lead to new measures "in a few weeks' time.""We will … be creating an offense which will give the police the right to issue fines if there is a verbal attack on a woman," he said.The future draft law may also include a number of measures that will make it easier for sexual assault victims to report to police—measures like extending the statute of limitations for the rape of minors from 20 to 30 years, and allowing rape victims to make their initial complaints on online.In an effort to help women get home safely, the law may implement an "on demand" service for public transit, which would let women ask buses to stop anywhere along their route at night."Let's seal a pact of equality between men and women," Macron said, adding that when it comes to sexual harassment and assault, "it is essential that shame changes camp."In France, half of all women, according to France24, say they are victims of sexual assault. Despite recent progress, it's still a difficult topic for women to discuss. Below watch a video in which several women talk about their experiences with sexual harassment and assault, including a shocking experience a woman named Mara had on a city bus.Read the full story at France24.RelatedGender equality minister in France proposes instant fines for street sexual harassers

Intro "In his search for food, early man tried all kinds of plants. Some nourished him, some, he found cured his ills, and some killed him. Few, to his surprise, had strange effects on his mind and body, seeming to carry him onto other worlds. We call these plants hallucinogens, because they distort the senses and usually produce hallucinations--experiences that depart from reality. Although most hallucinations are visual, they may also involve the senses of hearing, touch, smell, or taste--and occasionally several senses simultaneously..."1 Schultes, The compounds that we call "hallucinogenic" are drugs that modify the function of the central nervous system by altering the input from the senses and changing the mood and behavior of the individual. These short term effects have caused some concern among our parents and leaders, but it is the long term influence that we will consider here. "In the history of mankind, hallucinogens have probably been the most important of all the narcotics. Their fantastic effects made them sacred to primitive man and may even have been responsible for suggesting to him the idea of deity."2 Schultes, Dr. Richard Evan Schultes was no drug crazed hippy, but a respected Harvard professor with impeccable credentials. It was apparent to Dr. Schultes that hallucinogens were deeply involved in early religions. He also understood that to broadcast such views could be hazardous to one's career. Hence he confined his revolutionary discovery to one line in a popular guide to plant identification rather than publishing in some academic journal. When etymologist John Allegro went public with his discoveries linking early Christianity to hallucinogenic mushrooms, his career was ruined. It is indeed a subject that can cause deep emotional reaction. That was one of the early tipoffs that something important was going on here. There were such extreme reactions to inquiries about mushrooms that researchers had to come up with terms to describe mushroom haters and lovers. Whole cultures can be categorized by their view as to whether certain mushrooms are considered food or poison. Besides religion, the study involves ritual cannibalism, sex, and behavior modification. All of this is dangerous territory and may cause strong emotional reactions in the reader. If you DO have an emotional reaction to any of this material, you should sit very still, breath deeply and try to relax. Try to identify your feelings. Are you feeling anger? Frustration? Fear? Hatred? If these feelings are strong, you may want to quit reading. But please don't be mad at me. I'm just telling it like I see it. A certain amount of denial is necessary for survival in these troubling times. In order to function we all need a solid emotional state from which to operate. Like it or not, our basic beliefs, our "World View", is a major component of said state. Messing with your core beliefs can be tricky business. It hurts. It can cause damage; but so can ignoring the Truth. The trick is to use denial to keep your peace of mind, being careful not to be crushed by the Truth when it lands on you. Our beliefs are what holds us together. When the leaders we trust turn out to be liars, thieves and murders, it can shake our confidence and certainly be painful. The feeling of betrayal can lead to nearly uncontrollable anger. When our Gods betray us, it may be too much for some people to bear. Some folks might be better off if they just pass on this material and stick to their beliefs. Proceed at your own risk. However, if you are a seeker, and serious about "meaning of life" issues, you can't afford to turn back now. <- About | Next -> SourcesClick on Author to return to quoted text. 1 Schultes, Hallucinogenic Plants, Golden Press, New York, 1976, p 5.2 Schultes, Hallucinogenic Plants, Golden Press, New York, 1976, p 5.

Get Liverpool FC updates directly to your inbox Subscribe Thank you for subscribing We have more newsletters Show me See our privacy notice Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid EmailEl-Hadji Diouf has reignited his war of words with Steven Gerrard, following the Liverpool legend's retirement on Thursday, declaring: "He was nothing".Ex-England international Gerrard, now 36, called time on his illustrious playing career, following his 18-month sojourn with LA Galaxy.Tributes have poured in to the Anfield icon, who led the Reds to their fifth European Cup success in 2005.However, Diouf has not joined those hailing Gerrard, a player he has previously called an 'egotist' and accused of racism.The pair spent two years as teammates at Anfield following Diouf's £10million arrival in June 2002, signed by Gerard Houllier, but Diouf struggled on Merseyside and Gerrard wrote in his 2015 autobiography that the Senegalese "did not care about football and about Liverpool."(Image: SFR Sport)(Image: Getty Images)Diouf, now 35, speaking on French television, has now declared that "the man, I do not respect."He told French TV channel SFR Sport: "People told me at Liverpool, there was some guys you could not touch, but I touched them. That is why it was complicated for me."Former Arsenal midfielder Emmanuel Petit, alongside Diouf on TV show 'La Vestiare' questions: "Are you talking about Steven Gerrard?"Diouf responded: "I do. Stevie G and Jamie Carragher, the two scousers."Asked about Gerrard's autobiography comment, Diouf responded: "He was right, I am not a scouser. I did not come to Liverpool to buy a house and live there in the future."(Image: SFR Sport)(Image: Daily Mirror)Then, he advances his criticism of the ex-Liverpool skipper."When I arrived I showed him he was nothing at all," said Diouf. "He was nothing at all."I asked him to tell me in which big competition, Euros or World Cup, people think about him."As World Cup winner Petit struggled to recall Liverpool's 2005 Champions League success, Diouf exclaimed: "Here is the proof, even you cannot remember."You are talking about Euros and World Cup. Today I owe you respect [Petit], I owe respect to Mr Zidane because you did win the World Cup."(Image: Getty Images)(Image: Getty Images)Petit fires back, hailing Gerrard as "an immense player", but Diouf counters, declaring that his issues with Gerrard are with the man, not Gerrard the player."I repeat. I respect the player, very big player, but the man, I do not respect. And I told him, I let him know that."With all my respect I let him know. For me in Liverpool, he was not just a player like anyone else. He had to work and play his football as I had to work and play my football."Then as you know, there were some brown-nosers, who went to the manager to repeat what I said. That was the real problem. When Gerrard did that, we had an argument, like real men."That is why he does not like me. He knows I say what I think, that when it is not right, no problem, I am up for it."He could not, he was afraid of looking into my eyes. He was afraid of talking to me. Let's not forget when I arrived I did not ask for his shirt. He asked for my Senegal shirt for one of his mates."(Image: CW PicDesk)Diouf also revealed that he owes a debt of gratitude to his former Lens coach Roland Courbis, who convinced Gerard Houllier to take a chance on the Senegalese forward."If I signed to Liverpool, it is thanks to him. I had not played the World Cup or AFCON [African Cup of Nations] yet."Roland said to Gerard, 'there is a kid you could be interested in, sign him, sign El Hadji Diouf."Gerard came to see me in Lens, to talk to me, and then I started to dream."

The California-based electric car manufacturer joins Jaguar, Land Rover and BMW's Mini as brands opting to drive past the 2016 Detroit auto show after having a presence on the main show of Cobo Center in 2015. (Photo: Susana Bates / AFP/Getty Images)Tesla Motors Inc. is the most recent automaker to bow out of next month's 2016 North American International Auto Show in Detroit.The California-based electric car manufacturer joins Jaguar, Land Rover and BMW's Mini as brands opting to drive past the 2016 show after having a presence on the main show of Cobo Center in 2015.A Tesla spokesperson confirmed the move on Friday."After much consideration, we have decided against participating at the North American International Auto Show. We've always had a very good experience at Detroit," a company spokesperson said in a statement."In Michigan, we have great owners, a strong supercharger network that connects the U.S. with Canada, and are continuing to hire talented employees. But as a small player, Tesla relies on auto shows to not only showcase our products, but engage with consumers and ultimately sell more cars in the region. We are working to change laws so that we are licensed to open stores and service vehicles. Until that happens NAIAS is not an optimal venue for driving our mission to put more EVs on the road."The decision is in-line with comments made by Diarmuid O'Connell, Tesla vice president of business development, on Nov. 20 in Detroit. He said he wasn't sure if the company would have a presence at the Detroit show and hinted the costs associated with a show might be too much especially since Tesla can't sell its vehicles in Michigan."The truth is there is a cost associated with being at these shows. And if you're trying to sell cars, that makes sense," he told reporters. "Making the huge investments that go into setting up these booths and the staffing over the course of two weeks, particularly in a state like Michigan where we can't even sell cars, begs some questions."Max Muncey, the show's public relations manager, confirmed that Tesla informed officials that the company was not planning to purchase space on the show floor. A Tesla spokesperson could not immediately be reached for comment."I'm very confident we will quickly fill that space," Muncey said. "We're in talks with other automakers and partners. There's a lot of interest."O'Connell last month said Tesla's newest car — the Model 3 — is expected to go into production by the end of 2017 and consumers will get to see the car in March 2016, which is around the time of the New York International Auto Show.Both Jaguar Land Rover and Mini cited the Detroit auto show not aligning with their respective brand strategies.Helping fill the voids will be newcomer the Robb Report and Aston Martin, which will return to the show for the first time since 2009."They don't attend any other auto shows, so to bring them back to the show was a great partner to have," Muncey said.The Robb Report — recently purchased by prominent Detroit businessman Dan Gilbert, founder of Quicken Loans — is a magazine that features high-priced products.The 2016 Detroit auto show is open to the public from Jan. 16-Jan. 26. Thousands of news media from more than 60 countries and industry officials also attend the show prior to it opening to the masses.Setting up the multimillion dollar stages, lighting and displays takes three months. Crews started preparing the space in mid-October. Event organizers say this year's setup is particularly important, as about 75 percent of the show floor will be all-new or significantly redesigned for the more than 40 expected worldwide debuts.mwayland@detroitnews.com(313) 222-2504Staff Writer Melissa Burden contributedRead or Share this story: http://detne.ws/1QiDEEt
The Owings Mills Mall in Maryland officially closed its doors in 2015, with the final store closing in 2016. The mall, which once hosted 155 stores and eateries, is now being demolished. These images are part of an ongoing project by photojournalist Seph Lawless , called Autopsy of America , which aims to document America's most abandoned and forgotten ruins. Take a look at some of the last images ever taken of the Owings Mills Mall.
I've easily purchased 25 of these over the last 3 years. I use them in the Micro Slow sticks that I build and beef up to fly fast for other RC guys. I've never had one burn out. The weak point is the shaft, which will bend if it takes a hit. Beside that weak area, this motor is tough and powerful with a 7" prop and a 3's lipo with a high C rating.
Sevilla midfielder Hiroshi Kiyotake has re-signed with former club Cerezo Osaka, an official of the J. League first-division side said Wednesday.Cerezo team director Kiyoshi Okuma said Kiyotake will return on a full transfer as the winter transfer market closed Tuesday. Cerezo have been promoted to the J. League top flight for this season.The 27-year-old will come back to Japan for the first time since the summer of 2012, when he left Cerezo for Nuremburg in the Bundesliga.Kiyotake signed with Sevilla at the start of the season from German outfit Hannover, but has been limited to just four La Liga appearances. His last game came on Dec. 21 in the Copa del Rey.Unable to work his way back into the team with Sevilla contending for the league title, just four points behind leader Real Madrid, Kiyotake's days in Spain appeared to be numbered.Shibasaki joins TenerifeKYODOKashima Antlers midfielder Gaku Shibasaki has signed for Tenerife in the Spanish second division on Tuesday after his proposed transfer to La Liga side Las Palmas fell through.The 24-year-old Shibasaki was expected to join Las Palmas by Tuesday's winter transfer deadline after he flew to Spain on Saturday for final negotiations. But Las Palmas had been juggling multiple potential signings and in the end, opted not to sign Shibasaki.Kashima was willing to take him back, but Shibasaki stood firm on playing abroad and now joins another side in the Canary Islands, off the western coast of Africa. Tenerife is currently sixth in the table and in a promotion playoff spot.
There's constantly some sort of plagiarism row going on in fashion. Whether it's Mango copying Gucci's silk dresses, Nasty Gal copying Saint Laurent's platform sandals, designer's copying other designers, artists or, as was most recently the case, the designs of indigenous cultures and tribes. Last week, London-based fashion label KTZ were in hot water over the "Shaman Towelling Sweatshirt" featured in their AW15 collection – a design which Salome Awa says was copied from her great-grandfather Aua, one of the last Shaman of the Canadian Inuit."They must have seen it and copied it," Awa told The Evening Standard, "They even called the clothing Shaman... My great-grandfather was a very powerful and respected man and he has been used and violated. It was disgusting to see a sacred design used as a sweater... We are a proud people and our ancestors and traditions are very important to us. The way they have taken and degraded this design is unacceptable." The design itself featured in 2006 film The Journals of Knud Rasmussen as well as some books on the culture of the Inuit such as "Northern Voices".In response KTZ, who show at London Fashion Week, have issued a formal apology to Awa saying the brand has "always been inspired by and paid homage to indigenous cultures and tribes around the world" and that it's part of their DNA to "celebrate multiculturalism as a form of art and to encourage appreciation for traditions, ethnicities and religions' diversity". As well as emphasising the multiculturalism of their company, they said that the Inuit community was credited in the press release and that they have already removed the item from sale.Awa's response to the apology was bittersweet, telling CBC North, ""I'm kind of happy about it but sad at the same time... They didn't even mention an apology to my great-grandfather and they didn't even offer any monetary gains to our family... This is a stolen piece. There is no way that this fashion designer could have thought of this exact duplicate by himself." Awa goes on to say that she has some questions from the brand. "Why did you not ask us in the first place?" she asks. "How they obtained the exact replica? Why did they not ask our family? Did they not think we exist? Why are they doing this to other indigenous clothing?"Read KTZ's full letter to Salome Awa below:

That chapter gives a complete review of the chart pattern, compared to what is described below.Cup-with-HandleImportant Bull Market Results for Cup with Handle Overall performance rank (1 is best): not ranked Break even failure rate: 5% Average rise: 52% Throwback rate: 62% Percentage meeting price target: 62% The above numbers are based on 912 perfect trades. See the glossary for definitions.Cup with Handle Identification GuidelinesCharacteristic Discussion Price trend Upward leading to the pattern. I use a 6-month look back (high to high). If price is higher at pattern start than 6 months ago, then I accept it. Otherwise, I visually check to see it's in a short-term uptrend. I no longer require a 30% upward move. Shape A rounded turn that looks like a cup with a handle on the right. U-shaped cup The cup should be U-shaped, not V-shaped. Handle The cup must have a handle on the right. Cup duration From 7 to 65 weeks Handle duration 1 week minimum with no maximum. Handle Forms in upper half of cup. Cup Cup rims should be near the same price level but be flexible.Cup with Handle Trading TipsConsult the associated figure on the right.Trading Tactic Explanation Measure rule Measure the height from the right cup lip ( A ) to the lowest valley ( B ) then multiply by the above 'percentage meeting price target.' Add the result to the breakout price ( A ) to get a target. Inner cup Cups often form within cups (points 1 and 2 ), so trade the inner cup when price rises above the handle (the dashed green line at point 3 ). Trendline If possible, draw a down-sloping trendline along the handle peaks. A close above the trendline signals an early buy. I show this as the blue line extending down from point A on the chart to the right. Buy Buy when price closes above the right cup rim (point A , and the top horizontal red line). Stop The handle low (point C ) is a good place to put a stop. Raise the stop as price rises. Throwbacks Throwbacks hurt performance. Short handle Stocks with handles shorter than the median 22 days show superior post breakout performance. The Measure RuleCup with Handle ExampleThe figure on the right shows an example of a cup with handle chart pattern. The rise leading to the cup with handle begins at C and reaches the left cup lip at point A . Since this is on the weekly scale, the price chart appears narrower than usual, but price rounds downward forming a cup with the right cup lip at B . The handle lasts a few weeks before price begins moving up. The next week, price rockets upward about seven points.-- Thomas BulkowskiOther Cup with Handle Examples
The Wolf currently has the former Seminole as his RB33, but expect Dalvin Cook to get a gigantic bump in the rankings after taking advantage of Latavius Murray's absence during the first week of training camp. Cook is catching the eye of his teammates and coaches, and currently possesses workhorse potential in Minnesota.A succession of poor decisions off the field, ball security issues on the field and a mediocre combine dropped the uber-talented Dalvin Cook all the way to pick No. 41 to the Minnesota Vikings — who let Vikings legend and seven-time All-Pro Adrian Peterson walk in free agency, while adding goal line hammer Latavius Murray in March.After Christian McCaffrey came off the board, us at the Roto Street Journal were pleading for a team like the Bucs, Raiders or Packers to select Cook. Once the Vikings drafted Cook, the fantasy community broke out in a cold sweat. Minnesota does very little to help out their running backs: from their porous offensive line, to their up-and-down passing situation and blah-scheme, it's tough to be a running back for the purple and gold.The Wolf was especially hurt by this combination, stating:Cook landed in arguably the worst spot possible with Minnesota. Indeed, the talent is there, but that's about all he has working in his favor. The team dished out oodles of money for Latavius Murray, who will undoubtedly be involved, especially near the stripe. Additionally, the line is among the worst in football, and there's little else really threatening defenses or creating TD opportunities. Throw in a bland, vanilla scheme, and Cook will be relying on his own high-end abilities to produce any fantasy value in 2017.Although Murray had the highest percentage of carries inside the 5-yard line last season (81.8 percent in Oakland), we didn't take the severity of his ankle injury into account before grading out Cook's situation. The reason why Murray took multiple free agent visits was to prove to teams in person that the bone spurs in his ankle were not serious, and the Vikings took the bait. The former Raider underwent surgery on his ankle a week after signing and was expected to be ready for the start of training camp.Fast forward to the start of training camp, and Latavius Murray is still MIA. In fact, on July 31st, Murray put no timetable on his return and would only commit to the regular season. After missing the entire offseason program and the start of camp with his new team, a frustrated Murray stated that he's "behind the 8-ball." He went onto say, "if I'm not healthy, there's no point in me being out there. If I'm not good out there, I can't help the team regardless."Meanwhile, the rookie running back is taking full advantage of his opportunity by taking the majority of the first team reps and he's caught the attention of his teammates and coaches."The first thing the veteran players I've talked to about him say is, 'This guy gets it.'" coach Mike Zimmer explained after a practice. "He understands protections, he works hard, they see how he interacts in the locker room, and that's part of it. And then, when you have a special player—like when we got [linebacker Anthony] Barr—they say, 'Hey, man, this guy is different than other guys.' "That's kinda how he is. They see him out there on the field with the other guys, and it's like, 'There's something different about this guy, the way he runs, accelerates, the creases he can get to.' He's got a tough mentality. Players can see exceptional athletes. When they go out there and they're going against guys, they can see: This guy is pretty good."As one can see, it's safe to say that Dalvin Cook has earned the staff's trust, and with Murray still sidelined, he's truly entering a workhorse role. The cause for concern is still there, as he has a tendency to fumble, and once Murray joins the team, he's likely to vulture 7-10 touchdowns from the 5-foot-10, 210 lb rookie. The offensive line still sucks and the scheme is still as vanilla as can be, but with his elite pass catching skills, he could definitely see 250-plus touches. In fact, Vikings beat writer Matt Vensel of the Star Tribune said, "don't rule out" 300 touches for the rookie.Cook will bring big-play ability (10 50-plus yard runs at Florida State), elite hands for a runner (79 receptions in three seasons) and every-down potential (766 touches in three seasons) to a Vikings team that desperately needs a legitimate playmaker. Don't forget about his blazing speed, which was on display when he dusted cornerback Xavier Rhodes — and his 4.4 40 speed — down the sidelines during
The Obama administration is being slammed from all sides for its failing strategy against ISIS—and rightly so. But amid all the scorn, one question has yet to be asked about the resiliency of the terror army, which actually goes to the heart of its decade-old war doctrine. Namely: Does ISIS actually win even when it loses?This isn't an academic issue. America's allies in the ISIS war are gearing up for a major counteroffensive against the extremist group. That assault that could very well play right into ISIS's hands.Having superimposed its self-styled "caliphate" over a good third of Iraq's territory, in control of two provincial capitals, ISIS is today in the strongest position it has ever been for fomenting the kind of sectarian conflagration its founding father, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, envisioned as far back as 2004.Zarqawi's end-game was simple: by waging merciless atrocities against Iraq's Shia majority population (and any Sunnis seen to be conspiring with it), Zarqawi's jihadists would have only to stand back and watch as radicalized Shia militias, many of whose members also served in various Iraqi government and security roles, conducted their own retaliatory campaigns against the country's Sunni minority. Internecine conflict would have the knock-on effect of driving Sunnis desperately into the jihadist fold, whether or not they sympathized with the ideology of al-Qaeda in Iraq, Zarqawi's franchise and the earliest incarnation of what we now call the Islamic State.Indeed, in the mid-2000s, the Jordanian jihadist nearly got what he wished for by waging spectacular terror attacks against Shia civilians and holy sites, such as the Golden Mosque in Samarra, a strategy which quickened devolved Iraq's violence from a primarily anti-American insurgency into all-out civil war. The only stopgap for a truly apocalyptic or nation-destroying result was the presence of nearly 200,000 U.S. and coalition troops. Today, however, absent such a foreign and independent military presence, the main actors left in Iraq are the same extremists—Shia militias and ISIS.This fact was only driven home last week after thousands of U.S.-trained Iraqi Security Force personnel, including the elite counterterrorist Golden Division, fled from Ramadi, allowing the city fall to a numerically modest contingent of ISIS jihadists. Having been initially instructed by Iraq's Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi to refrain from defending the city (no doubt at the prompting of Washington) the Hashd al-Shaabi, the umbrella organization for these Shia militias, now say they are prepping a massive counteroffensive to retake Ramadi. It promises to be a drawn-out and highly fraught counteroffensive, pitting paramilitaries—which have been accused of war crimes and atrocities by Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights—against genocidal ISIS militants.Many Iraqis fear, with good reason, that this counteroffensive will also extend to Sunni civilians who will now be branded "collaborators" of ISIS, as they have in previous Hashd-led operations. The result: torture, extrajudicial killing, and ethnic cleansing. Nothing would better serve the ISIS narrative or legitimate its claim to be the last custodian and safeguard of Sunni Muslims in the Middle East. Such an outcome might even precede the eventual disintegration of the modern state of Iraq into warring ethno-religious enclaves. That this was ISIS's plan all along adds yet another grim paragraph to the obituary of American-hatched adventurism in the Middle East.True, Hashd al-Shaabi has routed ISIS elsewhere before, namely in Amerli and Jurf al-Sakhar and Tikrit. In the aftermath, the militia was accused of committing human rights abuses, but those accusations didn't tear the country apart.The difference with Ramadi, however, is one of both scale and symbolism. This city of close to 200,000 is dead center in the Sunni heartland of Iraq, where ISIS has the home advantage. Ramadi was also, not coincidentally, the cynosure of the so-called "Anbar Awakening," which saw hundreds of thousands of Sunni tribesmen rise up against ISIS's predecessor, al-Qaeda in Iraq, in a cautious but fruitful partnership with American soldiers in the mid-2000s, a grassroots counterinsurgency whose gains were then solidified by the "surge" orchestrated by U.S. commander General David Petraeus. This time, absent any American combat forces, there are Shia Islamists who have never before tread into Ramadi. Many Iraqis dread the consequences."Iraq is not unified," Iraq's former Deputy Prime Minister Rafe Essawi, a senior Sunni political leader originally from Anbar, told The Daily Beast. "Fifty percent of the country belongs either to Kurds or ISIS, and 50 percent belongs
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office reinforced what private-sector economists have been saying for months: The best proposals to spur the economy would cost the government but prove better at quickly creating jobs than pursuing an anti-regulatory policy as proposed Republicans in Congress.CBO Director Douglas Elmendorf said extending unemployment benefits or payroll tax breaks to those who are most likely to spend the money, as well as providing as tax credits to companies that hire new workers, are among the types of policies that could best boost the economy and create jobs. Rolling back regulations would not have the same immediate jolt, according to a new report."The economic effects of certain changes in regulatory policies probably would be too small or would occur too slowly to significantly alter overall output or employment in the next two years," Elmendorf wrote this week on the CBO blog.The CBO's analysis comes as Congress is deeply divided over the best approach for strengthening the sluggish economy at a time when jobs are the top issue on voters' minds. The congressional super committee is also struggling to reduce deficits. The report offered a gloomy outlook under current policies, with an estimated 9% unemployment rate through 2012 and economic growth lower than potential.
"The attrition rate, even very high up in the draft, is staggering. It might be 50 percent of first-rounders that actually become good major league players. And that probably drops by half once you get into the second round. And it probably drops by half again when you get into the third round. Those top-round picks, there still is an awful lot of fallout."— Paul DePodesta
Major events in the history of SGI and Priesthood1941Division between Soka Kyoiku Gakkai and the priesthood surfaced because of the priesthood's obedience to the authorities' demands during the II World War to regard the Emperor as superior to the Buddha.1952After the war ended, the second president, Mr Toda was banned in 1952 from entering the Head Temple, because of Soka Gakkai's youth demand of an apology from a priest who cooperated with the military authorities.Toda wrote: "I thought I'd receive a reward for my loyalty in rebuking slander of the Law, but instead of praise, they handed me a reproof: 'You're banned from visiting the head temple!' My disciples replied in unison, 'Then we won't visit either, so there!'" People are Sovereign1979The priesthood banned P. Ikeda from giving guidance, demanded his resignation from presidency, and demanded absolute obedience of the organisation to the priesthood. P.Ikeda turned that setback into a victory through focusing on world wide movement and strengthening SGI.Despite the pressure and harassment, lay believers never stopped assisting the Head Temple, donating land, buildings and branch temples: " …the Soka Gakkai built a total of 356 temples, of which 320 were built while I was president. Also, over the years, we conducted countless group pilgrimages to the head temple – the aggregate attendance coming to more than 70 million".People are Sovereign1980-sMany members were questioning the conduct and the expensive life style of some priests (using members donations), Ordinary members raised their complaints about local priests excessive demands for conducting spiritual services, such as at marriages or prayers for the deceased (and which required considerable donations).Together with the monopoly on issuing Gohonzon, the priesthood objected to considering lay believers as one of the Three Treasures (being: the Buddha, the Law and Samgha or the Community of Practitioners), asserting that the Treasure of Community is that of the Priests-only. Another matter of disagreement was the concept of Heritage of the Law, with the priesthood asserting that the heritage belongs only to one person (the High Priest), excluding laity.1990"Then, in December, as 1990 was rapidly drawing to a close, the priesthood suddenly sent the Soka Gakkai with a letter of inquiry. It contained a list of the most ridiculous charges – such as the accusation that singing Beethoven's great hymn to universal human freedom, 'Ode to Joy', constitutes 'praise for non-Buddhist teachings'.Furthermore, the priesthood demanded a response to their charges within seven days". People are SovereignSGI request for dialogue with the priesthood was rejected by the Head Temple - assuming that lay believers will leave SGI organisation and register in temples. Members, however, submitted a petition asking for the resignation of the High Priest. Finally, the SGI was excommunicated from the Head Temple (28 November 1991), a date recognised by SGI as the day of spiritual independence of ordinary people."We must ensure that the common people are eternally free from domination by evil tyrants. The people are the base upon which all things rest, the most important factor. A power that does not rely on authorities, that is unswayed by them, is to be found in the power of humanity, of unity and of democracy. We must never allow this power to be diminished. This is the profound significance of the Buddhism of human revolution, which stimulates and nurtures this human power to the highest degree."SGI Newsletter 5821, 5826 (Dec. 2003)1992Several temples refused to follow the High Priest and disassociated themselves from the Head Temple (Association of Reformist Priests), giving their support to SGI. One of the basic issues between the Priesthood and the Association of Reformist Priests is the demand for the Head Temple's apology for supporting the war and for altering Nichiren's letters.2000The Priesthood completes destruction of its Head Temple, the Shohondo building, which was donated by the Soka Gakkai._________________________________________________Back to: Nichiren Shoshu & S G IHomepage
When the head of the CIA's torture unit decided to destroy videotapes of his team's horrific work, he unwittingly set in motion a series of events that led to the release this week of the most massive, detailed documentation of unlawful behavior by high-ranking government officials and intentional infliction of pain on noncombatants by the United States government since the Civil War era. Here is the backstory.One of the reasons repeatedly stated by President George W. Bush for the American invasion of Iraq in 2003 was the maintenance of "torture rooms" by Saddam Hussein. While making this very argument, Bush was secretly authorizing CIA agents to engage in similar unlawful behavior for similar purposes: intelligence and deterrence. Bush sounded credible when he claimed that his administration adhered to federal and international legal standards.He knew he could make that claim because the torturers were sworn to secrecy, as were their congressional regulators. The CIA charter permits Congress to regulate the CIA in secret. Congress has established two secret congressional committees, one from the Senate and one from the House, to serve as monitors and regulators of CIA activities. The stated reason for the secrecy is to keep our enemies from knowing what the CIA is doing. The effect of the secrecy has been a muzzled Congress, lied to by law-breaking and rogue CIA officials.Until now.When the Senate Intelligence Committee staff learned of the destroyed videotapes (a federal crime the Justice Department declined to prosecute) and reported that destruction to Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), the committee chair, she ordered an investigation to determine whether the CIA officials who had briefed her committee had told the truth. If they had been truthful, she reasoned, why destroy the tapes? In order to conduct that investigation, Feinstein ordered the CIA to make available to her committee's investigators whatever documents and digital data the investigators sought.During the course of the investigation, Senate investigators suspected their computers had been hacked. When they brought those suspicions to Feinstein, she ordered another investigation, this one aimed at identifying the hackers. That investigation revealed that the CIA itself was spying on its own Senate investigators. When she approached CIA Director John Brennan about this, he denied it. When she went to the floor of the Senate—where her vow of secrecy may lawfully be disregarded—to reveal that the CIA had spied on her and her fellow Senators and their investigators, the CIA denied it. When she released incontrovertible evidence of CIA domestic spying, Brennan admitted that his agents had spied on their regulators (another federal crime the feds declined to prosecute), but claimed it was needed because the regulators had exceeded their authority in examining CIA documents.All this put the original investigation of why the tapes of the torture had been destroyed and whether the CIA had been truthful to the White House and its congressional regulators into high gear. When the investigators' final report—all 6,000 pages of it, much in lurid detail—was completed, it was sent to the White House, which decided to release it. The CIA begged for redactions of agents' names and other identifiers, and a long process of negotiation ensued between the White House, the State Department, the CIA, and the Senate. This week, Feinstein had had enough and decided to release the report with the then-agreed-upon redactions.The report is damning in the extreme to the Bush administration and to the CIA leadership. It offers proof that the CIA engaged in physical and psychological torture, some of which was authorized—unlawfully, yet authorized—and most of which was not. The report also demonstrates that CIA officials repeatedly lied to the White House and to Senate regulators about what they were doing, and they lied about the effectiveness of their torture.If the allegations in the report are true, we have war criminals, perjurers, computer hackers and thugs on the government payroll. We also have dupes. The most politically successful argument the torture lobby has made is that we are all safer because of these dirty deeds. This Senate report refutes that argument by demonstrating that no serious actionable intelligence came from the torture.All torture is criminal under all circumstances—under treaties to which the U.S. is a party, under the Constitution that governs the government wherever it goes, and under federal law. Torture degrades the victim and the perpetrator. It undermines the moral authority of a country whose government condones it. It destroys the rule of law. It exposes our own folks to the awful retaliatory beheadings we have all seen. It is slow, inefficient, morbid, and ineffective. It is a recruiting tool for those who have come to cause us harm. All human beings possess basic inalienable rights derived from the natural law and protected by the Constitution the CIA has sworn to uphold.

Laser rangefinders are excellent tools that help you to determine longer distances that wouldn't be practical or possible to measure by hand. Since their inception, these gadgets have been improved and modified to become serious pieces of equipment. Their scope of use extends far beyond standard construction or labor contexts however.Laser rangefinders are also a great asset to use when mountaineering or hunting, along with other outdoor activities. www.bestrangefinderreviewsguide.com is a great resource for determining which rangefinder is best suited for your needs.Without having access to a laser rangefinder when mountaineering, it is simply impossible to measure the distance up a mountain unless you hike it! But in order to gather the necessary information you need on a hike, a quality laser rangefinder can help you figure out the distance to your next location. This not only provides climbers with an understanding of distances, but it also helps to increase safety by providing accurate and reliable information from which climbers can use to make important decisions, especially on more dangerous and technical routes.Another great feature of laser rangefinders are their compatibility. When you're out climbing mountains, the last thing you need is more stuff weighing you down. A majority of laser rangefinders are designed to fit inside your bag with no problem. Depending on your preference, rangefinders for mountaineering can also be handheld or come with a tripod for added stability.Hunting is all about precision and accuracy. Make any small mistake and that opportunity you had can disappear in seconds. That is why hunters strive to remove all of the unpredictable or unknown variables that they can, ensuring the best chance of making the shot. That is why rangefinders are becoming more in more popular in the hunting world. Rangefinders can provide hunters with the exact distances between them and their targets.This takes a lot of guesswork and estimating out of the equation which highly increases the chances of a successful shot. There are rangefinders that can be found designed for the sole purpose of hunting. Some models are designed for hand-held usage, while others include mounts or poles. Still, some other models mount directly onto your hunting weapon of choice, whether that be a bow, rifle and more.Some of the major manufacturers of laser rangefinders include Bushnell, Luepold, hunting giant Cabela, and even some camera manufacturers such as Nikon and Canon produce their own quality laser rangefinders. Depending on the laser rangefinder itself and the manufacturer, their specificity of use may differ. For those wanting to use a rangefinder for only hunting, it would be wise to purchase one from a company who specializes in this field. The same goes for those looking for laser rangefinders for the sole purpose of mountaineering. In effect, all laser rangefinders accomplish the same task, but some added features can specialize it to the user's particular needs.Whether you are climbing a mountain or heading out for a weekend of hunting, guessing distances won't help you succeed. Take away all of the doubts and guessing by utilizing a laser rangefinder. The sheer accuracy of these tools will make sure that all of the unknown variables are removed. If you're climbing a mountain, you no longer have to worry if your estimates are correct. For those of you hunting, you can remain confident that one shot is going to count.
The Coalition For Economic Survival (CES) urges a NO vote on Measure S, on the March 7, 2017 Los Angeles City ballotCES believes Measure S threatens to delay or stop projects that would otherwise provide affordable housing, and housing for homeless people.Measure S puts a two-year moratorium on development projects requiring certain zoning or height exemptions, and permanently prohibits developments requiring a general plan amendment. Thus, it could stop projects that would provide permanent supportive housing for people that are homeless – housing that voters approved with the passage of Measure HHH last November.Clearly, there is a great need for government action to protect neighborhoods and much more action is needed to preserve our existing rent controlled and affordable housing stock. In fact, this lack of action at City Hall, no doubt, opened the door for Measure S to make it to the ballot.Measure S does have some good provisions. The City should be updating community plans. Obviously, in response to Measure S, the City Council just voted to back an effort to update community plans more frequently.Additionally, developers should not be allowed to select environmental impact report consultants for their projects.But, it is our belief that Measure S is a sledgehammer approach that does not provide a solution. In fact, it may make matters worse.Measure S is not the answer and should be voted down.Measure SDoes Not Stop Ellis Act evictionsDoes Not Stop condo conversionsDoes Not Stop rent controlled housing being demolished. In fact it may led to the destruction of rent controlled buildings.Does Not Create new affordable housingDoes Not Stop big developers from donating to elected officialsMeasure S DOES Stop Affordable Housing from Being BuiltMeasure S would provide an incentive to developer to destroy more rent controlled buildings.A two year moratorium on development targeted in Measure S could steer developers towards other types of development such as more demolitions and conversions of rent controlled housing to condos resulting in further displacement of low and moderate income renters.The Measure S moratorium, and its permanent prohibition on the City's ability to issue general plan amendments, will be stop the building of affordable housing. Although the backers of Measure S claim to exempt affordable housing, Measure S does not actually exempt all 100% affordable housing projects from its reach, and would effectively stop 90% of city-sponsored affordable housing projects.It is for these reasons CES Urges You to Vote NO on Measure S!Advertisements
If you haven't been paying attention: Republicans have been so gung-ho about stripping health care from millions of people and giving tax cuts to a few monstrously rich people that at the end of September they needlessly let the Children's Health Plan (CHIP) expire - just like too many kids and adults s will if the GOP can't figure out how to act like human beings, and govern accordingly. Currently, CHIP provides health care to almost nine million children nationwide; if Congress, which has historically summoned a reasonable facsimile of bi-partisan support for what most normal people would consider a basic human need, can't find the will to reauthorize it in the next few weeks, at least 16 states will run out of funding by January 1.Many good people, including Jimmy Kimmel and Alabama's newly-elected Doug Jones, have urged lawmakers to confront the grotesque negligence toward children that would be the demise of CHIP. But Rachel Pearson, a cheeky pediatrician in Texas who used to believe everyone deserved health care, says she's come to learn those in need are "ungrateful, yowling, diapered maniacs who don't even use language right" and are often "literally carried from place to place in the arms of a real taxpayer." "Most of my patients have never worked a day in their lives," she writes. "Patients have punched me, bitten me, screamed at me, and even urinated on me...Sometimes, I have to bribe my patients with bright-colored objects, juice or graham crackers. (Do) my patients thank me? Do they contribute to the economy? No!..." If CHIP isn't funded, she adds, perhaps letting more American kids die preventable deaths "will send a strong message to kids across the country: Pull your thumbs out of your mouths, get potty-trained and GET A JOB!" Hopefully, eventually, one that would remove the GOP from power.
BW semi-spirit themed tempo/aggro deck. The cards we run aren't individually powerful, most die like flies, but have a lot of potential for a tempo'y deck where you counter, blink or hexproof all of your opponent's attempts of dealing with your prodding.Each creature does something extra for the greater good, allowing everyone to keep pressure up.Rattlechains: Keep in mind that playing this on the end step gives your opponent the chance to remove it when its Hexproof is still on the stack.Bygone Bishop, Anafenza, Kin-Tree Spirit: Although these are great engines, generally might be a good idea to hold these back until you're up 1-2 mana to protect them with a counterspell / Essence Flux. Generally, losing your guys to removal kills your tempo pretty hard.Thunderclap Wyvern: Surprisingly, since you often have 1-2 flyers out at any point, this can swing the game in your favor in a major way. Depending on your opponent, consider playing this with a counterspell up.Stratus Dancer: Still in testing, this might end up in the sideboard. Not having your guys die as they keep smashing in is what the deck is all about. Doesn't synergize well with Essence Flux though, which is a shame.Negate: I find it mandatory, at the very least very important to run this as a 4x in main. So far I haven't been able to reliably aggro with this deck, absolutely everything dies to removal, Planeswalkers wreck us and ramp/draw effects quickly leave us behind. 4x Negate is well enough to make it unsafe for your opponent to freely cast their things and allows you to further mess up their tempo by taking out key spells.Surprisingly, creatures haven't been a problem to this deck at all. 4-5x Silkwrap/Stasis Snare and Reflector Mage are easily enough to keep the board clear enough for you. You don't need to remove everything and a lot of the time the creatures our opponents have aren't a big deal. Gives even further reasons for running Negate.Essence Flux: Even though Flux doens't seem amazing, it does something against absolutely every deck and it comboes with every card at least decently. Targetting Topplegeist makes it a buff and a combat trick while dodging a removal. To Rattlechains it's a buff and saves up to two targets from removal. With Reflector Mage you get another bounce while dodging. Anafenza, Kin-Tree Spirit gives you more counters on top of more counters. While you may not always want Flux, it's such a flexible card that really holds the deck together.Ojutai's Command: I consider this a resiliency play - The average use I see is bringing Rattlechains back and drawing a card, although countering a big creature and drawing/bringing Rattlechains back is a decent one too. I haven't tested this too much, but it seems to do a lot to fix the biggest problem with this deck - losing Rattlechains before it can be replaced.Any feedback and criticism especially is welcome, wanted and encouraged! I've previously played both control and aggro, but tempo is a new thing for me. I feel this concept might give me something to practice as this playstyle seems fairly powerful once it's mastered.

Several people have asked about the techniques we used when cleaning out my mom's fabric stash last week. There are of course many ways to purge, sort, and organize fabric, which I'll write about later. But first, I wanted to address questions about the folding station and the folding method we used.It's the same method I've been using as I've been sorting and organizing fabric in my own apartment. Here you see an in-progress picture of my new studio corner with stacks of uniformly-folded fabric. This is a method I first read about from Monica, the Happy Zombie and later from Marilyn Bohn's video.Of course there are other ways, but this is the cheap, easy, quick one that works for me. The goal is to end up with a stack of fabric that is uniformly folded — the same length and width.The height of each folded piece varies according to how much yardage you have to begin with.To accomplish this, you'll need a stack of fabric (45″ wide works best, though other widths can be accommodated), a flat surface, and a large quilter's ruler. My mom had three 6.5″-wide rulers, so we defaulted to using those for her project. However, the cubbies on my shelf are 13″ wide. In order to comfortably fit 2 stacks of fabric side-to-side, I needed to use a slightly smaller ruler. Mine is 6″ wide and 24″ long.I don't currently have any fabric that hasn't been folded by this method, so I had to un-fold a piece to show you how it's done. Pardon the creases!First, ensure that the fabric is folded in half lengthwise (selvedge-to-selvedge) with the wrong sides together. Many fabrics (including most quilter's cotton) are approximately 45″ wide, which leaves you with a span of fabric around 22″ after it's folded in half. For my ruler of 24″, this is just perfect. It leaves a little bit of ruler poking out on either end.Begin "wrapping" the fabric around the ruler, starting with the raw edge nearest to you. It's almost like you're making a small "bolt" of fabric with the quilter's ruler where the cardboard core would be.Continue wrapping (flipping the ruler away from you) until you reach the other raw edge of the fabric. At this point, you have two options.If the remaining edge is wide enough, you can just fold it over. However, if that edge piece is too small and won't lie flat, there is another option.If the last wrapped edge is too small to lie flat, unfold the bolt of fabric and tuck the edge under. Then, flip the bolt on top of the fold and it will seal the edge up into the wraps of fabric.Pull the ruler out from the center of the fabric. Make sure that it lies flat and the raw edge doesn't pop out.Fold the fabric in half cross-wise. (Hamburger fold, not hotdog.)Place your folded fabric on the shelf with the folded edge facing you. that way, you can see at a glance what colors of fabric you've got.You can see that the finished piece is a little larger than 6″ wide, and about 11″ long. This will vary depending on your ruler, so make sure you understand your shelves or storage spaces before you have to unfold your whole collection!A lot of people store their fat quarters separate from the rest of their fabric collection. My mom wanted hers kept separate, so we did what Monica Zombie suggested and folded the fat quarters in the same way but with a smaller ruler. I prefer to keep my fabric all together, since I'm generally hunting for fabric of a certain color, rather than of a certain size.A fat quarter is generally around 18″ x 22″. Using my 6″ ruler allows me to make a tidy little bolt and store all of my fabric in one place.Fold one edge in…Then the other.Just as before, remove the ruler and fold in half.Voila! If you're starting with 60″ fabric, vintage sheets, or other odd-sized pieces, the procedure is the same. All you have to do is fold it lengthwise (hotdog, not hamburger) to approximately 20-24″ wide before you begin wrapping. For a 60″ piece, I generally just fold it in thirds lengthwise and it pretty much evens out in the end.Be aware that extra yardage (3+ yards) will yield pieces that are noticeably wider due to the sheer bulk of fabric as you wrap around and around. You may need to take this into account as you plan out the size of your storage system
The pace of the race to the top of Fortune's Unicorn List continues to hasten as startups raise ever-larger sums of money to fuel growth and expansion.Airbnb, the well-known home rental service headquartered in San Francisco, has closed a new $1.5 billion funding round, according to reports from the Wall Street Journal and Financial Times. The round, which has been rumored for weeks, values the company at $25.5 billion—billions more than publicly traded neighbor Twitter (TWTR), which had raised far less ahead of its highly anticipated 2013 IPO, and hotel giant Marriott (MAR), which runs more than 4,000 properties around the globe.At the time of its previous investment earlier this year, investors valued Airbnb at $20 billion. Among venture-backed startups, only Chinese phonemaker Xiaomi and car-hailing service Uber carry higher valuations.Investors backing the young company this time reportedly include General Atlantic, Hillhouse Capital Group, Tiger Global Management, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, GGV Capital, China Broadband Capital, and Horizon Ventures."Airbnb is like a giant ship," CEO Brian Chesky told Fortune's Leigh Gallagher in her recent feature story on the 33-year-old chief executive. "As CEO I'm the captain of the ship." With the additional funds, Chesky just got a little more wind in his sails.Want more?

Jason Brezler received support and endorsements from congressmen, a former assistant secretary of defense, and even Marine Corps generals at his board of inquiry, a panel of three officers recommended Thursday that he be separated from the Marine Corps with an honorable discharge.After three days of testimony and arguments and more than two hours of deliberation, the board, composed of Col. James Iulo, Col. Bart Pester and Lt. Col. Todd Manyx, found that Brezler, a Reserve officer and New York City firefighter, had demonstrated substandard conduct, misconduct or professional or moral dereliction, and conduct unbecoming an officer by failing to observe correct protocols for handling classified information. He doesn't deserve to stay in the Corps, they concluded.Brezler came under investigation in 2012 when he received an urgent email from then-Capt. Andrew Terrell regarding Sarwar Jan, a corrupt Afghan police chief with known Taliban ties and a penchant for child sex abuse who had gained access to a Marine base. Brezler, attending a graduate school seminar in Oklahoma at the time, fired off a classified briefing document about Jan from his Yahoo account.When another officer who received the email raised the alarm about sending the document over a nonsecure network, Brezler reported himself to his superiors and cooperated with a Naval Criminal Investigative Service probe into the classified material spillage. The probe turned up another folder with some 106 documents marked secret. Brezler said he inadvertently brought them back with him following his 2010 deployment to Now Zad, Afghanistan, where limited resources sometimes meant Marines worked on their personal computers and thumb drives.Seventeen days after Brezler sent the document about Sarwar Jan, one of the teenage boys whom Jan kept on base grabbed a rifle and killed three Marines, seriously wounding another.Testifying in his own defense Thursday morning, Bezler said his response "was just visceral" when he received the email regarding Jan. "His name brought me great concern, knowing he was somewhere in the battlespace. I immediately responded."When he learned about the deaths of the three Marines, he felt that his worst fears had come true, Brezler said.But a Marine prosecutor said this week that the case was about more than that one communication with Marines in Afghanistan. Brezler knowingly kept classified documents to inform a book he was writing about his Now Zad experiences, said Maj. Chip Hodge, showing that Brezler had copied and pasted a paragraph from the Sarwar Jan document into his manuscript, "Rebirth of Apocalypse Now Zad."Brezler was feigning ignorance by saying he had taken the documents home by mistake and that he used the Sarwar Jan information in his manuscript without realizing it was classified, Hodge said."He knew [the classified information] was there. He knew he had access to it. He knew where to go for it," said Hodge. "... [Brezler] didn't think the rules applied to him."Brezler's defenders are many. His attorneys, Maj. Amelia Kays and Kevin Carroll, submitted 60 letters of recommendation to the board, which included praise from Marine generals. On Wednesday, nine witnesses testified in his defense, including three of his commanding officers and bestselling author Bing West, a former assistant secretary of defense.First Marine Division commander Maj. Gen. Lawrence Nicholson, commander of the 1st Marine Division, wrote that Brezler's contributions in Iraq and Afghanistan "rank among the most important I've seen in the most challenging settings."John Kael Weston, a former State Department official who has advised Marine generals in Iraq and who met Brezler in Now Zad, said his separation would be a loss for the country."We need a bench of experienced officers so our nation is prepared the next time we need a Marine Corps," he said. With Brezler's separation, he said, "The Marine Corps loses, he obviously loses, but we as a nation lose."The case has also received a flurry of press attention from media outlets nationally and in Brezler's home state of New York, with many asking why Brezler was investigated so aggressively after trying to inform fellow Marines about a perceived threat.In his closing argument, Hodge pulled up a Google page showing all the news search results under Brezler's name, suggesting the media coverage following the case should play into the board's deliberation."There are likely millions of people around the country waiting for your decision," he said. "Do we want good military character to trump military actions?"Brezler also has been defended by Sen.
Women across Denmark have complained of harassment by migrants who they accused of making them feel unsafe when out at night.In the town of Thisted in the north of the country, authorities admitted there was a harassment "problem" stemming from migrants based at the local asylum centre which opened in November.Lars Sloth of the town's children and families unit said: "Several young women have felt unsafe on the streets, where they have been accosted by asylum seekers. The same thing has happened on the dance floor out in the nightlife."The Local reports that several migrants based at the camp have also been arrested for being intoxicated, he added, and police will now conduct a campaign to educate them about what constitutes acceptable behaviour in Denmark."First and foremost we want it to be safe and comfortable for all of our residents to move around in Thisted – including in the city's nightlife. Therefore we are initiating extra measures that will contribute to better understanding, fewer conflicts and thus better security," Mr Sloth said.The problem also extends to several nightclubs in the Jutland towns of Sønderborg and Haderslev, which have reported migrants harassing female guests.Glenn Hollender of Sønderborg club Den Flyvende Hollænder said: "We must say that a large number of the male guests who come from the local asylum centre have a very hard time respecting the opposite sex. In my eyes, it is harassment when one or more men continue to touch a young woman after she has said 'stop'."One Syrian migrant who has lived in Denmark for several years told TV Syd that new arrivals in Haderslev "don't know the rules" about how to treat women in Denmark."If they see a girl, they go nuts. They simply can't handle it. The try to grab ahold of the girl's clothes or paw her," he said."In Syria and many other countries, it is not normal for a strange woman to smile at you. Those girls who are harassed aren't necessarily scantily-dressed or drunk. Sometimes it is enough just to be a girl," he added.
Hebrews 1 New International Version (NIV)God's Final Word: His Son1 In the past God spoke to our ancestors through the prophets at many times and in various ways, 2 but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, and through whom also he made the universe. 3 The Son is the radiance of God's glory and the exact representation of his being, sustaining all things by his powerful word. After he had provided purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty in heaven. 4 So he became as much superior to the angels as the name he has inherited is superior to theirs.The Son Superior to Angels5 For to which of the angels did God ever say,"You are my Son;today I have become your Father" ?Or again,"I will be his Father,and he will be my Son" ?6 And again, when God brings his firstborn into the world, he says,"Let all God's angels worship him."7 In speaking of the angels he says,"He makes his angels spirits,and his servants flames of fire."8 But about the Son he says,"Your throne, O God, will last for ever and ever;a scepter of justice will be the scepter of your kingdom.9 You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness;therefore God, your God, has set you above your companionsby anointing you with the oil of joy."10 He also says,"In the beginning, Lord, you laid the foundations of the earth,and the heavens are the work of your hands.11 They will perish, but you remain;they will all wear out like a garment.12 You will roll them up like a robe;like a garment they will be changed.But you remain the same,and your years will never end."13 To which of the angels did God ever say,"Sit at my right handuntil I make your enemiesa footstool for your feet" ?14 Are not all angels ministering spirits sent to serve those who will inherit salvation?

.Explosion That Injured at Least 29 an 'Intentional Act,' New York City Mayor Says (ABC News).An explosion that rocked Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood and injured at least 29 people appears to have been "an intentional act" -- but not related to terrorism, according to New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio.The cause of the explosion has not been determined, said New York City police commissioner James O'Neill. The explosion, which seriously injured at least one person, happened on West 23rd Street late Saturday in an area frequented by shoppers and diners."New York City experienced a very bad incident," de Blasio said at a news conference. "We have no credible and specific threat at this moment."A possible secondary device was located a few blocks away on 27th Street, between 6th Avenue and 7th Avenue, the NYPD Special Operations Division said at 11 p.m. The device, a pressure cooker, was removed by authorities. It was in a white plastic bag with tape, wiring and a cell phone or other electronic device.Police said the device was to be detonated at the NYPD's firing range in the Bronx. Police had earlier advised residents on the block where the device was found to stay away from windows facing 27th Street.There were other suspicious packages and incidents in the area since the pressure cooker was discovered, but they were deemed not dangerous, police said.Bomb-sniffing dogs deployed in NYC's Chelsea neighborhood after reported explosion. Follow @ABC for latest. pic.twitter.com/fH6uF0hGqDThe explosion on 23rd Street between Sixth and Seventh Avenues was seen by police officers driving by about 8:30 p.m., according to police. The fire department heard the explosion and responded immediately.Officials said the NYPD has video it is reviewing and De Blasio urged any witnesses or people who may have information to come forward.Two law enforcement sources said the explosion occurred in a dumpster, and the NYPD Counterterrorism Bureau tweeted a photo of a mangled dumpster after saying they were responding to the explosion.The NYPD Bomb Squad was searching the area and checking garbage cans for any other possible explosive devices.The FBI and Homeland Security officials, along with the ATF arson and explosive task force were also at the scene.Surveillance video recovered from West 23rd Street shows the explosion and contains other evidence that indicates to investigators the original object was intentionally left next to the construction trash container, described as 4 ft. by 4 ft. by 3 ft. in size.In one video obtained by police, a man is seen crossing the street in the vicinity of where the original object was left. The trash container was blown clear into the street by the force of the blast.The object left behind could be a large tool box, left next to one of the several commercial trash containers in front of a building that has been under construction. Investigators are trying to determine if there is a connection to this seemingly "random construction site."The explosion even startled residents who were a few blocks away. Chelsea resident Michelle Leifer was walking her dog in Madison Square Park when she heard a loud boom and rumbling. "I heard a loud boom and felt rumbling," she tells ABC News. "I wasn't sure if it was an explosion or if a large truck had gone by. One of the park's maintenance men came in and said he got an alert on his phone that there was an explosion on 23rd and 6th. As I was leaving the park, I saw a smoke cloud hovering in that area. Then police cars and firetrucks started streaming in."Meanwhile, a "possible secondary device" was located a few blocks away on 27th Street, between 6th Avenue and 7th Avenue, the NYPD Special Operations Division said around 11 p.m. The device, a pressure cooker, was removed by authorities. The device was in a white plastic bag with tape, wiring and a cell phone or other electronic device.The explosion occurred one day after O'Neill was sworn as the new police commissioner following Bill Bratton's retirement.The mayor said the Chelsea explosion has no apparent connection to the explosive device that detonated in Seaside Park, New Jersey, Saturday morning. Nobody was injured in the New Jersey incident, which occurred at a time when a 5k run to benefit U.S. Marines and sailors was scheduled, but the race was delayed because so many runners had signed up.Society & CultureUnrest, Conflicts & WarMayor Bill de BlasioNYPD.— Paul Blake (@PaulNBlake) September 18, 2016
The dismissal of Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin from a Relativity-related fraud suit is being appealed by RKA Film Financing, a bank consortium that's seeking $110 million in damages from investments with the studio that failed to pan out.In a pre-argument filing with the Supreme Court of New York last month, but which has only become public now, RKA claims that the state's high court erred in granting Mnuchin's motion to be dismissed from the lawsuit. See it here.In a suit filed shortly after he was confirmed as Secretary of the Treasury, RKA claimed that Mnuchin and 11 others at Relativity, including CEO Ryan Kavanaugh, duped the consortium of lending the studio $81 million to help finance five films. RKA claimed that Mnuchin and the other defendants secretly knew that the cash would be used to prop up the struggling studio's operations before it filed for bankruptcy protection.The state's Supreme Court, however, dismissed Mnuchin from the case in June, finding that RKA had failed to prove that Mnuchin "was responsible for, aware of, or participated in the purported fraud," and that his "personal friendship with Kavanaugh is insufficient to establish awareness of a liability."In its notice of appeal, RKA argued that the high court erred as a matter of law by failing to consider the specific allegations pleaded in the second amended complaint that demonstrated Mnuchin's "awareness of and participation in the fraud, including by virtue of his position as co-chairman of Relativity's board," that he was "intimately involved in Relativity's financial decisions and transactions," and that his "knowledge of and participation in the fraud can be inferred through Mnuchin's position as co-chairman of Relativity's board while the fraud was ongoing." See the notice of appeal here.RKA also argued that the court erred in dismissing Mnuchin from the lawsuit "because if failed to accept the facts as alleged in the second amended complaint as true and determine only whether the facts as alleged fit within any cognizable legal theory." The news appeal was first reported in the Daily Mail.RKA further argued that court erred "because it failed to accord plaintiff the benefit of every possible favorable inference drawn from the facts pled in the second amended complaint," and by concluding that that Mnuchin would have had to have made a misstatement to participate in the fraud.
University deregulation: Government still committed to higher education reformsUpdatedFederal funding for universities has become a key election issue, with Federal Education Minister Simon Birmingham confirming the Government is sticking with its plan to cut university funding.Key points: Senator Birmingham confirms Government intends to implement 2014 university deregulation planGovernment is still committed to finding savings from the university sectorLabor's Kim Carr said Government's deregulation program means it will cut $12 billion from sectorSenator Birmingham said the Government needed to find savings from higher education."The growth in higher education spending over the last 20 years or thereabouts has essentially gone at double the rate of the economy, so that is not of course a sustainable trajectory for higher education to continue on," he told Sky news.Senator Birmingham confirmed the Government intends to implement the university deregulation plan announced in the controversial 2014 budget from next year."We only ever said that we were deferring implementation of those reforms by 12 months," he said."That is what is reflected in the mid-year economic update [and] has been crystal clear ever since I made that announcement."The Education Minister said the Government was still committed to finding savings from the university sector."We know that we have to make sure that that is done in a way that does not stop universities from accessing the funding they need to be able to provide high quality education, high quality research and contribute to Australia's future, which is why this is it is not just a funding cut — it is a reform program," he said.Government hopes they can slide through to the election: CarrLabor's Higher Education spokesman Kim Carr said the Government's deregulation program meant it would cut $12 billion from the sector."The hope is they can slide through to the election without proper scrutiny and then come back after the election and claim a mandate to slash and burn our university system," he told AM.Senator Carr has committed to spending $14 billion, which is "extra money in our universities to restore the budget cuts".He argued Labor's policy would increase the number of students that complete their degrees."We can restore quality assurance to the university system by restoring the cuts that have occurred to the tertiary education regulator," he said.Senator Carr declared Labor had already outlined the savings measures it would implement to fund its promise.Topics: federal-elections, government-and-politics, access-to-education, university-and-further-education, australiaFirst posted
I have always thought the phrase was "pique my interest" as in:Her mysterious background piqued my interest.However, of late, on blogs and social networks, I have seen people using "peek my interest", as in:Disney is starting to peek my interest.And I have even seen:Samsung's latest display peaks my interest in the company.Which is the correct phrase?
Share:BEIJING- Downplaying reports of cancellation of Chinese President Xi Jinping's maiden Pakistan visit, China today said the trip was never officially announced."We have never officially released any information about Xi's visit to Pakistan. Therefore there is no ground for you to say that we have cancelled the trip," Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang told a media briefing. Qin made the remarks while responding to a question on Xi calling off the visit due to security considerations in the wake of ongoing anti-government protests in Pakistan.Though officially not announced, Xi was due to visit Pakistan, Sri Lanka and India in that order in the middle of this month."China and Pakistan are friendly neighbors. We enjoy all weather friendship and cooperation in various fields. The two countries maintain close high level interactions. With regard to issues concerning high level visits between the two countries in the next step we are in close communication," Qin said.China has already appealed twice to Pakistan government and protesting parties to settle their differences through dialogue. Qin again appealed for political reconciliation in Pakistan to maintain domestic stability. "We hope all relevant parties in Pakistan to make joint efforts to uphold domestic stability," he said.
Former New Mexico Governor Discusses His Role In Otto Warmbier NegotiationsNPR's Kelly McEvers talks with former New Mexico governor Bill Richardson on the death of American college student Otto Warmbier, who returned from North Korea in a coma last week.KELLY MCEVERS, HOST:The Hamilton County Coroner's Office in Cincinnati is investigating the death of Otto Warmbier. A public funeral is planned for Thursday. The 22-year-old died yesterday less than a week after being returned to Ohio from North Korea in a coma. Doctors at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center described his condition as a state of unresponsive wakefulness. President Trump talked about Warmbier's death today.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It's a total disgrace what happened to Otto. That should never ever be allowed to happen. And frankly, if he were brought home sooner, I think the result would have been a lot different.MCEVERS: One of the people who had been working to get Warmbier released sooner is former New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson. His foundation, the Richardson Center, helps negotiate the release of political prisoners. Richardson started working on the case just after Warmbier was detained in January 2016, and he says he had a lot of meetings with North Korean officials.BILL RICHARDSON: I've talked to him a total myself and my chief of staff 20 times in New York. My executive director, Mickey Bergman, went to North Korea at the end of the year with the support of the Obama administration. We offered private humanitarian aid. North Koreans never responded. They never said yes or no. They never agreed to have me visit as I have in the past - a total mystery but obviously a real cover-up.MCEVERS: What do you think happened?RICHARDSON: What I think happened is that the North Koreans engaged in some kind of interrogation, and the interrogation went wrong, that it affected his brain, that he then went into a coma. I don't think they're foolish enough to engage and torture a 21-year-old boy who just stole a political banner. Yeah, he's a bargaining chip, but there's no reason why he might have been tortured.But with the North Koreans in the past, you could get prisoners out in exchange for high-level visits, humanitarian assistance. With Kim Jong Un, the leader of North Korea now, we could make a deal with his father on prisoners, and we've been able to but not with this man. We don't know what he wants. We don't know what makes him tick. Obviously it's something very bad.MCEVERS: There still are three other American hostages in North Korea. What do we know about them? What does this mean for the efforts to get them released?RICHARDSON: Well, if the North Koreans are smart, they'll let them go as a gesture of contrition and goodwill after this disaster. They were visited by the American diplomat in North Korea when he went to get Otto. I suspect they're in - I won't say good condition, but at least they're there. I think the State Department would have a better feel for how they're doing. But you know, this is Americans held as bargaining chips. There's also a Canadian there that we should be concerned about.MCEVERS: You know, relationships between the U.S. and North Korea are already basically non-existent. Have you talked to the president about this, and what do you think the U.S.'s options are going forward?RICHARDSON: Well, we have to be sending a very strong message that North Korea needs to have a suitable explanation. Secondly, we need to make sure that there's transparency on their part, maybe a human rights investigation by the U.N. But I wouldn't be opposed to putting more sanctions on North Korea. I don't think the military option makes any sense. I think eventually diplomacy must rule but not for now. I'm very sour and sad and angry right now.MCEVERS: It's a tough question to ask, but you know, at this time, some people are pointing fingers at one administration or another. Do you think that's useful at this time?RICHARDSON: It's not useful 'cause I worked with the Obama administration, and they were aware of this. The North Koreans were waiting for the new administration to come in. The Obama people tried. But the election happened, and the North Koreans wanted to probably deal with the Trump administration. And so they gave the Obamas no answer and didn't release Otto or disclose anything as they should have.MCEVERS: Former New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson - his foundation, the Richardson Center, helps negotiate the release
6 Reasons to NEVER date a Single MotherPost by Older Bachelor on Dec 13, 2004, 7:40pmSingle mothers. Well, here are MY issues with them (This pertains to a woman who had a kid and never married, or divorced her husband because "She wasn't happy". If she had a good marriage and he died, there might be wiggle room, but I still wouldn't date her).1: She decided to have a kid without a husband. This demonstrates terrible, selfish values. It also shows that she thinks of men as sperm donors and child support payers, NOT husbands & fathers. What will happen if you knock her up? Get ready to pay up for a kid that you won't get to be a real dad to.2: In some states, you can be responsible for child support by just living with her. I don't want to pay for kids that aren't mine. Do you?3: False allegations of child abuse. It isn't likely, but I don't want to take that chance. Getting branded with a big "M" on your forehead (For Molester) will WRECK YOUR LIFE. It will never go away. Too big a risk.4: Relationship aren't easy as it is. Add a minor child and it really complicates the issue. Do you want to deal with her kid(s) too? You won't be their dad and they will know it. Their mom already fucked up their life by not having a dad for them, and is fucking it up more by bringing in "Revolving door boyfriends" into their life.5: Lots of single moms have financial problems. You will be obligated to help pay for sitters, food, braces, on and on. For children that aren't yours. Get the credit card out!6: There is NO reason to date one. Millions of women in this country are single with no kids, and in every age range. Go younger if you have to. Don't waste your time with a woman that has PROVEN that she doesn't want a husband for her and dad for her kids. Do you think she will change her mind for you? That she will forget her utter contempt for husbands and fathers just for you? Sure she will.I run into single mothers once in a while, and when "I have a kid" is revealed, that's the end of the conversation for me. I will be polite but I will still walk off, because I don't want anything to do with them. And neither will any other smart man.——————————————————————————–Re: 6 Reasons to NEVER date a Single MotherPost by SoCalPolki101 on Dec 14, 2004, 11:45amHogwash! And rebuttal in defense of single mothers.1: She decided to have a kid…In other words she probably has her childbearing years behind her. Or at least doesn't have a burning desire and need to start a family. UNLIKE the single no kids women out there who have their childbearing years AHEAD of them.2: In some states… living with her…Get your story straight buddy. Look at your subject. Date and living together are two different things.3: False allegations of child abuse. Children in daycare years are asleep by 10PM. That's when you come over with the DVD and wine and cheese.Single mothers with older children usually have arrangements for having men over which do not include contact with children. Like sleepovers at their friends, relatives, etc.You bug out at night because a woman with small children doesn't want them to see you in the morning.4: Relationship aren't easy as it is.Single mothers often want very casual come-on-over occassionaly relationships because their time is limited and schedule chaotic.Single women have lots of free time on their hands. They have all kinds of recreational and emotional needs that need to be met.5: Lots of single moms have financial problems.Bullcrap. Single moms these days live high off the hog. They have jobs and they also get help from dummy who got married and got them pregnant.And it never ceases to amaze how trailer trash can be so happy when you spend $10 at Trader Joes to buy some European delicacies for your late night come on over. $10 is what you'll spend on tips and parking on your single no kids date.6: There is NO reason to date one. Millions of women in this country are single with no kids,That is exactly the reason to date one. Because single women don't have kids and will probably want kids. Even if they say they don't want kids right away, they can't be trusted. Especially if they're in their
Can the Trans and Drag Communities Work Together?In a scene from his recent music video "Mean Gays," performer Shane Jenek, for the moment not dressed as his glamorous drag persona Courtney Act, looks nervously back and forth between a dumbbell and a wig. The video, featuring muscled men alongside Jenek in and out of drag, presents a binary between what is expected of male beauty and feminine beauty, a conflict that Jenek has been wrestling with much of his young adult life."I struggled with my own masculinity, [and] even struggled with my own gender identity over the years," the RuPaul's Drag Race finalist confesses to The Advocate the day after Bianca Del Rio was crowned the season 6 champion. "I felt really torn between my passion, which was doing drag, and wanting to have the right body and have the right look so I could be found sexually desirable."Gender identity is a topic that Jenek discusses a lot, particularly in light of this season of RuPaul's Drag Race, in which the overlapping waters of the drag and transgender communities heated to a boil. This battle has largely been over the authority of the right to use words like "tranny" or "shemale," which many trans activists consider slurs and some drag performers defend as endemic to drag pride and culture. As a result of this battle, Drag Race's network, Logo TV, not only apologized and pulled a controversial episode from its archives — in which contestants had to label close-up photographs as either "female" or "shemale" — but it also went a step further, vowing to remove a popular segment, "You've Got Shemail," which was present from the show's inception, from all future seasons.This act sparked even further resentment and eye-rolling among many past Drag Race fans and cast members. One of them, season 6 champion Bianca Del Rio, told The Advocate, "It's not that serious. It's a drag show on Logo. We dress up. We pretend we're puppets. … Lighten the fuck up.""I'm a Libra, so I see this from both sides," added Adore Delano, a Drag Race season 6 finalist alongside Del Rio and Act. "In high school, I identified as transgender for years, so I personally find it interesting that it took [the transgender community] six years to get offended by that. But, I also see where they're coming from. I think BenDeLaCreme actually said this brilliantly. She said, 'There's so many words in the vocabulary. And if there's one word that you're using that could possibly offend someone, and really offend somebody, than why not just completely wipe it from your vocabulary and use something else.' I get that, but it's like, I see it from both ways. The show is so trans-friendly and so fun, and so campy, that it's like, there's no way you can take that out of context."For Jenek, the debate also hits on issues close to home. His drag performance as Courtney Act, which so dazzled the Drag Race judges, had another effect on some fans in the past, who tried to convince Jenek that his convincing portrayal of a female meant that he must be a transgender woman. Jenek wasn't sure what to think. He remembers bursting into tears one night at the home of a friend because of his conflicted feelings about his gender identity."I was tormented, because I didn't know if I wanted to be a woman or if I wanted to be a man," he recalls.As a result, the native Australian performer, who first rose to fame as a singer on Australian Idol only after slipping into Courtney Act's sequined gown, grew to resent his female persona. He would eschew weightlifting at the gym because he did not want to "look too bulky for Courtney, and kind of blaming Courtney because of that."Today, Jenek no longer feels divided about his gender identity and has come to embrace both masculine and feminine sides. While he now identifies as a gay male, he views gender identity as more of a spectrum, in which he falls "closer to the middle than most.""The majority of people fall in the spectrum. And I think gender is like that as well," he says. "I think we are born a certain sex, but we all express our gender in ways that is transgender."His experiences have led him to seek out more information, sitting down with trans musician Our Lady J to talk about the issue on YouTube. Ultimately, he concluded that the problem wasn't that the topic wasn't serious, but rather, that the conversation between the drag and transgender community was stuck in place."I felt there was a lot of 'we're right, you're wrong,' pushing back and forth, different sides of the argument. And obviously, that language does offend
You can't talk about religious liberty in Texas without mentioning Lester Roloff.In the 1970s, Roloff, a Baptist preacher, was known for his homes for teenagers in Corpus Christi. A 1973 legislative report on child care in the state said members heard testimony from children previously in Roloff's Rebekah Home for Girls about irregular meals and whippings. Roloff told lawmakers his homes should be exempted from state interference due to his religious roots."We spanked them because God loves them, and we love them," Roloff told the committee.Those hearings led to the Legislature passing Senate Bill 965 in 1975, which established child care licensing laws in the state.The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.Now, 42 years later, Texas legislators are considering sharpening religious protections for faith-based groups the state hires to place children in foster and adoptive homes and oversee their care. Critics say this could give religious groups license to use their faith as a reason to refuse to place foster children with gay couples or with families with certain religious beliefs. Legislators say this could halt bipartisan warmth on bills changing how Texas cares for abused and neglected children.Rep. James Frank, R-Wichita Falls, vice chairman of the House Human Services Committee, has authored House Bill 3859, which would protect faith-based providers from retaliation if they assert their "sincerely held religious beliefs" while caring for abused and neglected children.The bill would include allowing faith-based groups to deny a placement if it's against their religious beliefs; place a child in a religion-based school; deny referrals for abortion-related contraceptives, drugs or devices; and refuse to contract with other organizations that go against their religious beliefs.Frank said the his bill is meant to give "reasonable accommodations" for faith-based groups and not meant to be exclusionary. He said the ultimate goal is to help find the right home for kids.Faith-based organizations are closing their doors to foster children "because they can't afford to stay in business when they're getting sued on stuff," Frank said. "They're basically being told to conform or get out on stuff that's important but it's not core to taking care of foster homes."The potential religious liberty fight comes as Texas legislators try to reimagine how to care for vulnerable children and entice more communities to open their homes to them. Part of that strategy includes convincing more faith communities to partner with the state. Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick hosted a Faith Leader Summit in November encouraging congregations to help, and Texas First Lady Cecilia Abbott in January publicly urged religious groups to support foster families with donations and other activities.The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.But Jennifer Allmon, executive director for the Texas Catholic Conference of Bishops, said that Catholic charities based in Texas are wary of continuing as child welfare providers without the protection that HB 3859 could offer. Allmon said some of the 13 such groups in Texas have faced lawsuits for not taking a young woman to get an abortion or not putting children in gay and lesbian households. For now, she said, the legislation's fate would be a "critical factor" in how Catholic Charities decides to move forward with the state."It's about recognizing the role of the faith-based provider and not extending beyond our role," Allmon said. "We're asked to come forward and serve in this system because of our faith and our values and our mission."She pointed out that Catholic charities in California, the District of Columbia, Illinois and Massachusetts closed their foster care services when lawmakers did not pass religious protections for them. Right now, some of the groups in Texas have suspended services temporarily to see what the Legislature does about added protections.Chuck Smith, CEO of Equality Texas, an LGBT rights group, said he was scared of HB 3859 after watching similar legislation become law in Michigan, North Dakota, South Dakota and Virginia. He said Frank's bill allows the possibility of children being denied services because of what a provider believes and that would not fly if it were any other state contractor."Any piece of legislation that would allow the personal or religious beliefs of a provider to override the best interest of the child is misplaced and I would suggest is a gross change in what religious liberty actually means," Smith said.It's unclear if HB 3859 will make it to the House floor, but there are rumblings among legislators that it could be tacked onto another child welfare measure, House Bill 6, as an amendment. That bill, also by Frank, would overhaul the child welfare system by allowing more contracted organizations to monitor children in foster care.Rep. Eddie Rodriguez, D-Austin, a member of the Texas House's Child Protective Services work group, said Democrats have always been open to more faith-based organization involvement but that a religious liberty amendment would allow such groups to discriminate. He
How to Fix a Leaking Bottling BucketLike other reviewers, my bottling bucket leaked a little bit as well. However, I solved the problem with these five simple steps:_x000D__x000D_1) take apart the spigot, remove it from the bucket, and remove the rubber/foam gaskets (aka washers); wrap plastic thread tape (like plumbers use) around the length of the threads at least 10 times;_x000D__x000D_2) place 1 gasket on the spigot, then insert the spigot through the hole in the bucket, and then place on the 2nd gasket (so you have 1 gasket on the outside of the bucket, and a 2nd gasket on the inside of the bucket);_x000D__x000D_3) turn the spigot upside down, then hand-tighten the plastic nut as much as possible on the inside of the bucket;_x000D__x000D_4) holding the plastic nut, rotate the spigot on the outside of the bucket 180 degrees to face down, in order to finish tightening the plastic nut. Be careful not to overtighten to the point where the plastic threads give out and release tension on the nut (although the plastic thread tape seems to prevent this); and_x000D__x000D_5) Partially fill the bottling bucket above the level of the spigot, dry the outside of the bottling bucket and place it on dry cardboard to test. No seepage after 15 minutes means you succeeded in fixing your leaking bottling bucket. If you have a wet ring on the cardboard, add more plastic thread tape, and/or adjust the starting angle of the spigot even more than 180 degrees in order to get a tighter fit. For example, after you hand-tighten the plastic nut, you may need to turn the spigot a complete revolution (i.e. 360 degrees) in order to finish tightening.

This invigorates the two, and Conis makes a vow to get Usopp and Sanji better soon. The Bilkans chase the Shandia to the Upper Ruins. Enel smiles as his prophecy is about to come true. Wiper attacks Gan Fall. Nola attacks Wiper. Wiper shoots Nola with his bazooka, but it does not work. Ohm explains how his sword works to Zoro and then splits up with Holy to finish everyone off faster. Several Bilkans come to Ohm's aid while several Shandia come to Wiper's aid. Aisa and Nami appear on the Waver being chased by Bilkians and for a second Wiper and Zoro join forces, destroying the Bilkians. They then begin fighting again. Gan Fall and Pierre rescue Nami and Aisa from the fight only to be swallowed by Nola. Holy and Ohm attack Wiper and Zoro when their guard is down and both of them fall to the ground.Long Summary EditAlong the northwestern shore of Upper Yard, Conis and Pagaya ponder how they will defend the Going Merry while waiting at the meeting spot Nami had previously designated. They ultimately decide to blow the horn from their dial boat to ward off any potential threats. Conis attends to the still injured Sanji and Usopp, while Pagaya silently hopes for everyone's safety in light of the perilous events that have gripped Sky Island. Throughout the forest, the ground is littered with all the Shandia and Enforcers of God's Army that have fallen over the course of the survival game, as they continue to wage war with one another. While the Shandia are still pushing to make it to the Giant Beanstalk, the Enforcers desperately regroup in order to repel them. Enel himself is enjoying the chaos, content that his prediction of the survival game is shaping up to come true.On the beanstalk itself, the battle between Gan Fall, Zoro, Ohm, Wiper, and the Giant Snake continues to rage on. Wiper lands a direct hit to the snake with his Burn Bazooka, but is shocked that it is to no avail. The blow does still cause quite a bit of commotion inside the snake, sending Luffy toppling and causing him to wonder whats going on. Zoro grimaces in pain from a hit he took, as he rises to his feet. Ohm berates him for being a blue sea dweller that knows nothing, as he explains that his blade is actually the result of an iron cloud dial built into the hilt of the sword. It allows the blade to follow its target anywhere, which he then demonstrates by extending it all the way to Zoro from several meters away. Zoro blocks the attack with ease, commenting on the whip-like nature of the sword and how the warriors of the White Cloud Seas are like a bunch of circus performers.Sensing new arrivals to the battlefield, Ohm tells Holy that they will now be splitting up. As predicted, both Shandia and God's Army Enforcers soon join them on the battlefield. The Shandia inform Wiper that they are the only ones left, and reaffirm their determination to help Wiper get to Enel. Inside the snake, Luffy decides to try to dig his way out, and begins clawing into the walls. In actuality he is tickling the snake, and the spectators are extremely confused to see the snake laughing hysterically. Just then, Nami and Aisa also burst through the clouds below as they continue riding up the beanstalk. The Enforcers attempt to chase them down, but are repelled by a combined effort from Zoro, Wiper, and Gan Fall. Zoro and Wiper ask Nami and Aisa respectively what they are doing here. As Nami asks Zoro where the others are, Wiper prepares a shot at Nami, wondering what she plans to do to Aisa. As he fires the blast, Gan Fall manages to get Nami and Aisa to safety aboard Pierre. This is short-lived however, as the the snake swallows all four of them in one bite, much to Zoro's horror. As Zoro and Wiper try to process what just
Most economists agree that advances in robotics and AI over the next few decades are likely to lead to significant job losses. But what's less often considered is how these changes could also impact social mobility. A new report from UK charity Sutton Trust explains the danger, noting that unless governments take action, the next wave of automation will dramatically increase inequality within societies, further entrenching the divide between rich and poor.The are a number of reasons for this, say the report's authors, including the ability of richer individuals to re-train for new jobs; the rising importance of "soft skills" like communication and confidence; and the reduction in the number of jobs used as "stepping stones" into professional industries."Traditionally, jobs like these have been a vehicle for social mobility."For example, the demand for paralegals and similar professions is likely to be reduced over the coming years as artificial intelligence is trained to handle more administrative tasks. In the UK more than 350,000 paralegals, payroll managers, and bookkeepers could lose their jobs if automated systems can do the same work."Traditionally, jobs like these have been a vehicle for social mobility," Sutton Trust research manager Carl Cullinane tells The Verge. Cullinane says that for individuals who weren't able to attend university or get particular qualifications, semi-administrative jobs are often a way in to professional industries. "But because they don't require more advanced skills they're likely to be vulnerable to automation," he says.Similarly, as automation reduces the need for administrative skills, other attributes will become more sought after in the workplace. These include so-called "soft skills" like confidence, motivation, communication, and resilience. "It's long established that private schools put a lot of effort into making sure their pupils have those sorts of skills," says Cullinane. "And these will become even more important in a crowded labor market."Re-training for new jobs will also become a crucial skill, and it's individuals from wealthier backgrounds that are more able to do so, says the report. This can already be seen in the disparity in terms of post-graduate education, with individuals in the UK with working class or poorer backgrounds far less likely to re-train after university.The report, which was carried out by the Boston Consulting Group and published this Wednesday, looks specifically at the UK, where it says some 15 million jobs are at risk of automation. But the Sutton Trust says its findings are also relevant to other developed nations, particularly the US, where social mobility is a major problem.Social mobility is already a big problem in AmericaOne study in 2016 found that America has become significantly less conducive to social mobility over the past few decades. "It is increasingly the case that no matter what your educational background is, where you start has become increasingly important for where you end," one of the study's authors, Michael D. Carr, told The Atlantic last year. Another report found that around half of 30-year-olds in the US earn less than their parents at the same age, compared to the 1970s, when almost 90 percent earned more.It's important to note, though, that there is disagreement about how bad the impact of automation on the job market will be. Some reports have suggested that up to 50 percent of jobs in developed countries are at risk, while others point out that only specific tasks will be automated — rather than whole professions. Economists also note that new categories of jobs are likely to be created, although exactly what, and how many, is impossible to accurately predict.The Sutton Trust report also says that there is some reason to be optimistic about the coming wave of automation, particularly if governments can encourage people to train for STEM professions (those involving science, technology, engineering, and mathematics)."From a social mobility perspective there are two important things about the STEM sector," says Cullinane of the UK job market. "Firstly, there doesn't seem to be a substantial gap in the income background of people taking STEM related subjects, and secondly, there isn't a resulting pay gap for those who come from different backgrounds. If the STEM sector is going to be the main source of growth over the medium to long term, that's a real opportunity to leverage social mobility there."

Bills safety Aaron Williams insists Jairus Byrd wants to return to Buffalo despite the riches awaiting the three-time Pro Bowl selection as one of the most coveted players on the open market.Byrd has obvious connections to the Philadelphia Eagles, Cleveland Browns and Tampa Bay Buccaneers, but those won't be the only teams interested in his services.A person informed of the team's thinking tells NFL Media Insider Ian Rapoport that the St. Louis Rams were among the teams that reached out to Byrd's camp Saturday.Rapoport calls the Rams' contact with Byrd "unexpected and interesting."With young starters T.J. McDonald and Rodney McLeod returning, the position was not believed to be a high priority. We suspect the Rams envision Byrd as a major playmaking upgrade on McLeod at free safety.Byrd turned down a Bills contract offer that would've made him the highest-paid safety for a portion of his deal, according to Rapoport.If Sam Shields' lucrative new pact is any indication of the market for Byrd, he's not going to regret rejecting his former team.Rapoport also reported that the Miami Dolphins, looking to make a big splash in free agency for the second straight offseason, are also "expressing real interest" in Byrd.The latest "Around The League Podcast" picks the biggest free agent bargains and plays the revolutionary game: "Get my lunch."
"The taste of the famous Halifax Donair finally comes to Quebec for the first time ever! This is the REAL HALIFAX DONAIR." This, the promise made by Donair Cité owner Todd Langseth last November. Alas, the Maritime spin on Turkish-style doner made popular in Atlantic Canada at the likes of King of Donair and Greco, failed to resonate in shawarma, shish taouk, and souvlaki saturated Montreal. A Chowhound tipster reports that Donair Cité is now closed. The restaurant's Facebook page is down and calls to Donair Cité's number were not answered today.Langseth's former, anti-Parti Québécois activism came back to haunt him this past February. The Doner Cité principal told a reporter at the time that his restaurant had become a target for online trolls and, specifically, "fake reviews, all-out lies about myself, slanderous remarks." All this after it was revealed that Langseth had once administered an 'I Hate Pauline Marois' Facebook group.Update, Saturday, October 17, 2015: Reports of Donair Cité's demise were premature, it seems. After a short hiatus, the Haligonian twist on classic Turkish doner has relocated to the Gay Village, and specifically, to the former Café Crêperie En Couleur. The restaurant has a new name, Halifax Donair, a remade Facebook page, and even has plans to expand.Owner Todd Langseth took to Facebook to correct the record: "We are NOT closed. We moved from that toilette [sic] of a sector on St Denis, into not one, but TWO new locations. The concept exploded in popularity, to the point where not just more space was required, but more locations. We're actively seeking our third location somewhere in the NDG/Montreal West area. We are currently located at 1212 De Maisoneuve [sic], and 5171 Avenue du Parc."

It has advanced radar, forward-looking infrared cameras, and laser rangefinders—all used to help the 13-man crew direct a barrage of lethal fire to the ground from 12,000 feet. But for all of this advanced technology, the vision of the U.S. Air Force Special Operations Command gunships can be thwarted by the threatening adversary known as a cloudy sky.Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowThe Air Force has a solution: Launch a small unmanned aircraft from the gunship to drop below the cloud cover and serve as the eyes of the AC-130's crew. Special Operations officials last year spoke publicly about using a drone called the Coyote—the wings of the Coyote unfold as the drone launches from a six-inch-wide tube. A higher-endurance version is in development.Weapons are getting smarter and drones are getting smaller, and pretty soon it will be hard to tell the difference. "The main weakness of sUAS [small unmanned aircraft systems] is range," says U.S. Air Force Brigadier General Alexus Grynkewich, deputy director for operations at the National Joint Operations and Intelligence Center and coauthor of a recently released Pentagon study called "Air Superiority 2030 Flight Plan." "You need some delivery method to get them close."Grynkewich sees the engineering challenge as a series of trade-offs. A heavier engine increases a drone's range, but the airplane that launches it isn't able to carry as many. The amount of sophistication on the sensor adds expense to the drone, which may be lost in battle. And the wingspan is limited by the hardware on the airplane. Despite these complexities, the Air Force sees smart but disposable aircraft as an important solution: Airpower is a game of threat and response. One side makes a powerful radar array, the other creates stealth warplanes that can fly undetected. By the time the new airplane is ready to meet the old threat, a new one has emerged. It's a lot easier, cheaper, and faster, however, to redesign a drone than an entire airplane. "The idea is to have a tech refresh fielded in months instead of years," says Reid Melville, strategy lead for unmanned systems at the Air Force Research Laboratory at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. "That way, when we get surprised, we will have the infrastructure in place to make a rapid change."Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowExcept when it comes to singing The Righteous Brothers songs in bars, this new generation of drones promises to be the perfect wingman. They make no mistakes and have no emotion. And if the situation demands it, they are willing sacrifices. There is one big difference, however: Like soldiers, drones will always deserve gratitude. Unlike soldiers, however, they'll never deserve a funeral.The ArsenalSeven of the most promising designs right now.Miniature Air-Launched Decoy (MALD)•MALD is a trailblazer. In the mid-1990s DARPA started researching this small jet-engine-powered craft, fired from a warplane's wing, that could fly along GPS waypoints and emit signals to mimic a full-size aircraft. Hidden air-defense systems shoot at MALD and expose themselves to counterattack. After a stutter-step start, the technology caught up with the idea and in 2009 Raytheon delivered the first MALD to the Air Force. Recent upgrades include a carbon-composite fuselage that lightens the airframe. An upcoming datalink ability will enable pilots to reprogram MALD's flight path after launch.•Status: Currently deployed.Ryan InzanaCoyote•Dropped from an airplane, these disposable drones are launched from a six-inch tube and unfold in flight. They are currently launched from National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration airplanes to study hurricanes. The Air Force special-ops folks have converted them for use on gunships, to aim at targets obscured by clouds.•Status: Currently deployed.Air-Launched, Tube-Integrated, Unmanned System (ALTIUS)Drones such as the Coyote can stay airborne for only an hour. The USAF tactical off-board sensing program wants a drone that can provide continuous surveillance coverage for at least four. So they came up with ALTIUS. It has a state-of-the-art, high-energy-density power system that can withstand harsh environmental conditions, does not pose an explosive hazard, and can be stored for more than six months. It uses a highly efficient, lightweight carbon-composite airframe, and its slender shape is designed to fit in a six- to eight-inch launch tube.Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below•Status: In development.

Japan on Tuesday ended a two-year nuclear shutdown in the energy-hungry country, sparked by public fears following the 2011 Fukushima crisis, the worst atomic disaster in a generation.Utility Kyushu Electric Power turned on a reactor at Sendai, about 1,000 kilometres (620 miles) southwest of Tokyo, at 10:30 am (0130 GMT).The 31-year-old reactor -- operating under tougher post-Fukushima safety rules -- was expected to reach full capacity around 11:00 pm Tuesday and would start generating power by Friday.Commercial operations are to begin early next month, a company spokesman said.The restart comes more than four years after a quake-sparked tsunami triggered meltdowns at the Fukushima plant, prompting the shutdown of Japan's stable of reactors and setting off a pitched battle over the future use of atomic power.The accident sent radiation over a wide area and forced tens of thousands of people from their homes -- many of whom will likely never return.Decommissioning of the crippled Fukushima reactors is expected to take decades with compensation expenses -- excluding the cost of the site's clean up -- now topping $57 billion.Anti-nuclear sentiment still runs high in Japan and television showed protesters scuffling with police in front of the Sendai plant, which is on the southernmost main island of Kyushu.Local media said about 200 protesters gathered at the site, including former prime minister Naoto Kan who has become a high-profile anti-nuclear activist.The resource-poor nation, which once relied on nuclear power for a quarter of its electricity, restarted two reactors temporarily to feed its needs after Fukushima. But they both went offline by September 2013, making Japan completely nuclear-free for about two years.The country has ushered in stricter safety regulations to avoid a repeat of the accident, including more backup prevention measures and higher tsunami-blocking walls in some areas."It is important to restart reactors one by one from the perspective of energy security, the economy and measures against global warming, but safety always comes first," Industry Minister Yoichi Miyazawa told reporters.If another atomic accident happened, he added, the government would "deal with it responsibly".Beefed-up safety measures are key to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's bid to get some of about four dozen reactors back up and running, as Tokyo's energy policy sets its sights on nuclear accounting for as much as 22 percent of Japan's energy needs by 2030.Power companies that own them are also keen for more restarts, fed up with having to make up lost generating capacity with pricey fossil fuels.Japan's post-Fukushima energy bill skyrocketed as it scrambled to fill the gap left by taking reactors offline, pushing the country into successive trade deficits.Those expenses were exacerbated by a sharp weakening of the yen, which pushed up costs for energy imports paid for in other currencies, particularly the US dollar.Several other reactors have received a safety green light from officials, but battle lines have been drawn with many local communities strongly opposed to restarts.Takashi Kato, professor emeritus at Tokyo's Seikei University, was critical of Tuesday's restart, saying Abe's close business ties were trumping safety concerns."Abe is not listening to the voice of the people -- he is acting as if he has been given a blank cheque," Kato said."It is big business demanding a stable supply of power by resuming nuclear reactors, not the general public."Safety officials have stressed that any switched-on reactor would operate under much tighter regulations than those that existed before Fukushima, the worst atomic disaster since Chernobyl in 1986."A disaster like that at Tokyo Electric Power's Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant will not occur," under the new rules, Nuclear Regulation Authority (NRA) chairman Shunichi Tanaka said in an interview with the Nikkei newspaper published at the weekend.But Tanaka conceded there was "no such thing as absolute safety", and Japan's people are sceptical as the country remains deeply scarred by the legacy of Fukushima.Short link:
In a country where racial classifications create social hierarchies that assert the superiority of white skin and Caucasian features, and the inferiority of "black" skin and Asian features, interracial and interethnic couples in Lebanon are abhorred, stigmatized and socially ostracised."I'm a stranger in my own country," Saeb Kayali, a Thai-Lebanese, told Al-Akhbar."Demeaning gestures, head-shaking, stares, and under-the-breath comments are the most passive of the reactions we get in public," "I remember once a woman asked my friend, who happened to be right next to me, if I spoke Arabic," Kayali said, "And I always get questions like 'Where are you from? Lebanon. No, where are you really from? Ummm, Lebanon. No, like where are your parents originally from?' And even after I explicitly tell them that I'm Lebanese they just continue asking."As Kayali narrated countless instances of "misunderstandings," Lebanon's racial bigotry, whether conscious or unconscious, and the long-ingrained notions of racial inequality, are very clearly present in today's society.Power institutions, including the societal body, are not only combating interfaith marriages but also interracial ones. While the need to overcome the former has vigorously surfaced in the last few years, the latter is still to be acknowledged and defied.Blatant racism"Demeaning gestures, head-shaking, stares, and under-the-breath comments are the most passive of the reactions we get in public," Pi, a Filipina woman married to a Lebanese man, told Al-Akhbar.Racial intolerance in Lebanon has caused the alienation of mixed-race couples from family members, who disown them for marrying someone they consider to be 'inferior.' People of African or Asian heritage are automatically associated with allegedly 'inferior' domestic workers by virtue of their phenotype, and their identity is accordingly erased and replaced by an array of racist stereotypes."At first we didn't even hold hands in public. Then I asked him how is it okay for others to express hatred but not for us to express love?" Pi added, "now we act like any endogamous couple and if someone is disturbed he or she can simply look away.""His family didn't speak to him for five years," Pi said, "they didn't even know me, but my Filipina features were more than enough reason for them to disapprove of our marriage."According to Rana Boukarim, spokeswoman for the Anti Racism Movement in Lebanon, "Many families eventually come to accept the interracial marriages, which may be seen as a decrease in racism. However, when questioned, these family members, who were initially against the idea, often say 'but she is different from other Filipinas'."Moreover, couples who are driven by love to cross the color line face socially-constructed derision because they, and their mixed-race children, provoke the invisible yet existing laws of racial segregation."They used to call me Oreo""I remember one time, light-skinned Lebanese students refused to sit next to an Afro-Lebanese kid because they thought his dark skin color was 'contagious' and they feared they would turn black." Mixed-race children face blatant racism at school as their fellow classmates fail to censor their speech. While interracial couples are mentally and psychologically aware of notions of race and the difficulties that might be ahead in ethnically homogenous communities, their children are not."Back in preschool, kids used to call me 'blacky' or 'Oreo' as if my skin color is my name and identity," Walid Yassine, a 22-year-old Congolese-Lebanese told Al-Akhbar."I was called 'the Chinese kid'," Kayali said, "even though I'm not half Chinese to begin with."Thrust into a world of racial stereotyping, mixed-race children experience disparities in self-esteem, self-degradation, and identity-related struggles. Unless the child is aware of his or her mixed heritage, overcoming the internal turmoil that could result from such confusion could take a lifetime."I felt different and I knew I looked different but I didn't understand why I was treated differently," Gabi Kheil, a 24-year-old Gabonese-Lebanese told Al-Akhbar.According to Charles Nasrallah, founder and director of Insan Association, when introducing an Afro-Lebanese to a class full of light-skinned Lebanese children the first reaction has always been very aggressive and abusive."We've had incidents where the students would spit on the dark-skinned kid
Since Afreeca Freecs' top laner Jang "MaRin" Gyeong-hwan pulled out the splitpushing AD Kennen during the very early stages of Season 7, Kennen has been all the rage internationally as a viable splitpusher and aggressive presence in the top lane that had difficulty dying to tanks. This is still true, as Kennen can very easily scale thanks to the lack of kill pressure that tanks generally have.With the new midseason patch and attempt to shift kill pressure away from tanks once more, Kennen has continued to be a staple pick in the top lane against top lane champions just hoping to get out of the lane phase without a huge disadvantage. Kennen is a great bully and an even better scaling champion, letting his splitpush plan come to fruition and carry the game alone, if given enough room.Runes1 Attack Speed and 8 Attack Damage Reds, Armor Yellows, 3 Attack Speed and 6 Magic Resistance Blues, Attack Speed QuintessencesThis rune page gives you a good balance of resistances, attack damage, and attack speed. Because of Kennen's W passive, he's more inclined to specialize in attack speed earlier, and more attack speed increases his sustain through Doran's Blade as well as his initial Blade of the Ruined King buy, making his dueling much better in the early and mid game stages.MasteriesEighteen in Ferocity is pretty standard for auto attacking threats. Kennen has great synergy with Fervor of battle in particular, as the attack damage contributes to his W passive, which will give him greater burst damage as he builds up the empowered auto attack. Fresh Blood and Battle Trance help with laning without a downside, and Kennen needs the armor penetration over the magic penetration for his Blade of the Ruined King damage onto tanks despite his tendency to do slightly more magic damage (thanks to creeps having low magic resistance) over the course of the game.Twelve in Resolve keeps Kennen alive and allows him to threaten the splitpush much more often thanks to the use of Insight. Insight should be taken over Fearless because Kennen already gets a good chunk of resistances in fights through his E, making more resistance suboptimal versus having health to balance it out. As well, having Flash and Teleport up more often allows Kennen to make cross-map plays and use the utility of flash to escape sticky splitpush or teamfight situations. Veteran Scars and Tough Skin help optimize his early resistances and contributes to a brutal laning phase for the opponent as trading becomes more and more fruitless.Skill OrderFirst six levels: QEWWWRGetting Q first is the best harass tool, and E afterwards helps escape any early cheese from the top laner or jungler. After, however, W is the skill you want to max. It helps with waveclear in conjunction with E, and actually scales with your total attack damage, increasing by level. This is AD Kennen's primary tool for dueling as it provides huge burst in lane in combination with an active W.After that, maxing E second helps with waveclear and gives you access to your escape much more often, making your splitpush a lot safer. Your ultimate should be leveled when possible, and your Q should be leveled last despite its early point as a harass tool.Build OrderThough Doran's Shield got a huge buff, it's still not a great choice for champions hoping to bully their lane as Kennen would. Rushing Blade of the Ruined King is a must, even though it got its cost very very slightly increased. After that, going Frozen Mallet will ensure that you will have the survivability and kiting ability to deal with any tank or fighter hoping to contest your presence in a side lane. Phantom Dancer adds to your attack speed and continues to help your survivability for a very low cost. Death's Dance got an insane buff in Patch 7.9 that helps Kennen's dueling substantially, and contributes to his W passive more than any other AD item given it having 80 attack damage. Guardian Angel helps as well, as it also now gives attack damage.Doran's Blade + Health Potion Blade of the Ruined King Mercury Treads Frozen Mallet Phantom Dancer Death's Dance Guardian Angel Maw of Malmortius or Runaan's HurricanePlaystyleEarly game, Kennen's ranged advantage lends itself well to a favorable laning phase because he can easily harass and cs simultaneously. That combined with his good base damage on abilities allows him to trade against the patterns of most meta top laners. Kennen is fairly gankable, so make sure you're not pushing in. If you are, your ultimate is a good get out of jail free card as it will stun pursuers as you scurry away. Early game is not when the splitpushing starts, after all.
This week on The Milo Yiannopoulos Show, Milo sat down with John McAfee, the computer programmer and Libertarian Party presidential candidate.Dubbed "America's most entertaining cybersecurity expert" by TechCrunch, McAfee is an expert in attracting attention, often in hilarious or unusual ways. From hacking a Fox News host live on air to producing viral videos on how to uninstall his own famous anti-virus software, he has never shied away from the spotlight.He also owns 10 guns, claims to have information that implicates the President of Belize in extra-judicial killings, and, according to the IB Times, regularly lives "off-grid," avoiding the US power grid or any technology that could be used to track him.As a candidate for the Libertarian Party nomination, he's emphasised surveillance issues, in particular the vast quantities of personal data that are now stored online.

1. Cold or frigid?Photo: Niq Scott, FlickrStepping out of your door on a chilly winter's morning, you realise that you haven't got nearly enough layers on, and through your chattering teeth you exclaim, "Ich bin kalt!"But what you thought was an innocent enough exclamation actually has other implications - you'll unwittingly be announcing to everyone that you are frigid.To avoid being the laughing stock, don't forget that all-important reflexive pronoun - make sure you say "mir ist kalt" instead.2. Cherries or churches?Photo: strollerdos, FlickrIt's a beautiful afternoon and you're feeling peckish, so what better way to fit right in with the locals than to enjoy the Austrian custom of "Kaffee und Kuchen" (coffee and cake)?Don't make the rookie error of ordering "ein Kuchen mit Kirchen" instead of "ein Kuchen mit Kirschen".Order the latter and you'll get a delicious cake with cherries on top. Order the former (a cake with churches on top) and you'll be met with utter confusion.3. Just fine or the best thing since sliced bread?Photo: Vladimir Pustovit, FlickrResponding cheerily "ich bin gut" to the question "wie geht's?" ("how are you?") could make you seem rather arrogant as opposed to conveying that you are well.Declaring "ich bin gut" indicates that you are morally upstanding, highly skilled, and a shining star all round, whereas "mir geht's gut" means the rather more modest "I'm fine".Yep, it's another case of remembering that reflexive pronoun. Ah grammar, how we love you.4. Cross the road or crucify the road?Photo: Thomas Szynkiewicz, FlickrAlthough "das Kreuz" means "a cross", using the verb "kreuzigen" to refer to crossing the street is a big no-no: you'll inadvertently be saying that you want to crucify the road.Get the correct verb down in your vocab book - it's "überqueren".5. Tasty or laughable?Photo: Anastasia Liem, FlickrEven the best of intentions can sometimes go awry. Eagerly telling your Austrian hosts at dinner, "Das Essen ist lächerlich!", will not have the desired effect.Instead of expressing gratitude for such a delicious meal, you will instead be saying that the food is laughable or even ridiculous.Insulting your hosts will not win you any brownie points, so to avoid getting off on the wrong foot with them, choose the adjective "lecker" instead - you'll charm them in no time.6. Friend or girlfriend?Photo: Brett Sayer, FlickrLinguistically, the lines between purely platonic friendships and romantic relationships can often be blurred in German, as the word "Freund" can signify either a friend or a boyfriend.If you want to escape the minefield of accidentally implying romantic interest when there is none whatsoever, use "ein Freund von mir" instead.7. Mist or dung?Photo: Pimthida, FlickrIt's a grey and miserable morning, and swathes of mist greet you as you walk out of your door.Exclaiming "es gibt so viel Mist!" will not convey that there is a great cloud of mist stifling the air, but rather that there is a lot of dung strewn about, so it's best to avoid this word unless you're on a farm.But in spoken German, "Mist" has another meaning - it's a swearword that you'll hear people on the railway station platform muttering angrily when they miss their train. When you start swearing in German, that's when you know you've moved well and truly past the novice stage and become a true local.8. Gift or poison?Photo: Andrew Kuznetsov, FlickrWant to make a good first impression?Enthusiastically offering your host family a "Gift" upon arriving in Austria is definitely the wrong way to go about it, as this false friend means "poison".In your eagerness to be polite and to express your gratitude, you'll be offering them a present which is worlds apart from the tea and chocolate they expected.If you'd rather not muck up the very first encounter you have in Austria, use the word "das Geschenk" instead.9.

LeeVester BrownThe state Supreme Court has ordered a new trial for a Mississippi man convicted by testimony citing the now-disputed Shaken Baby Syndrome.Justices concluded the trial judge wrongly denied LeeVester Brown's request for the funds to hire an expert to review the autopsy conducted by Dr. Steven Hayne, who concluded the child's death was a homicide consistent with the syndrome. Brown is now serving a life without parole sentence.It's the second case the high court has tossed in recent months involving the Shaken Baby Syndrome. Since 2000, at least 11 Mississippians have been convicted in such cases with two of them sitting on death row.One of them is Jeffrey Havard, who was convicted in 2002 after Hayne told jurors the death of 6-month-old Chloe Britt was a homicide and that her injuries were consistent with her being shaken to death — a claim he now doubts."This case does fundamentally recognize if you don't have an expert, your hands are tied," said Havard's lawyer, Graham Carner of Jackson. "The science has changed."For decades, Shaken Baby Syndrome was widely accepted, diagnosed through a triad of symptoms: subdural bleeding (blood collecting between the brain and the skull), retinal bleeding (bleeding in the back of the eye) and brain swelling.In the years since, medical belief that these symptoms provided iron-clad proof of homicide has begun to crumble with several studies raising doubts.In 2009, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended the syndrome diagnosis be replaced with "abusive head trauma."Hayne told The Clarion-Ledger earlier this year that there was "growing evidence" his shaken baby diagnosis in the Havard case was "probably not correct" because shaking alone isn't able to generate enough force to cause such injuries.Like Brown, Havard sought funds for an expert in his case."This case is a trend nationwide and in Mississippi with Shaken Baby Syndrome being placed under the microscope," Carner said. "The question is how do you handle forensic science in shaken baby cases?"Last week, the state Supreme Court threw out Brown's 2006 conviction in Coahoma County because the judge failed to provide him funds to hire an expert.Lawyers for the state of Mississippi had argued Brown was too late to challenge the Shaken Baby Syndrome because he failed to bring it up at trial.Justices disagreed, saying Brown "is arguing that the Shaken Baby Syndrome theory is invalid, and he argues he simply had no way to challenge that theory without his own expert."In 2002, Brown and Shirley Myles married and had a son, Le'Anthony, who was born six weeks' premature.On March 28, 2003, Myles gave their 6-month-old son a bottle containing milk and cereal at 1:25 p.m. before returning to work.About 10 minutes later, she testified she got a call from Brown, telling her to return home because Le'Anthony had choked on some milk, was having trouble breathing, and they needed to take him to the emergency room.A helicopter arrived at the Clarksdale hospital at 5:40 p.m. to transport the baby by helicopter to University of Mississippi Medical Center. A minute after taking off, the child went into cardiac arrest and died.Hospital personnel let Brown hold Le'Anthony. Myles came in later and held him, too.Hayne conducted the autopsy, concluding the death was a homicide, and police questioned Brown."I don't know what happened," he told them. "I know I didn't do nothing to him. I didn't harm him in no kind of way — no kind of way at all. When they come up with this shaken, I don't know. The only thing I know, I did not harm him."When detectives told Brown his story didn't "match up" with what happened to Le'Anthony, he replied that he didn't care what they said, he did not harm his son.The police handcuffed Brown and took him to jail. He was unable to attend his son's funeral.With the help of family and friends, he finally posted $75,000 bond and was able to hire a lawyer.But he said he still couldn't afford to hire an expert pathologist to examine the autopsy.Prosecutors called the defense's request a "fishing expedition," and the judge denied it.At trial, the emergency room physician said she did not notice any bruises, abrasions, scars or anything else abnormal.Myles testified she never saw any evidence of abuse or Brown "getting rough" with Le'Anthony.Hayne told jurors the child's death was a homicide and that it "would take the violent shaking of a child to produce these types of injuries."
"I started wondering if maybe they had forgotten a part of the bottle, but also thought it would have been unlikely that they could have missed such a big thing inside my cheek," Moberg told the paper.

ABOMINATION OF DESOLATION:Table of Contents —In Rabbinical Literature:An expression occurring in Matt. xxiv. 15 and Mark, xiii. 14 (A. V.), where the Greek text has τὸ βδέλυγμα τῆς έρημώσεως. The Greek itself, however, is referable to a Hebrew expression, , found in Dan. ix. 27 (where the ם of has been added, through a copyist's error, from the מ of the ensuing word); in Dan. xi. 31, and in Dan. xii. 11 (with omission of the prefixed מ).The context of these passages leaves no room for doubt as to what was intended by this somewhat odd expression; namely, the transformation, by Antiochus Epiphanes, of the sacred Temple at Jerusalem into a heathen one. In both Biblical and rabbinical Hebrew abomination is a familiar term for an idol (I Kings, xi. 5; II Kings, xxiii. 13; Sifra, Ḳedoshim, beginning, and Mekilta, Mishpatim, xx. ed. Weiss, 107), and therefore may well have the same application in Daniel, which should accordingly be rendered, in agreement with Ezra, ix. 3, 4, "motionless abomination" or, also, "appalling abomination." The suggestion of many scholars-Hoffmann, Nestle, Bevan, and others—that , as a designation for Jupiter is simply an intentional perversion of his usual appellation "Baal Shamem" ( , "lord of heaven") is quite plausible, as is attested by the perversion of "Beelzebub" into "Βεελζεβούλ" (Greek version) in Mark, iii. 22, as well as the express injunction found in Tosef., 'Ab. Zarah, vi. (vii) and Babli 'Ab. Zarah, 46a, that the names of idols may be pronounced only in a distorted or abbreviated form (see the examples quoted there). Though the expression "Abomination of Desolation" is accordingly recognizedin the light of this interpretation as a mistranslation of the phrase used in Daniel, there is no doubt that in the circles directly influenced by the Book of Daniel—the same circles that originated the apocalyptic literature—the expression was employed to designate an important eschatological conception. For it is only in an eschatological sense that the expression can be adequately explained in the New Testament passages above mentioned.According to most modern commentators, these passages are a Jewish apocalypse, somewhat tinged with Christianity, intended to prophesy the end of time, when the Antichrist, as the Abomination of Desolation, shall be enthroned as a ruler in God's Temple. The closely related "smaller Apocalypse" in II Thess. ii. 1-12 is a conclusive justification of this view; for it shows that neither the Romans (as Weiss in his commentary, ad loc., holds), nor the Zealots (Bleek, "Synoptische Erklärung," and others), nor Caligula with his self-deification (Spitta, in his "Offenbarung Johannis") can be intended.The rabbis as a whole consider that the expression refers to the desecration of the Temple by the erection of a Zeus statue in its sacred precincts by Antiochus Epiphanes (see Apostemos ). Some rabbis, however, see in it an allusion to Manasseh, who, as related in II Chron. xxxiii. 7, set up "a carved image . . . in the house of God" (Yer. Ta'anit, iv. 68a, and Rashi on the passage in Babli, ibid. 28b). The Haggadah narrates that two statues were erected, one of which fell over upon the other and broke off its hand. Upon the severed hand the following inscription was found engraved: "I sought to destroy God's house, but Thou didst lend Thy hand to its protection" (Ta'anit, 28b et seq.; compare Rabbinovicz, "Variæ Lectiones," on the passage for variant readings).Bibliography: Compare modern commentators—Meinhold, Bevan, Weiss, Prince—upon the passages in Daniel and Matthew;also Bousset, Der Antichrist, English translation, 1896, especially index;Spitta, Offenbarung Johannis, pp. 493-497;Grätz, Gesch. d. Juden, iv. note 15;Chajes, Markus-Studien, p. 72.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Hundreds of people including opposition politicians protested outside the trial of two prominent Turkish journalists facing life in prison on espionage charges on Friday, hours after President Tayyip Erdogan denied curbing press freedoms.Can Dundar, editor-in-chief of Cumhuriyet (L), accompanied by his Ankara bureau chief Erdem Gul, arrives at the Justice Palace for his trial in Istanbul, Turkey April 1, 2016. REUTERS/Osman OrsalCan Dundar, editor-in-chief of the Cumhuriyet newspaper, and Ankara bureau chief Erdem Gul are accused of trying to topple the government with the publication last May of a video purporting to show Turkey's state intelligence agency helping to ferry weapons into Syria by truck in 2014.Their case has brought international condemnation and raised concerns about freedom of expression in Turkey. At their first hearing a week ago, the court took the case behind closed doors and accepted Erdogan as a complainant in what critics said was a move that undermined judicial independence."During the legal process, the president personally intervened, both as a complainant and through his repeated public statements. Turkey's judicial system is not strong enough to shrug off the dominance of this president," Muharrem Ozay, a lawyer for the two journalists, told Reuters.Erdogan has cast the newspaper's coverage as part of an attempt to undermine Turkey's global standing and has vowed that Dundar will "pay a heavy price".He has acknowledged that the trucks, which were stopped by gendarmerie and police officers en route to the Syrian border, belonged to the MIT intelligence agency and said they were carrying aid to Turkmens in Syria. Turkmen fighters are battling both Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and Islamic State.Ali Seker, one of more than a dozen opposition members of parliament outside the court room, said he and his colleagues were trying to exercise their legal right to observe the case and were concerned that Gul and Dundar might be re-arrested.The court on Friday rejected the opposition applications, lawyers said. Supporters chanted "You cannot silence the free press" and "Shoulder to shoulder against fascism".The two journalists spent 92 days in jail, almost half of it in solitary confinement, before the constitutional court ruled last month that pre-trial detention was unfounded because the charges stemmed from their journalism and they were released.Erdogan said he did not respect that ruling.INTERNATIONAL CONCERNThe trial comes as Turkey tries to deflect criticism from the European Union, United States and rights groups that say it is bridling a once-vibrant press.There were ugly scenes in Washington on Thursday, where Erdogan is on a visit, as his bodyguards tried to stop protesters chanting and waving banners outside the Brookings Institution think-tank where he was speaking."Turkey's leader and his security team are guests in the United States," said Thomas Burr, president of the National Press Club. "They have no right to lay their hands on reporters or protesters or anyone else for that matter ... Erdogan doesn't get to export such abuse."In his speech at Brookings, Erdogan warned he would continue to sue critics who insult him in Turkey, while in an interview with CNN, he denied being "at war" with the press."Espionage, do you think it is a freedom of expression or a freedom of press?" he told the broadcaster.Ahead of the trial, Dundar told Reuters he would use the hearings to refocus attention on the story that landed him in the dock, describing himself as a witness not a defendant.Erdogan has said prosecutors had no authority to order the MIT trucks be searched and that they were part of what he calls a "parallel state" run by his ally-turned-foe Fethullah Gulen, a U.S.-based Islamic cleric who the president says is bent on discrediting him and the Turkish government.The prosecutors have denied those allegations, while Gulen has denied plotting against the government.
Has anyone else tried Competetive matches, two teams of heroes vs each other with an environment deck thrown in for fun?We've been doing it (more for fun and testing than competition) for a bit and it works pretty well with only some minor changes.The opposing team is counted as non-heroes and Villain targets, your team is heroes for your cards. Hero cards that destroy ongoing are treated as destroying ongoing and equipment. A few cards have forced us to make some interesting rulings, but most work pretty well, while a few are just pretty worthless.Environment cards treat the teams as both heroes and villains, so if they hit only heroes, all heroes are targets, if they hit only villains, all heroes are targets.*For one player may discard. . . enviro effects, we alternated between highest to lowest to lowest to highest giving each player the choice, if you said no, you couldn't change your mind, the order of choice was up tothe lowest (whether to go first or last) it helps balance the play a bit more. Rook city was rough, some cards we had to change a bit to make it work.So far:2v2 Wraith and Fixer were sick, Smoke grenades, pipe wrench and driving Mantis made for some hard to damage heroes.Having Crono put bounties on you is disconcerting.The Scholar is annoying.3v3 got tedious and hard to manage with just two of us playing (though we did have tankier, more complex teams).If anyone else has been playing PVP style add your thoughts, if you haven't, give it a try. Then come add your thoughts.

Enjoy and vote for your favorites!Mistakes are the seeds of evolution and change. It is said that the journey of 1,000 miles begins with a single step. And it's within this single step that lessons are learned, directions are given, and mistakes have already been made a thousand times over. It is in fact this single step that provides us with an opportunity to learn from all those who came before us and to lay down the seeds of personal evolution and change. Learning from another's experience could be the most important factor towards achieving any kind of success in life. [details] (by Adam Sicinski) Be careful when comparing yourself to others. You know everything about yourself: your strengths, your weaknesses, your successes, and your failures. All you know about others is what they've chosen to show, and that would usually be only their success. List everything good about yourself and say, "Hey, I have a good personal résumé. Look at all I have achieved and what I can learn and achieve." You can then go out feeling good and prepared for whatever challenge the world presents for you. (by Colleen Dick) I am grateful for… To ensure that you do not take things for granted, begin a Gratitude Journal. Each day write on a blank piece of paper 'I am grateful for…' then write down as many things that you are grateful for. Believe me, you will realize how lucky you really are. Date each sheet, and when you aren't feeling all that crash hot, look back over what you have written and it will certainly boost your spirits! (by Viki Slough) Persist until it pays off.

Follow Jeff Add to circleTurbo lag is a defining characteristic of older forced-induction cars. These large turbochargers were used to feed high-performance engines and generate significant power. The problem would come when you called upon that power. Your right foot mashes the gas—then nothing. A shock of power would eventually make its way to the drive wheels, sometimes mid-corner. Turbo lag is notoriously finicky (and in the case of old race cars, a killer) and automakers have been working on ways to reduce or eliminate it. Volvo has its own solution and it involves a bit of engineering that we need explained.The system is called Power Pulse, and it works with the help of an air compressor and an electric motor. The motor waits for the driver to ask for more power, and it keeps the air compressor tank ready to go with clean air pulled in from the intake. When the throttle is pressed, the air tank can then force compressed air into the exhaust manifold and send it along with the exhaust gases to spool up the turbo.This is almost similar to what the Fast and Furious crew would be doing when they hit their "nitrous" button. They want to force more air into the engine, and here Volvo is forcing more air into the exhaust manifold to get the turbo up to speed more quickly. There's no need for bottles of NOS though, as the air compressor seems suited to handle the task.Once the turbo has spooled up, the air compressor's job is done. Now the electric motor refills the tank so the Power Pulse system is ready to help out the next time it's needed._______________________________________Follow Motor Authority on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.

Manchester City are yet to concede a goal in seven league gamesWomen's Super League One leaders Manchester City dropped their first points of the season after a frustrating stalemate at Liverpool.The hosts started well, Karen Bardsley saving from Caroline Weir and Shanice van de Sanden thwarted by Lucy Bronze.City then began to dominate, forcing Siobhan Chamberlain into saves from Toni Duggan and Bronze's fierce effort.Liverpool came closest to a goal 12 minutes from time, Rosie White heading a Laura Coombs corner onto the bar.The draw keeps City clear of Chelsea at the top heading into the mid-season break, while Liverpool are three points behind third-placed Birmingham.Liverpool captain Gemma Bonner: "City are a great side who are top of league and flying high."We know the quality they possess in the team but we also know that we've got it as well, so for us we wanted to play our own game, disrupt them and I think to keep a clean sheet tonight, we're delighted with that."For us it's definitely a step in the right direction, I'm really proud of the girls' efforts tonight."We've been scoring a lot of goals this season but I think for us it was a really disciplined performance - I think tactically we were brilliant and our defensive shape was superb."Manchester City midfielder Jennifer Beattie: "We're definitely disappointed not to get three points - with the run we've been on, we've been playing well, but unfortunately we just didn't match up to our standards today."A point is a point; we came in to get three - we've been on a good run and it's time to kick on for the next part of the season."We'll go onto the break, regroup and hope to get ourselves off to a winning start in the next half."It does feel like a loss, we've all said that after the game, but we'll look at it again, figure what went wrong and take it into the next game."

An anti-Muslim activist group, ACT for America, organized nationwide protests on June 10. The "March Against Sharia" was met by counter protesters across the country. (The Washington Post)AUSTIN — It had been billed as a "March Against Sharia" — one of many protests across the country against the feared subjugation, somehow, of Americans under Islam.But the few dozen sharia protesters who stood at the gates of the Texas statehouse didn't manage to march anywhere. They had failed to secure the permits for that.And as they shouted warnings against the supposed dangers of Muslim religious codes — which are practiced privately by a tiny fraction of the U.S. population — the demonstrators were drowned out by a much larger group of counterprotesters who mocked and harangued them for hours on Saturday.About 50 gathered at the Texas Capitol for an "anti-sharia law" rally, and around 300 came out to counterprotest. Riot police are out now. Posted by The Texas Observer on Saturday, June 10, 2017Like simultaneous events in other U.S. cities, the protest was organized by ACT for America — which claims to defend against a conspiracy of Muslim organizations and sympathizers trying to enforce sharia law within U.S. borders.But Austin organizer Lauren Morris insisted the event did not target Muslims, but merely religious laws derived from the Koran and traditions of the Islamic faith."It brutalizes them and robs them of their dignity, and it will not take hold in the West," she said.[Anti-sharia demonstrators hold rallies in cities across the country]In a somewhat confusing video advertising the Austin protest, Morris said she had been visited by Iranian students as a child. She described the horrors of female genital mutilation and said she had herself survived a "horrific cutting event."Morris was supposed to make a speech in Austin. But this didn't happen either, as counterprotesters shouted her group down for most of the event's four-hour duration.Instead, the anti-sharia protesters spent much of the day surrounded by a thick band of state police, separating them from a much larger crowd of detractors.Some of the counterprotesters were self-described "antifascists," who had mobilized to disrupt the event as soon as they heard about it.Others were simply people who came to say their piece.Inside the police line, a man held a sign: "I Don't Take Orders From Mohammed.""What's racist about any of this?" the man asked those screaming at him from the other side of the police line, as seen in video from the Texas Observer."Oh my God. Everything!" a woman replied.They yelled back and forth for a while. A woman with the anti-sharia group boasted of her rights to walk around without covering her head in the United States — unless she wanted to, which she did that day, with a "Make America Great Again" hat.A counterprotester listed the many evils and subjugations done in the course of American history."Do you know what the f— has happened on this land?" she yelled. "How the f— do you think your people got into power? F—ing genocide!""Hey, that was life back then, but we've moved on now," said the man with the "I Don't Take Orders From Mohammed" sign. "We don't do that anymore. But sharia does. Sharia does."A few blocks away, Austin Mayor Steve Adler held a sign: "Muslims are welcome in my town."An imam stood with the mayor, the Observer reported, and tried to assure anyone worried about sharia law being forced on the United States."Muslims have been following the Constitution since the days of the slave trade," the imam said.No violence or arrests were reported at the event, though some counterprotesters armed themselves with makeshift shields and clubs, occasionally setting off flares, and self-described "Oath Keepers" showed up to protect the anti-sharia protesters with rifles.Such was the scene in Austin, and it was not so different from the scene in dozens of cities across the United States on Saturday, as counterdemonstrators outnumbered the sharia foes almost 10 to 1.All of which thrilled the Council on American-Islamic Relations, which helped organize many of the national counterprotests."The anti-Islam rallies were a bust," said Ibrahim Hooper, the group's national communications director. "We've seen a tremendous rise in the level of anti-Muslim bigotry in our society — and against minorities of all kinds — but we've also seen a tremendous rise in support."Abigail Hauslohner and Justin Wm. Moyer contributed to

Google has wired its worldwide fleet of servers up with monitoring technology that inspects every task running on every machine, and eventually hopes to use this data to selectively throttle or even kill processes that cause disruptions for other tasks running on the same CPU.The search giant gave details on how it had developed the planet-spanning technology in a technical paper (PDF) due to be published next week – and its contents will be of major interest to anyone running massive Linux-based infrastructure clouds."Performance isolation is a key challenge in cloud computing. Unfortunately, Linux has few defenses against performance interference in shared resources such as processor caches and memory buses, so applications in a cloud can experience unpredictable performance caused by other program's behavior," the researchers write."Our solution, CPI2, uses cycles-per-instruction (CPI) data obtained by hardware performance counters to identify problems, select the likely perpetrators, and then optionally throttle them so that the victims can return to their expected behavior. It automatically learns normal and anomalous behaviors by aggregating data from multiple tasks in the same job."In essence, CPI2 lets Google engineers isolate poor performance down to a single task running on a single processor within a cluster of thousands, then drill down to it and select to throttle that task, without causing a CPU overhead of more than 0.1 per cent. It requires no special hardware and its only software dependency appears to be use of Linux.CPI2 lets Google gather information on the expected CPU cycles-per-instruction (CPI) of any particular task, build standard resource profiles from this data, and then use these profiles to help the web giant identify tasks that are taking more cycles-per-instruction than usual to get executed ("victims") and the tasks that may be causing this disruption ("antagonists"). Software agents can then throttle the antagonists so the victims stop fretting and get back to work (Sounds a bit rough–Ed).The "vast majority" of Google's machines run multiple tasks, the company wrote. These jobs are either latency-sensitive or batch-based, and are themselves typically composed of multiple tasks. 96 per cent of the tasks running on Google servers are part of a job with at least 10 tasks, and 87 per cent of the tasks are part of a job with 100 or more tasks.But these tasks can interfere with each other through foul-ups relating to processor caches and memory allocation problems, causing the latency of a task within an application to skyrocket – something that ad-slinger Google wants to avoid at all costs.To help it control latency spikes on each processor on a task-by-task basis, Google has rolled out CPI monitoring across all of its production servers. It derives its CPI data by measuring processor hardware counters, according to CPU_CLK_UNHALTED.REF divided by INSTRUCTIONS_RETIRED .Google gathers this data for a 10 second period once every minute via a perf_event tool in counting mode, rather than sampling mode. Total CPU overhead of the system is less than 0.1% and leads to no visible latency impact.Don't worry 'victim', the agents will save you!CPI is calculated to take account of variances in the type of CPU being run on, Google said, as typical clusters will run across a large range of platforms. CPI values are measured and analyzed locally by an agent that runs on every machine (pictured). This agent is always given the most current expected CPI distribution for the jobs it is running tasks for, so that it can spot aberrations without having to phone home.If this agent spots a "victim" task that is being slowed, it looks once per second for the "antagonist" tasks disrupting it. It uses an algorithm to do this that lets it work out whether there's a relationship between an antagonist's increasing use of CPU and a "victim" task spiking, in terms of the cycles needed per instruction.If it identifies an antagonist and finds that it is a batch job, then the system will "forcibly reduce the antagonist's CPU usage by applying CPU hard-capping".It is more than likely that this agent is given tasks from a component of Google's mega-infrastructure-management system named Omega, especially when you consider that the architect of Omega (computer science luminary John Wilkes) also happens to be one of the co-authors of the CPI2 paper.The CPI2 system can even automatically throttle disruptive tasks, but only if they have been marked as being eligible for what the search giant terms "hard-capping" – something that not many tasks are tagged as. Alternately, system operators can interface with CPI and can manually hard-cap suspects.CPI data is logged and stored offline, along with profiles of antagonist tasks, so admins can query it via Google's major internal analysis tool, Dremel (of which
You normally see the Roma woman with the colourful headscarf and a Costa coffee cup looking for change outside the Book Centre on John Roberts Square in Waterford.Then there's the middle- aged man who often sits at the back entrance to the City Square shopping centre. And sometimes there's the teenager near the Bank of Ireland on the quay with a cup in his hand. Yesterday they had disappeared.The city's small Roma community is living in fear, say its members, and are afraid to show their faces in public.Almost 200 people gathered in Waterford city last Saturday evening outside the home of a large Roma family – including toddlers and children – and staged a protest in which windows were smashed and doors broken down. Some Roma families had to be evacuated from their homes and are now living at undisclosed addresses.The following night a smaller group also protested and kicked at the doors of a building they believed housed members of the Roma community.It was the culmination of tension which has been building for some time – most of it whipped up over social media – over street begging and crime in the city. Numerous Facebook pages have appeared over recent months, labelling members of the Roma community as scum and threatening to "burn the cockroaches out". Most have since been taken down, only to be replaced with new pages.A counter-demonstration in the city last night, organised by Waterford Against Racism, called for calm and opposed any attempt to tackle local problems through vigilantism. About 100 people gathered on a drizzly night in John Roberts Square, against the backdrop of a heavy Garda presence."Yes ,there is crime in Waterford and yes, there is crime in the Roma community," Seamus O'Brien, a member of Waterford Against Racism, told the gathering. "But there's also crime in my family and yours. We can't allow ourselves to descend to mob rule and racist commentary on social media to solve this. We need to say 'no' to racism, and 'yes' to ending poverty."He said the Garda superintendent had told local politicians and representatives that the vast majority of crime in the city had nothing to do with the Roma community.'People are very, very scared'Stelian Ciuciu, of the Roma Integration Association, said many members of the community had little choice but to beg, and pleaded for greater understanding. "People are very, very scared . . . These are people who are not educated. They do not get social welfare, many of them. This is what they know. People need to understand this," he said.Few elected representatives from the major political parties were present at the gathering, although all parties have strongly criticised last weekend's trouble.Across the city in Manor Street, residents who agreed to be interviewed had mixed feelings over the local disturbances at the weekend.None defended the attacks on the local homes; and they claimed local criminal elements were involved in the intimidation of the Roma. But many felt issues involving crime and begging needed to be addressed by the Garda."I pride myself on not being a racist," said Bernard Cleary (39). "I try not to label people. But there are issues that need to be addressed. But the begging is an issue and I know people who've been victims of crime involving the community."Another man in his 60s – a former Waterford Crystal worker – said the begging was tarnishing the image of the city at a time when it was trying to attract tourists."A lot of people are sick of it. We're doing our best to attract these people. If it keeps up, they just won't come any more."The attacks at the weekend have also taken on a political edge, with some politicians privately blaming others of stoking up anger.Sinn Féin councillor John Hearne, who has taken a strong stance against crime in the city, has previously highlighted crime involving some foreign elements. But yesterday he insisted any targeting of the Roma community was reprehensible.Most in the city agreed the actions of just 200 people last weekend did not represent the view of the vast majority of the city's 50,000 residents."Begging is a problem," said local resident Dermot Keyes. "The problem here is we don't have enough gardaí to tackle street crime. Some Roma might be involved but by far and away the biggest crime problem we have is home-grown and involves people born and bred in the city."

Licensed trade operators in and around Glasgow have united to condemn the decision to stage a Celtic-Rangers ("Old Firm") match on Hogmanay, fearing it will make an already difficult night unmanageable and dangerous.Among the strongest comments have come from Paul Waterson, chief executive of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association, who wants the match moved to January 2 or 3 and away from the one night of the year when police are already at full stretch and the streets awash with revellers tanked up on supermarket drink carry-outs.Mr Waterson has also questioned why a recent attempt to stage a Munich-style Oktoberfest event in the city centre was knocked back – on the grounds that it would provoke drunken disorder – while an "Old Firm" clash has been sanctioned to go ahead.He said: "Does no-one remember Police Scotland's campaign last year during the festive season to reduce the number of domestic incidents – a time when violence is at its highest?"The SLTA has described the Hogmanay decision in forthright terms as "senseless" and "outrageous".Police were reportedly forced to despatch riot vans to control the chaos said to have erupted after an earlier attempt to stage the Oktoberfest event, which had no sectarian football connotation.A recent match between Rangers and Celtic sparked ugly scenes across Glasgow and into adjoining areas, with drunk supporters screaming sectarian abuse at each other throughout the afternoon.While attention is fixed on Glasgow, Hogmanay flashpoints could also surface in locations as different as Dumbarton and Kirkintilloch – much of west central Scotland could be involved.The poisonous historic sectarian rivalry between Rangers and Celtic is feared likely to take on an added edge to an already problematic night.Licensed trade expert Susan Young, editor of leading trade journal The Dram, said: "I haven't spoken to a single person who thinks this is a good idea. Hogmanay is supposed to be for families – that's the tradition – and instead we'll have something which has nothing to do with real celebration."She says that on a practical note it's also "the one night in the year" when many men help out, as in organising family parties – and predicts many football supporting spouses will be otherwise occupied.She also considers the licensed trade will struggle to contain the backlash from the game, whatever its result, and that even pubs closing early will face an extra security hazard as they strive to maintain their legal obligation by turning away aggressive drunks.A main worry is that many supporters will be both belligerent and drunk before trying to gain entry to licensed premises – dissuading normal Hogmanay revellers from having a drink "before the bells" .That in turn could give bars the worst of both worlds, with few regular customers braving late night streets for it to be worthwhile opening, and a deluge of drunk supporters to keep at bay.The propensity for domestic violence is feared set to rise dramatically.Another worry is that as embattled police try to contain "Old Firm" -related drunkenness, abuse and sometimes outright thuggery the chaos could leave the way open for opportunist criminals.Meanwhile Hogmanay, often said to have lost its traditional family and community spirit, could send out a message about Scotland wildly at odds with its supposed theme of inclusion, generosity and hope.A night when "auld acquaintance" is supposedly celebrated in a roseate familial and communitarian glow of Burnsian bonhomie could instead feature in January 1 news broadcasts as a squalid sectarian bacchanale which puts families at risk, mocking the "Glasgow Loves Hogmanay" theme which the city council hoped would move celebrations away from the usual Glasgow-style mass drunkenness.The police have said that planning for the unprecedented December 31 "Old Firm" fixture is already underway, and that policing it will involve "a multi-agency partnership approach".Assistant Chief Constable Bernard Higgins has defended the remarkable decision by maintaining that the time and date were decided after discussions involving police, football authorities and broadcasters.Chief Constable Phil Gormley said: "There is no ideal time to have the game, but if you put it on New Year's Eve at 12.30pm you reduce the risk of over-consumption of alcohol."You've also got a full transport infrastructure on so that people can get to and from the match."There's a compelling logic around it."

NEW DELHI: Here's something ayurveda gurus like Charak and Susrutha may not have imagined. Modern ayurvedacharayas, homoeopaths and other Ayush doctors may soon be allowed to conduct non-invasive abortions. The health ministry has worked out changes to the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Amendment Bill. The revised bill proposes to allow Ayush doctors to conduct non-invasive procedures on women seeking to terminate pregnancy. The draft bill will soon be sent to the Cabinet."We have made revisions to the earlier draft and proposed that Ayush doctors who are registered healthcare specialists be allowed to carry out non-invasive procedure, which would mean prescribing medicines etc," a senior health ministry official told TOI.Another key amendment seeks to increase the period for abortion to 24 weeks from the present 20 weeks. The government's proposal, originally formulated taking a cue from a study conducted by Population Council, is aimed at increasing access to safe abortion by expanding the number of healthcare providers. Estimates show around 7 million abortions are conducted in India every year and over 50% of them are said to be illegal.Initially, the government had decided to allow midwives and Ayush doctors to do even invasive procedures for abortion, but dropped it following mounting objections from allopathic practitioners, particularly Indian Medical Association (IMA) and Federation of Obstetric and Gynaecological Societies of India (FOGSI). IMA, a pan India voluntary organization with a membership of 2.5 lakh allopathic practitioners, said even the latest move can put patients at risk as well as allow unethical practices and sex selective abortions.TOIDon't Miss 40.7 K SHARES 16.5 K SHARES 9.9 K SHARES 9.4 K SHARES 3.9 K SHARES"MTP is a procedure meant to be conducted by an allopathic doctor only. It is not possible to allow restricted practice. How will the government monitor whether a person is conducting abortion through medicine or doing invasive procedures," says IMA secretary general Dr KK Aggarwal. According to Dr Aggarwal, abortions by a non-MBBS doctor can lead to critical medical conditions arising out of excessive bleeding or incomplete abortions, which can be difficult to handle.Ministry officials say FOGSI members were part of the consultations and initially supported the amendments. However, FOGSI has maintained that it changed its position after a thorough discussion. "Expanding the number and type of providers able to legally perform abortion services, including manual vacuum aspiration (MVA) and medical abortion (MA), could greatly expand women's access to safe abortion and save many lives each year," Population Council said in a note on the issue.The World Health Organisation (WHO) also seems to endorse the government's proposal. A technical and policy guidance for health systems by WHO released in 2012 states, "Abortion care can be safely provided by any properly trained health-care provider, including mid-level providers....(e.g. midwives, nurse practitioners, clinical officers, physician assistants, family welfare visitors, and others) who are trained to provide basic clinical procedures related to reproductive health..."TOITraditionally, mid-wives have played a key role in catering to urgent medical needs, especially attending to pregnant women for child delivery or even for abortion, in rural areas and villages that lacked medical facilities. Though with time government health centres and private players reached many such villages, mid-wives continue to exist and attend to many emergencies even today. The government's proposal to involve Ayush doctors has also found support from the women and child development ministry, National Commission for Women and other women's groups.(Originally published in The Times of India)
San Diego Harbor Police arrest a man after running across the Lindbergh Field airport runway Image credit: ABC NewsA Marine recruit possibly escaping boot camp was arrested after allegedly running across an open runway at busy San Diego International, stealing a van, then colliding with a tow vehicle.Just after 6 a.m. on Thursday, Harbor Police in San Diego received a call from Lindbergh Field Airport with reports of a fence alarm sounding off. Then a second report was made of what appeared to be "a Marine recruit running across the airfield toward the terminals," said Harbor PD Lt. John Forsythe.The airport is located next to the San Diego Marine Corps Depot near downtown. Two barbed-wire fences separate the depot from the airport's runways.Police say the man was seen running across a runway toward gate six in the Southwest terminal.Police went to the runway and found the man hiding inside a janitorial van that he had backed up, resulting in a collision with a Southwest airline tug-a small cart used to transport luggage. Police surrounded the van, ordered him out and handcuffed the marine. Cuts were found on the man's arms from jumping the barbed-wire fence.ABC News affiliate 10 News-KGTV said the suspect was taken to the Naval Medical Center San Diego, where he underwent medical and psychological evaluations.Police confirmed the man is a 22-year-old Marine Corps recruit from San Rafael, Calif. The recruit's name was not released.Police said they will charge the man with stealing a vehicle and trespassing onto the airfield. He is in the custody of the Marine Corps Police Department."The recruit reported to MCRD on Monday, January 14 and was going through initial processing," the San Diego Marine Recruit Depot said in a statement. "He had not begun recruit training."Forsythe believes the Marine recruit was trying to escape boot camp, saying "some recruits don't prepare for what they'll experience in boot camp."Forsythe says he's worked with Harbor police for 25 years and had seen recruits jumping the fence more often in the 1980's and '90s but said, "now a recruit jumping over the fence is a very rare occasion."
A pop-up art space has its grand opening party on Thursday night on International Avenue in Forest Lawn.Art Box on 17E will offer short-term, affordable artist studios and performance space for artists until at least Jan. 31, 2015.The facility at 1807 42nd Street S.E., formerly Mills Paint, was set up by the International Avenue Business Revitalization Zone and Calgary Arts Development Authority."The arts pop-up is a temporary fixture that we believe will put life into the site and help to drive the revitalization process by bringing the arts community to International Avenue," the BRZ said in a written release."It's a win-win situation, as the space will also bring arts and culture to the street, providing studios along with a space for established and emerging artists to display their artwork."
The family of Ibragim Todashev, an associate of alleged marathon bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev who was shot dead by an FBI agent, filed a wrongful-death claim today demanding $30 million.The 27-year-old Chechnyan national was killed by agent Aaron McFarlane in Todashev's Orlando, Florida, apartment on May 22, 2013. The agent, along with Massachusetts state troopers Joel Gagne and Curtis Cinelli, had been questioning Todashev about an unsolved triple murder in Waltham, Massachusetts, in which someone slit the throats of three drug dealers.The murder took place on the 10th anniversary of 9/11; the killers had lain their victims with heads turned to one side, and dumped a pound and a half of marijuana on two of the bodies, leaving $5,000 at the scene of the crime. The victims were Raphael Teken, Erik Weissman, and Tsarnaev's friend and sparring partner Brendan Mess. Tsarnaev, a Golden Gloves boxing champion, trained at the same gym with both Mess and Todahsev, an MMA fighter.Todashev was said to be midway through writing out a confession that implicated himself and the elder bombing suspect when something went wrong.According to the officers in the room, Todashev hit McFarlane on the head with a coffee table and then proceeded to charge Cinelli with a metal broomstick. Gagne was outside at the time, making calls to the Middlesex district attorney. McFarlane shot Todashev seven times in two bursts, including once in the top of the head and three times in the back. Todashev was allegedly on the ground preparing to lunge, when McFarlane shot the second time. Investigations conducted by the Department of Justice and Florida State Attorney Jeffery Ashton cleared McFarlane of any wrongdoing, arguing he shot in self-defense.Hassan Shibly, the director of the Florida chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, is filing the "notice of claim" on behalf of Todashev's family today. Under the Federal Torts Claims Act they must submit this document to the FBI before they can formally sue. In the claim they cite McFarlane's checkered past as a police officer in Oakland, California; the bureau's negligence in hiring him; and the undue pressure placed on Todashev as well as his friends and family after the marathon bombings.McFarlane was the subject of two police brutality lawsuits and four internal affairs investigations. He pleaded the fifth during one of the most high-profile trials against Oakland police when officers were charged with beating, kidnapping, and planting false evidence. The department settled out of court. McFarlane was still receiving a pension from the Oakland police department when he shot Todashev."The FBI was negligent in hiring McFarlane," lawyers acting for Todashev's parents argue in the claim. They also criticize the Department of Justice for not having a "disinterested investigator" question McFarlane about the shooting. The FBI has been scrutinized for their internal investigations, after a New York Times report found that the agency cleared every single agent in more than 150 investigations into shootings or deaths since 1993. McFarlane declined requests to be interviewed by the state attorney who conducted an independent investigation.Nowhere in the claim is it denied that Todashev attacked an agent; his parents say law enforcement officers breached a duty to keep their son safe by interviewing him in his home, and leaving him alone with only one agent and one officer in the room. According to Ashton's report, the agent, the troopers, and a Joint Terrorism Task Force officer, originally agreed to keep four members of law enforcement in the room at all times. They also argue that threatening Todashev's friends to become informants or face immigration problems caused him to act out and led him to "falsely confessing to crimes he did not commit.""I want justice first and foremost," Todashev's father, Abdul-Baki Todashev, told the Daily Beast from Moscow. "I never thought that things like this happen outside of the movies. I never realized law enforcement could ever do this, walk in and shoot somebody. I want to shine some light on this situation."Agents began to question Todashev about his relationship to Tsarnaev on April 21, 2013, shortly after the Tsarnaev brothers were identified as the suspects in the Boston Marathon attacks. Todashev's girlfriend, Tatiana Gruzdeva, and his friend Ashurmamad Miraliev, say they were asked to become FBI informants before they were detained and deported. Todashev's friend Khusen Taramov says that despite having a Green Card he was denied re-entry into the United States after Todashev's death.

Democratic presidential candidate, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., gestures towards Democratic presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton during the NBC, YouTube Democratic presidential debate at the Gaillard Center, Sunday, Jan. 17, 2016, in Charleston, S.C. (AP Photo/Mic Smith)In the battle over Wall Street regulatory bona fides, Hillary Clinton is often at a disadvantage. She has accepted donations from Wall Street donors, and Sanders has not.But at the Democratic debate in Charleston Sunday night, Clinton unearthed a part of Sanders' record on Wall Street regulations that seems -- at least at the outset -- to complicate his claim of being a crusader for more, rather than less regulation.Specifically, she noted that Sanders voted in favor of The Commodity Futures Modernization Act in 2000."Well, the last point on this is, Senator Sanders, you're the only one on this stage that voted to deregulate the financial market in 2000, to take the cops off the street, to use Governor O'Malley's phrase, to make the SEC and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission no longer able to regulate swaps and derivatives, which were one of the main cause of the collapse in '08," Clinton said.And she's right. But here's what she didn't say: Not only did President Bill Clinton sign that bill into law, but key officials in his administration were also credited with helping to craft it.The Sunlight Foundation, as part of their "Read the Bill" effort to demystify the legislative process explained it this way:Leading the charge in Congress were Sens. Phil Gramm (R-TX) and Richard Lugar (R-IN) and Rep. Thomas Ewing (R-IL). In May of 2000, Rep. Ewing introduced his Commodity Futures Modernization Act. While Ewing's bill sailed quickly through the House, it stalled in the Senate, as Sen. Gramm desired stricter deregulatory language be inserted into the bill. Gramm opposed any language that could provide the SEC or the CFTC with any hope of authority in regulating or oversight of financial derivatives and swaps. Gramm's opposition held the bill in limbo until Congress went into recess for the 2000 election. Throughout the better part of the year Gramm, Lugar and Ewing worked with the President's Working Group on Financial Markets—most specifically, Treasury Secretary [Larry] Summers, CFTC Chairman [William[ Rainer and SEC Chairman [Arthur] Levitt—to strike a deal on the bill.The final version of the bill included stronger deregulatory language, but it isn't clear whether many lawmakers knew that it was in there. (This was around the time that the country was embroiled in a contentious presidential vote recount in Florida.)The CFMA made its way through Congress on the back of a must-pass, 11,000-page bill to fund the government that year. This is where Sanders comes in, he joined a majority of Democrats and Republicans in approving the omnibus bill, which was signed into law by Bill Clinton.Bill Clinton has since said that he regrets that decision.
Opened two years ago in Neuschonau, Bavaria, in Germany, the tree-top walk is the longest of it's kind at 1300 meters that takes you to an impressive height of 25 meters above the tree tops. The walkway ends at an oval shaped dome, 44 meters high. The 360-degree spiral staircase around the dome offers breathtaking views of the surrounding nature. In clear weather you can even see the north ridge of the Alps. The tree-top walk is a part of the largest protected forest area in central Europe – Bavarian Forest National Park, which is also the first national park in Germany.The tree-top walk, Baumwipfelpfad in German, begins with a short elevator ride or stair climb to the ticket booth, a mere 8 meter above the parking lot. As hikers begin the leisurely walk down a 1300-meter long wood path, the ground begins to gently fall away -- or so it appears -- as the path inclines almost imperceptibly, making it easily accessible for parents with strollers. It is obvious the creators of the Baumwipfelpfad wanted to make visitors feel a part of the natural environment. The path advances freely through the forest, leaving the mature pines forever undisturbed.Several adventure stations are placed along the walkway including a narrow wooden plank enticing hardy trekkers to balance on the beam. These obstacles are fully-enclosed with a safety net and offers a rewarding view of the earth 50 feet below. The observation dome is shaped like a giant egg. Once at the top, a spectacular view awaits the visitors.Photo creditPhoto creditPhoto creditPhoto creditPhoto creditPhoto creditPhoto creditPhoto creditPhoto credit[via]

In a breather for Indian IT firms, the "discriminatory" USD 2,000 H-1B fee mostly imposed on them has now lapsed in a Republican-majority US Congress.The charges, often called outsourcing fee, had forced Indian IT companies in the last few years to pay millions of dollars towards protecting the US-Mexican border from illegal immigration.Indian firms had described the fee on highly-qualified IT professionals coming to the US on a H-1B visa as "discriminatory."The legislation with regard to a USD 2,000 fee on H-1B visas for companies having more than 50 per cent of its employees oversees was adopted by the US Congress in 2010 mainly at the instance of a group of lawmakers led by Senator Charles Schumer.Passed on August 10, the law contains provision to hike H-1B and L-1 Visa fee per application by USD 2,000 and USD 2,250 respectively for qualifying firm; which mainly targeted Indian IT companies.The duration of law was extended from four to five years under James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act of 2010 to provide healthcare and financial compensation for the firefighters and other 'First Responders' who helped out in the aftermath of the 9/11 attack.In a report released last month, NASSCOM said Indian tech industry contributed an estimated over USD 375 million during this period to the US Treasury including helping America secure its borders.In a recent interview, NASSCOM president R Chandrashekhar described the fee as unjustified. "It had nothing to do with the IT industry. It was applied in an inequitable way, which specifically targeted Indian companies," he said, adding that he would welcome any move to eliminate the fee.The Congress can still come up with a legislation to reinstall the discriminatory H-1B fee, which lapsed yesterday night, Congressional sources said.However, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE-USA) in a statement criticised the US Congress for the lapse of the H-1B fee.

Approximately 46 percent of single, uninsured young adults living in 34 of the states with a federal Obamacare marketplace will be able to purchase basic health coverage — a bare-bones "Bronze" level plan — for less than $50 per month after factoring in federal tax subsidies, according to a new report by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).An even greater number of young and uninsured single adults between the ages of 18 and 34 will be able to get coverage for less than $100 per month, according to government data. "Of [the 2.9 million] potentially Marketplace-eligible uninsured single young adults, approximately 1.9 million… may be able to pay $100 or less per month in 2014," wrote the report authors. That's nearly two-thirds of young adults who qualify for Obamacare marketplace coverage in the 34 states.An additional one million young adults will also now qualify for Medicaid coverage under Obamacare's expansion of the program. All told, the report finds that 40 percent of the 7.2 million young, uninsured adults living in the 34 states will be able to get coverage for $100 per month or less thanks to the health law. That works out to be 2.9 million people.If all of the 34 states had chosen to expand Medicaid, however, that number would actually spike to 6.2 million people. That's because many young adults earn little enough money to qualify for the program under Obamacare's Medicaid expansion.AdvertisementEarlier independent studies have found that families who qualify for Obamacare's subsidies will get an average annual credit of $5,548 per year to help pay for insurance under the law. That would cover a full 66 percent of these families' health premiums. A September report by HHS also found that 6.4 million Americans across all ages can get insurance through Obamacare's marketplaces for less than $100 per month.Those figures provide a contrast with recent reports that the health law is driving up individual policy premiums and even causing consumers to get cancellation notices from insurers. These stories tend to ignore the reality that many of these plans allure customers with deceptively low monthly premiums, but offer skimpy benefits, fail to cover out-of-pocket costs, and come loaded with high deductibles that are of little help in the case of a medical emergency. Obamacare marketplace plans must offer a wider variety of benefits, cannot deny people based on having a pre-existing medical condition, and limit cost-sharing depending on a person's income.
This is the third installment of Rachel Breton's column, "After the Whistle Blows," in which the Sky Blue FC player explores the issues, emotions and tough decisions that soccer players and all athletes face when they're forced to retire from the sport that shaped them.Birds learn how to fly, never knowing where flight will take them. -Mark NepoSinead Farrelly is one of the greatest players women's soccer has ever seen. When she plays, she reminds us of why we play. With every touch of the ball, she exudes joy and happiness. Farrelly is truly an unsung hero—staying humble, she doesn't say much, but her feet certainly do the talking.Yet last December, at the age of 27, due to injuries she sustained from a car crash, Farrelly announced she was giving up the sport that had brought her so much joy.The accident took place over a year earlier in September 2015. Farrelly was driving when another car came speeding around the corner, skidded into her lane and hit her straight on the driver's side. The head-on collision deployed both airbags and totaled Farrelly's car, forcing her to climb through the back of the vehicle to get out.[More from Excelle Sports: After the Whistle Blows: Learning to love life when you're forced to say goodbye to your sport]"The accident was crazy because, at the time, I had no idea of the impact it would have on my future and my life," Farrelly told me. "At the time of the accident, I declined treatment from the ambulance—I just wanted to go home. In all honesty, I kind of regret not taking help from the paramedics. My instinct has always been to just pretend to be OK. That's what we learn as athletes and professionals—to push through it. That pain is weakness. I was hurting and I was too proud to admit it."When she retired, Farrelly was on Seattle Reign FC's roster, although she had yet to play with the team. The year before, she had been on the Boston Breakers' roster but had sat out the 2016 season with neck and back injuries from the crash. Eight months later, she learned she had also suffered a concussion."All of a sudden, I just wasn't the person I had been for 25 years," she said of the effects of the concussion. "I felt so, so alone. Every moment was masked in this layer of fog that I could not seem to break through. I had no energy. I was depressed. I started distancing myself from everyone who loved me."Suddenly, Farrelly, who started playing soccer professionally for the Women's Professional League in 2011 after a decorated career at University of Virginia, found herself in a dark place."My time since the accident has been the most difficult time of my life," she said. "Aside from losing my health and career, I was forced to face all of my demons. When I tell you that every single thing from my past came crashing down on me, I mean every single thing: family issues, sexual assault, abuse, a long history of an eating disorder … All of it. I felt like I was facing the wreckage without any clue of who I was. I felt like I had absolutely nothing."The situation became unbearable and deeply overwhelming, especially immediately after the accident. Farrelly says she couldn't sleep or read, suffered terrible migraines and was even unable to walk or run. Facing what seemed like insurmountable challenges, she felt beyond hopeless in her own skin.[More from Excelle Sports: Sinead Farrelly retires from pro soccer, one year after car accident]"I did not want to live anymore. I would wake up in the morning so panicked because it felt too heavy to have to go through an entire day all over again," she said.The accident turned out to also be a catalyst for Farrelly to question her real identity. The sport had been her fulcrum up to that point. She struggled, as many players do, to reconcile who she would be without soccer. Last December, she announced her retirement on Facebook."Soccer was my outlet when times were hard," Farrelly wrote on her page of the decision. "It was a place I felt safe, yet it continued to push me past my comfort zone day after day. Losing soccer for me was losing my identity. And with the loss of that came the loss of everything."While Farrelly tried to come back to soccer, she knew she had to listen to her body. She knew she needed to rest, recover from her injuries and from her post-concussion symptoms."I had no desire to retire any time soon," she said. "It still makes me really sad I had to go out the way I did.
(MOSCOW) — U.S. President Donald Trump has "lit the wick of war" with North Korea and his country will be made to pay with "a hail of fire," a Russian news agency quoted North Korea's foreign minister as saying on Wednesday.Tensions between North Korea and the United States have risen in recent weeks over Pyongyang's nuclear weapons and missile programs.North Korea has test-fired several missiles and conducted what it said was a test explosion of a hydrogen bomb as it advances toward its goal of developing a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland.Speaking to Russia's state-run TASS news agency, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his country's nuclear program guaranteed peace and safety in the region and would not be a matter of discussion."With his bellicose and insane statement at the United Nations, Trump, you can say, has lit the wick of a war against us," TASS quoted Ri as saying. "We need to settle the final score, only with a hail of fire, not words."Ri has previously called Trump "President Evil" and his comments are likely to fuel an escalating war of words between the U.S. President and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un."We have almost reached the last point on the journey towards our final goal – to achieve a real balance of power with the United States," he said."Our principal position is that we will never agree to any talks in which our nuclear weapons will be the subject of negotiations."
Yes, I've written an imaginary PR e-mail from Edwina Rogers, the controversial new Executive Director of the Secular Coalition for America, based on conjectures and false hopes and a little bit of AbFab. It seemed the thing to do."I want to start off with an apology for something I feel like I, and the SCA, have done a poor job of. We've done a poor job of introducing me and an incredibly poor job of reaching out to opinion leaders in the atheist movement. Undoubtedly, the behind-closed-doors decision to make what was bound to be a controversial hiring decision should have been tempered by a more comprehensive and immediate introduction and explanation of why I, of all people, was chosen for this position.I have identified as a non-theist for a long time, but I am very new to this movement. This is not because I don't care about the issues you care about, I very much do, but they have not been my focus and, because of that, I really didn't realize how bad things were until recently. My career and my focus have been very issue centered, some of these issues overlapped with my own secular beliefs, but the fact is that issue-focused work tends to create a very insular worldview. So, in many ways, I am a recent convert, not to your beliefs, but to your cause.Which is where I have made another mistake. This community is very engaged and very well-informed and I have done my best to educate myself quickly, but there are things I have missed on the way. My recollection of statistics about Republicans from 20 years ago, for example, is not really the best gauge of Republicans now. Sometimes I forget that that was an entire generation ago, it doesn't seem that long to me. And I have to admit that my claims that the majority of Republicans are pro-choice, OK with gay rights, and for the separation of church and state were as much a result of wishful thinking as they were of ignorance. I have had statistics shown to me that do indeed prove I was dead wrong on this front.And I need your help on this front. I am trying, but I just am not as well-educated about this as those people who have focused on this cause their whole lives. I know the goals of the coalition and am well-versed in those goals and don't doubt my ability to execute them, but as for the wider culture of the secular movement and the less specific goals thereof, I will need more time to learn the nuances, and I hope you will help me rather than condemning me for my neophyte status.My final big mistake is that I've been trying to focus exclusively on my positives without acknowledging my negatives and without engaging with them openly and honestly. This is a fault of being in politics, it makes you quite the bullshit artist. I should have known better in this community than to think I could dance around questions without being called on it. So let me say that you are right. You are right that I've worked for and support a party that disagrees, in majority but not in totality, with many of your goals. But I was working for causes that I cared very deeply about, and I will not apologize for doing that. And I will not abandon my party because other people have taken it in a direction I disagree with. It is better for all of us if we can bring the party back in line with the goals of the secular community and I really do think that is possible.So, just to recap, I haven't done a good enough job introducing myself, I haven't had the time to educate myself as thoroughly as the community is educated, and I have not been clear on acknowledging that there were some negatives to my background. That said, I think I bring a lot to the table that I hope you can appreciate.I am an experienced lobbyist and I know the workings of DC very well. I have led coalitions in the past and had great success. Although my work with Republicans is difficult for many of you to accept, it gives me an in to people who might not otherwise be as interested in hearing what we have to say. And I am legitimately, passionately interested in promoting this cause. I did not simply apply because I needed a job — I had a job, one that was a lot less contentious — I applied because I have become aware of some of the horrible inequities in this country for people who are secular. I am just as horrified as all of you at the degree of influence the Christian Right has on the government, and I want to change that. I have the credentials to do the job from a strictly political side, but I promise you that I am here because I want to be, because this cause is important to me, and because I think that I personally can make a difference through this position with the SCA.The SCA chose me because I was, in
Guinea midfielder Naby Keita joined German Bundesliga side RB Leipzig in June 2016RB Leipzig's coach Ralph Hasenhuettl said they are investigating why Guinea midfielder Naby Keita collapsed in the dressing room area following a Bundesliga game on Saturday.Having played the 90 minutes of Leipzig's 1-0 defeat to Wolfsburg, 22-year-old Keita lost consciousness shortly after leaving the dressing room and was taken to hospital once his condition stabilised.On Sunday, the club said his test results are in order and he may have suffered a circulatory collapse brought on by exertion but they want to find out the exact cause."He spent the night in hospital and he's feeling better. All the test results are okay," said Hasenhuettl."It seemed to be the fault of his circulation, he burnt himself out yesterday (during the game)."For sure, we will continue to look for causes in the next few days."It was probably a combination of several factors. I am glad that there is no deeper disorder. His test results were all okay, that is why we have to look at what was the cause."
Analysis of Cincinnati shooting's aftermath reveals how multiple officers discussed claim – disputed as the basis of a murder charge – that Ray Tensing was 'dragged' by unarmed black man's carUniversity police officer charged with murder for shooting of Samuel DuBose Read morePolice officers in Cincinnati appear to have corroborated a false account of the fatal shooting of Samuel DuBose in the immediate aftermath of the incident, a detailed analysis of body-camera video released on Wednesday shows.DuBose, an unarmed 43-year-old black man, was shot dead by white University of Cincinnati police officer Ray Tensing on 19 July. The officer claimed he was "dragged" by DuBose's vehicle following an altercation during a routine traffic stop, and was therefore forced to open fire, shooting DuBose once in the head.On Wednesday, Tensing was indicted for murder after Hamilton County prosecutor Joseph Deters said body-camera footage, which he released at a press conference announcing the charge, showed the officer was not dragged during the encounter."It is our belief that he was not dragged. If you slow down this tape you see what happens, it is a very short period of time from when the car starts rolling to when a gun is out and he's shot in the head," Deters told reporters on Wednesday.'Senseless' and 'asinine': prosecutor's words on Samuel DuBose killing a win for reformers Read moreThe footage shows that Tensing falls back, after DuBose is killed instantly by a single shot to the head and immediately chases after the vehicle. Deters said that DuBose's limp body probably caused the car to accelerate.A Guardian analysis of the nearly 28 minutes' worth of Tensing's body-camera footage released by the prosecutor's office also shows the aftermath of the shooting and reveals that on three occasions, two other police officers repeat Tensing's account that he was dragged by DuBose, and one of these officers claims to have witnessed it occurring.Tensing repeats, multiple times throughout the footage, the claim that he was dragged by DuBose's vehicle. But at five minutes and 44 seconds into the video, he states: "I think I'm OK. He was just dragging me."To which a second officer, who stands out of the frame, replies: "Yeah, I saw that."Tensing continues: "I thought I was going to get run over. I was trying to stop him."Then, at six minutes and 54 seconds into the footage, while Tensing is seemingly conversing with the same officer, he states: "He was dragging me, man."The officer replies, "Yeah." To which Tensing continues: "I got my hand and my arm caught inside." The officer then replies, "Yeah, I saw that."The identity of this officer is not immediately clear. A copy of the University of Cincinnati police division's information report on the shooting names university police officer Phillip Kidd as a witness to the entire event.The information report, written by UC police officer Eric Weibel, states: "Officer Kidd told me that he witnessed the Honda Accord [DuBose's vehicle] drag Officer Tensing, and that he witnessed Officer Tensing fire a single shot."Weibel's report continues: "Looking at Officer Tensing's uniform, I could see that the back of his pants and shirt looked as if it had been dragged over a rough surface."About 14 minutes into the video, while Tensing is still at the site of the shooting, but has now moved further away from DuBose's crashed car, he is instructed by a third officer to indicate where the altercation had started.Facebook Twitter Pinterest Prosecutor announces charges against officer for Samuel DuBose shooting. WARNING: contains footage of the fatal incident. Link to videoThis officer appears to be a member of the Cincinnati police department and wears a sergeant's lapel on his arm. He states: "You can talk about anything you want except for what happened [sic]. The only thing that I ask of you is where did it start?"Tensing replies: "I initiated the traffic stop at Vine and Thill."The two officers then clarify the direction Tensing was driving. The sergeant then states: "And, it looks like you got dragged if I'm understanding, looking …"To which Tensing replies: "Yes."The Hamilton County prosecutor's office did not reply to a question from the Guardian after Deter's press conference over whether any other officers were being investigated in relation to the incident.A representative for the UC police referred all questions to the prosecutor's office. The Cincinnati police department did not respond to a request for comment.At a rally in Cincinnati on Wednesday night organized by Black Lives Matter, protester James Yaacov Delaney said he thought

"The actions of the U.S. warship have threatened China's sovereignty and security interests, jeopardized the safety of personnel and facilities on the reefs, and damaged regional peace and stability," China's Foreign Ministry said in a statement on its website after the destroyer USS Lassen sailed close to the Subi Reef in the Spratly Islands.The "U.S. side [should] think twice, not ... take rash moves and stir up troubles," China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi warned in a separate statement.A U.S. defense official said the mission was part of an ongoing global effort to keep international waters open for navigation in the face of "excessive maritime claims." The official denied the U.S. was specifically targeting China.China says virtually all of the South China Sea belongs to it. Beijing's claims over the group of at least a half dozen dredged islands, one of which includes a recently completed two-mile airstrip, have angered the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei, and Taiwan, which have overlapping claims in the waters.Related: China Builds Runway on Reef in Disputed Sea: PentagonThe Spratlys sit in an area potentially rich in oil and gas reserves.Along with other island chains in the South China Seas, Beijing claims the Spratlys as part of China's territory and argues that international law grants them a 12-mile exclusion zone. While the U.S. officially does not take sides in the dispute, it also does not recognize the exclusion zone."We have been clear that we take no position on competing territorial sovereignty claims to land features in the South China Sea," a Pentagon official told NBC News on Monday night.
Yes, this is a cute little 5" TFT display with WVGA 800x480 resolution and it has a resistive touchscreen overlay. And yes it comes with an equally cute little driver board and USB-enabled 40-pin to 50-pin touchscreen adapter board.We tried to get the smallest display that would be good for embedded computing usage and at a good price. We also chose our favorite 5" touchscreen then paired it with a small USB powered driver board through our 50pin to 40pin + AR1100 Adapter. The screen itself is commonly seen in consumer electronics such as miniature TVs, GPSs, handheld games, car displays, etc. It comes with a 40-pin connector that has eight red, eight green, and eight blue parallel pins for 24-bit color capability.The driver board only has an HDMI input but for Raspberry Pi, BeagleBone Black and other computers. HDMI is the best quality output available so you'll get a great looking display. The display is very easy to use - simply connect the USB power cable to 5V power supply that can provide 500mA, then connect a digital video source to one of the HDMI port. Voila, a display! To demonstrate it, we took some photos with the display connected to a Raspberry Pi, but it will also work connected to any device with HDMI output. We also noted it does not work with a Raspberry Pi + Windows 10 IOT yet.The touchscreen controller shows up as a plain 'HID Mouse' device - and we do the touch screen calibration step here so you can plug and play. Works with any computer, just plug a mini B cable from the touch adapter to the computer USB port. If you want to calibrate it again, Microchip has Windows-only calibration software. For Linux users, check out xinput_calibrator which is the general-use X11 calibration software.There's a little wired PCB with little buttons that let you enter a menu system for adjusting brightness, color and contrast. It tries to auto-detect which input you have and switches to that one or you can 'select' from the menu keypad which to display.For use with a Raspberry Pi we suggest editing config.txt to set the HDMI to 800x480 in case it doesn't detect the resolution properly. You can see our suggested config.txt in the Technical details tab. The easiest way to edit the config.txt is to put the Pi SD card into an every day computer and edit config.txt with any text editor and save. For use with a Beagle Bone Black, we found it works when plugged in, no configuration required.We show the TFT above on a wire stand, which is not included. You can pick up one of these nice stands over here.A power adapter is not included or required! Use a 500mA-capable 5V USB port or you can cut the USB power cable and re-wire to another 5V source. You'll also need a MiniB cable to connect to the touchscreen sensor.
The real action is in the competition for second place in the Republican field, where CNN and RCP both have Rubio's support at 15 percent; all of the CNN polling and most of the RCP polling, though, was conducted before Rubio's already-infamous performance in Saturday night's debate. John Kasich, who seemed to do well in the debate and has picked up a number of New Hampshire endorsements, is in third in the FiveThirtyEight projections and in fourth, narrowly behind Ted Cruz's 13 percent, in both the CNN and RCP numbers.
Save their lives, or build a border wall?Donald Trump would like for the United States to spend $1.1 billion less on HIV-treatment programs in sub-Saharan Africa, and $524 million less on contraception for the global poor.On the plus side, these cuts will make it easier to finance the president's border wall, which he hopes to spend $1.6 billion on in 2018.On the downside:At least one million people will die in sub-Saharan Africa and elsewhere, researchers and advocates said on Tuesday, if funding cuts proposed by the Trump administration to global public health programs are enacted.… With a huge share of Africa's population reaching sexual maturity in the next four years, the virus could again imperil much of the continent if fewer people are treated, said Brian Honermann, deputy director at amfAR, a foundation that invests in AIDS research.AIDS treatment not only keeps people alive but prevents them from spreading the virus to others, Mr. Honermann noted. "If you cut the funding by this much, I think there's a real risk we will backslide, and a whole lot more people will become infected," he said.These cuts almost certainly won't happen. The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (Pepfar) — America's primary program for funding HIV treatment — is one of George W. Bush's (only) signature achievements, and enjoys strong, bipartisan support.So, it's tempting to dismiss these eye-popping death-toll estimates as irrelevant — ultimately, the Trump budget is just Mick Mulvaney's (sloppily executed) math homework, not an actual governing document.But such nonchalance is wrongheaded. And not only because Trump's budget functions as an expression of his (monstrous) values.The president may be unlikely to cut $1 billion from AIDS treatment, but his budget makes it clear that he will not be adding any more money to such programs. And that latter fact is about as morally objectionable as the first.The Global Fund estimates that every $100 million invested in HIV treatment saves about 133,000 lives. Currently, the United States — the wealthiest country in human history — spends $6 billion annually on AIDS programs. The Pentagon recently spent $125 billion on (what its own internal study deemed) "administrative waste."Our nation could easily afford to save hundreds of thousands more people from preventable deaths. When we choose instead to cut taxes for the rich — and/or spend $1 trillion on the F-35 — we are choosing to let them die.
Imagine if you could plug an external graphics card into your MacBook, then use it for for virtual reality or other gaming. You'd never need a dedicated gaming computer again.That's the dream behind The Wolfe, an external graphics card for the Mac that hits Kickstarter tomorrow. Two versions of this Thunderbolt accessory, The Wolfe and The Wolfe Pro, offer an Nvidia GTX 950 and GTX 970 respectively.The card fits into a case that's a 7.8 inches deep by 5.4 inches wide and 2.6 inches tall, which weighs between two and 3.2 pounds. Stick this in your bag with your laptop, the theory goes, and you've got a portable gaming MacBook.Related: No Rift support for Mac until 'Apple releases a good computer,' says Oculus founderMacs, shall we say, do not have the best reputation among gamers. Apple builds its laptops with portability and battery life in mind, not graphical performance. And in general, laptops built specifically for gaming tend to be heavy with awful battery life.The Wolfe could offer a third path, if it works well. It gives you graphics when you need it, but leaves the MacBook highly portable the rest of the time. Road To VR is reporting that the Wolfe is compatible with the following laptops:MacBook Air 11-inch, Mid 2011–2015MacBook Air 13-inch, Mid 2011–2015MacBook Pro Retina, 13-inch, Late 2012–2015MacBook Pro Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2012–2015MacBook Pro 13-inch, Early 2011–2015MacBook Pro 15-inch, Early 2011–2015Mac mini, Mid 2011–2015iMac, Mid 2011–2015Mac Pro, Late 2013-2015Indeed, VR is part of the product pitch. The website for The Wolfe shows a user using Oculus Rift alongside a MacBook. Since Oculus doesn't support Mac officially, we believe it is only possible if the laptop is boot into Windows using Bootcamp. No official word has been given as to how the Rift compatibility would be enabled.It's not clear what The Wolfe and Wolfe Pro will cost, but we can read the tea leaves. The Nvidia GTX 950 costs around $160, and the GTX 970 costs around $250. We'd expect The Wolfe to mark those costs up considerably. We'll get more details tomorrow, when The Wolfe pops up on Kickstarter. Stay tuned.
A little about meMy name is Jen or "Jennifer" if I piss my parents off enough. I am born and raised in Ontario, Canada and no, you don't get used to the winters, at least I haven't yet in my thirty something winters here!I have always had a magnetic pull towards creative endeavors. My earliest activities were drawing, sculpting (horrendously) and painting whatever I could. At the age of 6 or 7 I decided that my father was completely wasting his tool shed with such nonsense as lawnmowers and gardening tools, and took it upon myself to take over and make it my painting studio.Let me tell you, it was hot as hell in that little wooden shed at the back of our yard, but I was determined to make my art and my dad didn't complain, in fact he was my very first customer, and still has the misshapen, heat stroke induced portrait of our family dog somewhere.I went to school for photography, and while that is still a major passion and hobby for me, I quickly realized that I didn't have the drive or will to deal with the horrors of wedding photography and the like, and that my resting bitch face wasn't helping the situation any.I spent a lot of years making my art for friends and family, or mostly just for my own amusement. I toyed with the idea of selling on Etsy for YEARS. Once I began to create things for my shop I found that I could not stop. The ideas are streaming in almost constantly and I have since branched out into soaps, bath products etc, which was a whole new art form for me and something that I am finding to be immensely satisfying. Soap making is like art and science rolled into one and the possibility for creation is endless!Another passion I picked up in the last couple years has been Pyrography or "wood burning" and it quickly became not only an obsession, but the most sought after art I have ever created!I have no doubt in my mind that creating and expanding my artistic horizons will only continue on and on, thus my little shop has become something of a "general store" featuring plenty of different items and products, and as much as online advice tells us to stick to one item per store, this works for me and I love the variety!I hope you will enjoy scrolling through and will come back often if only to see what this mad girls mind has concocted next!Cheers,Jen
Rep. Robert Hurt Robert HurtDemocrat defeats controversial chair of House Wall Street subpanel Republican groups launch final ad blitz in key House battlegrounds Armed protester stands outside Dem's office for 12 hours MORE (R-Va.) will retire at the end of next year, according to multiple reports.Hurt first won election in 2010 to represent the central Virginia district, when he unseated the incumbent Democrat Tom Perriello.Two Democrats have already declared candidacies for the seat: Former Perriello aide Ericke Cage and Albemarle County Supervisor Jane Dittmar.ADVERTISEMENTThe seat will likely remain in the GOP column despite Hurt's retirement. Mitt Romney won the district by 7 points in 2012 over President Obama.Hurt is the second House Republican to announce his decision not to seek reelection after Congress adjourned for the holidays. Centrist Rep. Richard Hanna (R-N.Y.) announced over the weekend he will retire in 2016, which may offer Democrats a pick-up opportunity.

Thanks for the Feedback here and on Reddit – a few updates below:Anytime Star Trek Online introduces an entirely new set of STF's (Special Task Force), there is a period of adjustment that the community goes through to absorb the new mechanics and establish teamwork to overcome the new challenges. Sometimes they are relatively easy and reward well enough that they become popular. Other times it takes significant effort and planning just to get through an STF, and those queues get ignored by most of the community.One thing is for sure, a queues popularity will change over time, as do the techniques used to get through them. The best example is "I've got Kang!" has evolved from being a job you took out of necessity, to something that's little more than a speedbump in the race to complete a CSA in under 30 seconds.The new missions have their fair share of confusion at the moment that's impacting not only the normals but advanced and elite queues as well. I've had greater success with runs set up privately through Redditchat or the various DPS channels – but at the same time, I've also watched Elites fail in the first 30 seconds with a highly-skilled team, just because someone pushed a Battleship to close to the Starbase with a mistimed tractor beam repulsor.One last point before the briefing: these techniques represent the efforts of many players, and while they worked for us, they may not be the only way to beat this STF. If you've come across other methods, don't hesitate to share them in the comments below.Mission Brief: The Tzenkethi FrontRegardless of the difficulty (normal, advanced and elite), the mission parameters remain essentially the same. A Tzenkethi invasion force has moved five small staging bases into the Eta Serpentis system, and are launching waves of attacks against the planet's defences (Klingon Starbase).Your goal is to intercept the Tzenkethi Battleships – marked by the Protomatter Bomb warning sign on your main viewscreen. In the process of destroying the battleship, you recover the Protomatter Bomb and then use it against one of the five Tzenkethi staging bases.The STF comes with voice prompts and reminders, letting you know when a player has picked up the bomb, and when a base is destroyed. When you pick up the bomb, your ship will be given a visual cue identifying that you have the bomb. If you are destroyed, the protomatter bomb you carry is destroyed with you.The Football (Protomatter Bomb)While in Tzenkethi hands, the protomatter bombs are targeted at your station. They can be deployed fairly close to the station, and the bomb itself cannot be intercepted by weapons or space magic. At about a 2km range, a Battleship can easily deploy the device and hit your station. (It's instantaneous) For Normal and Advanced runs, the optional objective is to prevent damage to the station for additional marks. For Elite runs, failure to stop this attack on your station is an auto failure.When the football is in a players hands, your ship becomes impacted by the bizarre effects of protomatter. The first thing you will notice is that your ship is unable to go to full impulse, and you appear to be covered in a type of exotic radiation. This becomes problematic as you try to get to the Tzenkethi bases quickly.Warning: If you use a teleport ability like Trajector Jump you will drop the bomb and a Tzenkethi group will immediately warp in and claim the bomb. (TY ElectrumLeopard)Additionally – if you carry the bomb with a Romulan ship, do not use the singularity jump or you will lose the bomb; same thing with the singularity shadows. (TY Nandos)Some players will experience a visual glitch in that the bomb may appear to 'drop' along the way. This appears to be a coding problem in the game, or if you prefer, a false image caused by temporal distortion (a QA happy accident). As long as you have the main marker showing you have the bomb, it will not release until you are in range when you are offered an interaction button to drop the bomb. Deploying the bomb takes a short amount of time, and if you're taking damage, the bomb will not drop. A second visual glitch appears to happen when you switch alts and make multiple runs – occasionally the bomb identification will not show. There is no easy fix other than restarting the game after you complete the mission.The TzenkethiThe Tzenkethi battle groups operate in waves. You will encounter groups of frigates on an ongoing basis, while the bomb groups consisting of a battleship, and a cruiser to provide support. The higher the difficulty,

Spotting that a certain other cycling publication has provided tips on how to make your commute more like the Tour de France, we threw a few ideas round road.cc towers regarding what else you might want to consider. Here's what we came up with.Make your commute more like the Tour de France by ...... taking a 2,000-mile, circuitous route to the office (starting abroad every two or three days)... only riding to work for three weeks each July, but cycling to the office at weekends and leaving the bike at home for the second and third Mondays... having a friend drive a van ahead of you while chucking sweets and cheap keyrings at passers-by... getting Chris Boardman to do a Periscope pointing out key features of the route such as potholes, badly parked cars and woeful infrastructure... riding with eight pals and 190 other people, with mates and spouses following you in their cars... waiting at the traffic lights just after you've punctured and grabbing the bike from the next cyclist who stops there... throwing your jacket into the open window of a car once the rain's stopped... watching a Wiggle advert at every traffic light... pulling up at the side of the road if you're caught short and whipping it out from under your bibshorts while balancing the bike between your thighs... bouncing off a car, losing loads of skin and carrying on to the office anyway rather than going to A&E like a normal person... belting into Parliament Square at top speed, whacking mobiles out of the hands of Big Ben selfie-taking tourists as you go... asking passers-by to spit on you and throw piss in your face (granted, this may be more like a normal commute in some areas)... passing an old lady on a sit up and beg before you crest Cambridge's Hills Road railway bridge, then changing into a polka dot jersey when you get to work... shepherding a colleague along the route then leaving them for dead once the office comes into sight, thereby avoiding the need to ever talk to them again (though your partners may have words)... standing on a step and objectifying two female colleagues when you arrive, then taking a cuddly toy to your desk... retreating into your cubicle in a sulk after a tough ride to work and chucking your helmet at any colleague who approaches... undergoing a blood transfusion by the photocopier... having all your commutes from a seven-year period deleted from Strava and replaced by a blank space and an asterisk... watching highlights of it at 11.30pm every night, commentated on by two blokes who know bugger all about cycle commuting but can point out interesting buildings en route.Do you have any more tips to add to the list? Let us know in the comments below. Thanks to Cycling Weekly for the inspiration.
PhotoDaniel Grayson is the associate director of undergraduate admissions at Tufts University in Medford, Mass.The task, as colleges and universities around the country have assigned it, is to describe yourself in 500 words or less. Sum up all of who you are — your aspirations, perspective, strengths, intellect, personality, all of it — in one page, single spaced.Hit the panic button.You know what I do when faced with a problem? I ask the Internet. So do a Google search — I dare you — for the phrase "admissions essay advice" and see the mess you get.One list on a prominent Web site includes the following suggestions (in order, with some paraphrasing): be cautious and then, immediately afterward, be controversial.O.K. Got it: Say something risky without taking chances. That's not helpful.Neither is the advice you get from most admissions officers when you ask them."Just be yourself," they say. Is there an alternative to that? Were you supposed to lie and pretend to be your smarter and more interesting older brother?Here are your deceptively complicated essay goals, as I see them:Show us how you think.Tell us what matters to you.I'm not going to sugarcoat this: That is a really difficult task. It demands that you understand yourself in a way that perhaps no one has ever asked of you. It demands that you ask yourself questions perhaps no teacher has ever asked. Questions like:What invigorates/inspires/angers me?What do I wish we talked or learned about in school?What are my most strongly held opinions and where do they come from?What are the differences between how I see myself and how others see me?What pieces of my life transform my thinking (whether I want them to or not)?What ideas fire me up just when everyone else is cooling down?These aren't easy questions. They are dangerous questions. They are questions with teeth, questions that require you to stake out a position, to have an opinion and to express something of substance.You don't need to literally answer one of those questions to write a good admissions essay (though you could); think of the list as a set of examples.Being honest and forceful about yourself may make some adults around you nervous; it's not "safe." They will worry that you are being too controversial or informal. You should listen carefully and try to see your writing from their perspective. But you should feel comfortable ignoring advice that does not feel right.If you are not interested in thinking about the big issues (or the small ones) around community service, here is some radical advice: Don't write about it.If you love your sport, but it isn't what you are itching to talk about when you get out of bed, don't write about it.Writing about service or determination reflects important qualities, but no one in our applicant pools writes about how quickly they quit or how much they hate helping society. If you write the "safe" essay, how will you stand apart?I wrote of your goals, now here is ours: to build the most interesting and intellectually diverse class we can. We want to fill our seats with students who have things to say, who will challenge conventions and advance conversations, who will learn from each other.The answers to those dangerous questions define who you are. They reflect what you value and how you think, as well as how you will enhance our community and classrooms. You need to be confident and proud enough to stand behind those ideas because if you won't, why would an admissions officer choose to stand behind you?As a reader, I want to be in your corner, to fight for your cause in a hypercompetitive applicant pool. Can you fit all of who you are into 500 words? Of course not, but you can pick out a couple of important pieces.Tell me what matters, and give me a reason to fight.
Honda's first tiller, the F150 launched in 1959, was distinguished by a bright red body.Unfortunately there is no surviving documentation to indicate who chose the distinctive color for the product.Interestingly, the Cub F Type auxiliary bicycle engine, a compact and lightweight reliable motor with a striking design that was released in 1952, was marketed as "the red engine with a white fuel tank," suggesting that the choice of red was already popular with consumers. Honda had firmly established itself as the company that made red engines.At one point Soichiro gathered his agricultural machinery engineers together and said, "There are plenty of products other than motorcycles that people would find useful. So I want you to think of ways that we can use science and technology to reduce heavy labor in the farming and fishing industries in particular."The result was the F150 tiller, painted in the distinctive red color referred to in-house as R2. With its many user-friendly innovations, the F150 proved to be a massive hit product in what was a relatively crowded market segment. And from then on, Honda tillers have always been red.

WASHINGTON ― The Jones Act waiver for Puerto Rico expired Sunday night, and "it is not being extended at this time," Department of Homeland Security spokesman David Lapan told HuffPost on Monday.DHS had temporarily waived the Jones Act ― an arguably outdated law that imposes exorbitant shipping costs on the U.S. island ― on Sept. 28. The waiver had meant that Puerto Rico had the option of importing food, fuel and supplies more quickly, and for half the cost, in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria.With the 1920 law back in effect, the island is now required to pay much higher costs to import supplies. The Jones Act requires that all goods shipped between U.S. ports be carried by U.S.-owned and operated ships, which are more expensive vessels than others in the global marketplace. That's meant that Puerto Rico pays double the costs to import goods from the U.S. mainland compared with neighboring islands ― and that U.S. vessels are making bank.The return to higher shipping costs won't help Puerto Rico as it tries to climb out of economic devastation. Nearly half of the 3.4 million Americans on the island still don't have drinking water since Maria hit nearly three weeks ago. Just 15 percent have electricity. Many people still haven't heard from loved ones, and at least 39 deaths have been attributed to the storm.Lapan said DHS is "always prepared to review requests on a case-by-case basis and respond quickly" to possible waivers of the Jones Act. But those decisions have to be related to national defense, he said, and are not driven by cost-related matters."We believe that extending the waiver is unnecessary to support the humanitarian relief efforts on the island," Lapan said. "There is an ample supply of Jones Act-qualified vessels to ensure that cargo is able to reach Puerto Rico."Mario Tama via Getty Images Maria Chiclano, who has no running water or power in her home, washes clothes with her sons in the Espiritu Santo river during heavy rains, more than two weeks after Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico.Despite DHS' position, Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossello said Monday night that he wants another extension of the Jones Act waiver."I think we should have it," Rossello told CBS News' David Begnaud. "In this emergency phase, while we're looking to sustain and save lives, we should have all of the assets at hand."President Donald Trump, who is spending Monday golfing, had originally hedged on waiving the Jones Act for Puerto Rico at all, saying "a lot of shippers" didn't want him to do it. He eventually caved to pressure from lawmakers including Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.).McCain has been pushing to get rid of the Jones Act altogether. It costs Puerto Rico hundreds of millions of dollars every year, and he recently introduced legislation to nix the law."Now that the temporary Jones Act waiver for Puerto Rico has expired, it is more important than ever for Congress to pass my bill to permanently exempt Puerto Rico from this archaic and burdensome law," McCain said in a statement to HuffPost. "Until we provide Puerto Rico with long-term relief, the Jones Act will continue to hinder much-needed efforts to help the people of Puerto Rico recover and rebuild from Hurricane Maria."

WeAreBorg here one last time as HASCON wraps up and everypony is headed home. Discovery Family had a booth at the con and we're doing fun silly little social media things but where also showing off a commercial real. I got a few images for you to preview before you see it on the channel.Grab your commercial alerts below!Okay let me break some of these down for you and his the episode they are from.So I'll start out with least site but I think this is a scene from "Once Upon a Zeppelin" or "Uncommon Bond". I could be wrong.Fluttershy is on top of Twilight in this scene. Likely from "A Health of Information".You missed Applejack falling here into Pinkie's party dungeon. Rather sure this is from "Secrets and Pies".This is clearly from "It's Not The Mane Thing About You" with Rarity here hosting in Twilight's castle.This here where Twilight is cringing from a brony encounter is from "Once Upon a Zeppelin".These have have to be from a "Health of Information". Which doctor Fluttershy. I need a toy of this..."Once Above a Zeppelin" which should air right after the My Little Pony Movie.And put course the scene before the Zecora Hut clip we saw from INTMTAY.
For the first time, scientists have studied clouds and wind on the night side of Venus, and they've found that it's very different from the day side, IFL Science reports.That data comes from the European Space Agency's Venus Express spacecraft, which entered orbit around Venus in April 2006 before being crashed into the planet in December 2014. Led by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), the study was published in Nature.We already knew that Venus has a weird super-rotation, where its winds can rotate 60 times faster than the planet. But it seems that on the night side, this process is even more chaotic than on the day side."This study challenges our current understanding of climate modelling and, specifically, the super-rotation, which is a key phenomenon seen at Venus," said Håkan Svedhem, ESA Project Scientist for Venus Express, in a statement.The team found that night-side clouds form large, irregular patterns, dominated by waves that appear to stand still in the atmosphere, called stationary waves. In January of this year, a huge stationary wave was seen on Venus by the Akatsuki spacecraft, stretching for more than 10,000 kilometers (6,200 miles).In this study, the scientists used data from the Visible and Infrared Thermal Imaging Spectrometer (VIRTIS) to study the night side, using infrared to study the clouds. They found they did not move with the atmosphere, an unexpected discovery that was later confirmed by Akatsuki.Stationary waves are thought to form over mountains or other high-elevation regions. Weirdly though, in this data stationary waves were missing in the intermediate and lower cloud levels, up to about 50 kilometers (31 miles) above the surface."We expected to find these waves in the lower levels because we see them in the upper levels, and we thought that they rose up through the cloud from the surface," co-author Ricardo Hueso of the University of the Basque Country in Bilbao, Spain, in the statement. "It's an unexpected result for sure, and we'll all need to revisit our models of Venus to explore its meaning."Akatsuki is continuing to orbit Venus, so it may be able to shed some light on some of the weird things going on with the planet.WN.com, Jim Berrie
How to Make My Favorite Beers Visualization How to Make My Favorite Beers Visualization 8/18/2015Since I seemed to get quite a bit of interest about how to make My Favorite Beers Viz on Reddit, I thought I'd go ahead and create a post explaining the process. I'm going to first outline how to create it from scratch, then explain how to just update mine with your data (less work involved this way).Creating the Full VizStep 1: Get the Data in Your Desired FormatStep 2: Creating the Top 5 Chart1 Star Rating:2 Star Rating:3 Star Rating:4 Star Rating:5 Star Rating:Position of 1/2 Star:Position of 1/4 Star:Position of 3/4 Star:Index:Step 3: Creating the Breweries MapStep 4: Creating the Breweries TableStep 5: Putting It All Together on a DashboardUpdating My Viz with Your Own DataI mentioned in my original post how I got the data, but I'll go ahead and explain it again. On Untappd's Website , you are able to become a "Supporter". Once you do that, you get access to all of your data in an .xls or .csv format. Please note that it costs $5 to become a supporter. Also, if you don't cancel your subscription, they will charge you that $5 every month. So, I just paid the $5, downloaded my data, then canceled my subscription so I don't get charged again. Once you download the data, go ahead and open it up in Excel.Once you have the data opened up, you will see there are fields for the Brewery State and Brewery City. What we need to do is copy both of those and paste them into this Batch Geocode Website so we can create our Brewery Map later. You could try to just use the Brewery State and City to map in Tableau, but a lot of times, Tableau either won't recognize the city, or it will come back as an ambiguous location. So, just paste the city and state into the box on that website, choose Batch Geocode Output Options to be only Latitude and Longitude, then click Geocode. This may take a little while (its best to do about 100 at a time), but it will eventually spit out all of the Latitudes and Longitudes. Then, create two new columns in your spreadsheet and paste the values into there. You will have to use Text-to-Columns with a comma delimiter to split these out. Then you will be good to go ahead and load the data up into Tableau.The only manipulation I did of the data once inside Tableau was a little bit of grouping for the Beer Type field. Untappd uses a lot of different beer types and I just wanted to group some of the similar ones up, so I wasn't stuck with 100 different groups. An example of this is combining all of the different IPA sytles into one over-arching category: IPA. This step is completely optional, but I think it looks much nicer only having 15-20 different groups when looking at the Style filter on the visualization.Doing this is pretty easy. Just drag out the Beer Type field, then Ctrl-Click multiple styles you think would be grouped well together. Once you have multiple types selected, right click and choose "Group". You can see an example photo to the right. Then, you can right click your new group and choose "Edit Alias" to rename your group. Do this to all the styles you feel necessary to group. I used this website as reference.This is probably the toughest part of this whole visualization. This is primarily because of using the stars to signify ranking. Thinking about it, you need not only a full star image, but you also need fractions of that star (1/2 of a star, 3/4 of a star, etc.) I learned how to do this by downloading this workbook . They did a really great job of getting this star rating system to work correctly in Tableau. So, to do this, you are going to need 9 calculated fields:Next, we are going to right-click our index measure and choose "Convert to Discrete". After doing that, you can drag it out to Rows. Now, we are going to create a combined field of Beer Name and Brewery Name. To do this click on Beer Name, then hold ctrl and click on Brewery Name. Then, right click -> Create -> Combined Field. The reason we have to do this is because some beers have identical names across breweries. For example, Bell's, Mt. Carmel, and West Sixth all make a beer named Amber Ale, so creating this field allows us to differentiate between the three Amber Ales. Next, you
AUSTRALIA has won its latest international tug-of-war for a promising young sportsman, pinching WA teen Cameron Burgess from Scotland's grasp.The Fulham defender has starred for Scotland's youth sides for the past year, playing as recently as June, but has officially pledged his future to the Socceroos.FIFA this week officially granted Burgess a clearance to switch allegiance from Scotland to Australia, which binds him to Australia forever.A central defender who can play left-back or defensive midfield, Burgess will now be considered for the two November home friendlies by Socceroos coach Ange Posetcoglou.Football Federation Australia yesterday confirmed the capture of Burgess, who played for Scotland's U19 and 20s and whose granddad Campbell Forsyth was capped by Scotland in the 1960s."Cameron Burgess is a talented young footballer making positive moves in his football career and we're delighted he has confirmed his desire to play for Australia,'' an FFA spokesperson said.delighted to make my professional debut today! gutted about the result but a positive season ahead #COYW #FFC — Cameron Burgess (@CamBurgess95) August 9, 2014"He is a young player we have been watching and we will continue to do so knowing he is committed to the Socceroos.''Burgess has been a bolter for Championship side Fulham, playing four full games this season after making his senior debut last month, age 18 years and 10 months.Standing at 194cm, the stopper has been deployed mainly as a defensive midfielder by Fulham boss Felix Magath.Born in Aberdeen, his family moved to Perth age 11, where he was an ECU Joondalup junior and played for Perth Glory's youth team, before signing for Fulham in 2011.It's believed Postecoglou considered calling Burgess up to the current camp for the Belgium and Saudi Arabia games, but was unsure if the clearance would be granted on time.The same clearance was required for Liverpool's Sydney-born and raised left-back Brad Smith, who's represented England's youth sides for the past four years but made his Socceroos debut against Belgium on Friday.Having been picked in an Australian U20 camp earlier this year, Burgess is now likely to be selected for the Young Socceroos' U20 World Cup qualifiers in October in Myanmar (October 9-23).Cameron Burgess made his debut for Fulham this season. Source: Getty ImagesWith the Socceroos due to play UAE and Qatar on October 10 and 14, a senior call-up beckons in November, which will be Postecoglou's final camp before picking his squad for January's Asian Cup.Burgess' capture is a two-pronged win for Australia - it gives Postecoglou another long-term option in the problematic defensive third, where depth has been tested since the retirements of Craig Moore, Tony Popovic and Tony Vidmar while Lucas Neill appears to have played his last game.Curtis Good and Rhys Williams missed the World Cup through injury, as did WA product Trent Sainsbury, who started in the loss to Belgium.It's with great irony that Australia secured Burgess the same way it lost fellow left-footed stopper Ersan Gulum to Turkey.The Melbourne-born Australian youth international switched allegiance to Turkey after overtures from Guus Hiddink, but having been uncapped in 2013 he and FFA tried to overturn his change.But FIFA's steadfast rules prevented him from doing so, though the Besiktas defender has since become a Turkey regular.
WASHINGTON -- New documents reveal that a high-ranking official in the administration of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) knew that Fort Lee, N.J., had issues with traffic congestion around the George Washington Bridge, long before he authorized a seemingly unnecessary study that closed down lanes to the bridge and made traffic even worse.Fort Lee is an essential access point to New York City, serving as the gateway to the George Washington Bridge, which is the busiest bridge in the United States. In November 2010, Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich (D) wrote to Bill Baroni, deputy director of the Port Authority of New York and Jersey, and complained of traffic problems in the borough. The letter was obtained by The Record in a public records request."On approximately 20 occasions in the last forty days, our Borough has been completely gridlocked," wrote Sokolich to Baroni, who was Christie's top official at the Port Authority. "Traveling from the south to the north end of our Borough takes upwards of one hour. Our safety vehicles are unable to traverse our own thoroughfares to attend to emergencies which place our residents in harms way."Despite these concerns, on Sept. 9, 2013, Sokolich woke up to find that two of the three local access lanes to the George Washington Bridge had been closed, causing dangerous traffic jams in the borough on the first day of school. Neither he nor Port Authority Executive Director Patrick Foye -- who was appointed by New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) -- were given any advance warning.The closures were ordered by David Wildstein, then the director of interstate capital projects and an ally of Christie's. They came just weeks after Sokolich refused to endorse Christie's reelection bid. On Sept. 12, Sokolich said he believed the closures were "punitive," although he later backed off that accusation.Baroni has stated that the closures were part of a traffic study, implying that Fort Lee may not need three access lanes."Every one of you, every one of you on this committee has people in your communities who sit in longer traffic every day because of the special lanes for Fort Lee," Baroni said in November.But he acknowledged that no one ever sought approval for the study, which, without an alternative route, was guaranteed to create traffic congestion.According to The Record, a bridge official said Wildstein also specifically instructed him to keep the lane closures secret from Fort Lee officials. And records indicate, according to the paper, "that traffic engineers predicted it would lead to 600-vehicle back-ups during the morning rush hour that would not subside until noon."Wildstein and Baroni have since resigned and hired attorneys to represent them.In a Dec. 17 press conference on the controversy, Christie stood by Baroni's explanation for the closures, saying that while his appointees did not go through the proper channels for the closures, there was no malicious or political intent in what they did.Still, the controversy has continued to dog Christie, who is considered a possible 2016 presidential contender. Sen. John "Jay" Rockefeller (D-W.Va.), chairman of the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, has asked the Transportation Department to review what happened in Fort Lee."While this type of decision tends to be local in nature, I am concerned about the larger federal implications of what appears to be political appointees abusing their power to hamper interstate commerce and safety without public notice," wrote Rockefeller in his letter to Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx.The inspector general of the Port Authority is also investigating the closures, and several state legislators continue to look into the matter.Last week, Christie said the controversy was "not that big a deal" even though reporters were "obsessed" with it.
New household formations finally seem to be picking up, but it's not because young people are moving out of mom and dad's house, according to a study released Monday by the Terner Center for Housing Innovation at UC Berkeley.In fact, "age groups younger than 55 collectively had negative household formation between 2014 and 2015, while 65- to 74-year-olds accounted for more than two-thirds of overall household formation," the report said.A separate report released Monday by Zillow found that first-time home buyers today are older, renting longer, are less likely to be married and are spending a lot more of their income on homes today versus first-time buyers in the 1970s and 1980s.Both reports add to the growing body of research on why Millennials are taking so long to strike out on their own, which is of great interest to Realtors, home builders and economists.Historically, population growth alone results in the formation of about 1.2 million new households per year on average, said Jed Kolko, author of the Terner Center report. During the recession, this number "got down into only a few hundred thousand" as more people stayed with parents longer or found roommates.Recent census data suggest that the rate of new household formation has started to improve, although there is conflicting data as to the start and size of the increase. The data cited most often showed a big year-over-year increase in the fourth quarter of last year, with gains continuing into this year.It was assumed that Millennials, having found jobs, are now getting their own places.But a recent report from the Pew Center showed that's not true.Even though unemployment among 18- to 34-year olds has dropped dramatically — to 7.7 percent early this year from 12.4 percent in 2010 — people this age are less likely to be living independently. Only 67 percent were living independently early this year, compared with 69 percent in 2010 and 71 percent in 2007, the Pew report said.If young adults are not increasingly striking out on their own, then what accounts for the increase in new household formation?Kolko attempted to answer this question by adding up the population growth between the first half of 2015 and the first half of 2014 for various age groups and multiplying by each group's headship rate. Headship is the percentage of adults who head a household.Like the Pew study, his analysis found that despite the job recovery, the percentage of young adults living with their parents continued to rise, even through June 2015.He found that the headship rate fell or remained flat for all age groups from 20 to 64. "The only notable increase in headship rate was for 65- to 74-year-olds," he said.His conclusion: "Household formation is being driven by overall population growth and the aging of the population, but not a broad increase in headship rates. The recent gain in household formation appears to be due to basic demographic shifts rather than the economic cycle."What the data can't explain is why young adults are living at home even after they get a job."One contributing factor is that 25 to 34-year-olds are decreasingly likely to be married or cohabitating with a partner, and — unsurprisingly — married or cohabitating young adults rarely live with their parents (just 2% do), compared with 31% of those who aren't living with a spouse or partner," Kolko wrote. The decline in marriage among young adults predates the recession.Another possible factor is that "rent affordability is worsening broadly," Kolko said. "When young people move out, it is usually to rent, not to own." After the bubble burst, home prices fell precipitously, but rents did not. "Demand for renting rose as people lost homes to foreclosure or couldn't get a mortgage," he said.Saving up for a down payment on a home is harder when rents are rapidly rising.A third possible reason is that "the quality of jobs being created" is not good enough to let young people move out on their own, at least in the style they have become accustomed to.First-time home buyers: Zillow's report on first-time home buyers echoes some of the same themes.It found that:•First-time buyers are older than than they were in the past. The median age was about 32.5 in 2010-14, versus 29 in 1975-79.•Americans are renting longer before buying a home. The median was 6 years between 2010 and 2014, versus 2.6 years in 1970-74.•They are less likely to be married. Only 40 percent were married in 2010-14, versus 52 percent in 1985-90.•They are spending a lot more of their income on a home. In the early 1970s
First used in a memo dated March 30, 1944, banning "gobbledygook language" and mock-threateaning, "anyone using the words activation or implementation will be shot." Maverick said he made up the word in imitation of turkey noise. Another word for it, coined about the same time, was bafflegab (1952).
A federal appeals court on Friday blocked a North Carolina law that required voters to produce photo identification and follow other rules disproportionately affecting minorities, finding that the law was intended to make it harder for blacks to vote in the presidential battleground state.The Virginia-based 4th Circuit Court of Appeals declared that the measures violated the Constitution and the federal Voting Rights Act by targeting black voters "with almost surgical precision." It marks the third ruling in less than two weeks against voter ID laws after court decisions regarding Texas and Wisconsin.Friday's opinion from a three-judge panel states that "the legislature enacted one of the largest restrictions of the franchise in modern North Carolina history" when it rewrote voting laws in 2013.The appeals court also dismissed arguments by Republican lawmakers that the law was aimed at preventing voter fraud."Although the new provisions target African Americans with almost surgical precision, they constitute inapt remedies for the problems assertedly justifying them and, in fact, impose cures for problems that did not exist," the opinion states.Opponents of the law say the ruling should increase participation by black and Hispanic voters on Election Day in the state that also has closely contested races for U.S. Senate and governor. The U.S. Justice Department, state NAACP and League of Women Voters were among those who sued over the restrictions."This is a strong rebuke to what the North Carolina General Assembly did in 2013. It's a powerful precedent that ... federal courts will protect voting rights of voters of color," said Allison Riggs, who served as the League of Women Voters' lead lawyer.The Rev. William Barber, president of the North Carolina NAACP, said the ruling was "a vindication of our constitutional and moral critique and challenge to the constitutional extremism of our government."The decision was lauded by Democratic Party presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and Attorney General Loretta Lynch, but decried by Republicans including Gov. Pat McCrory as an effort to tilt the electoral balance in the November elections.North Carolina legislative leaders Senate leader Phil Berger and House Speaker Tim Moore, both Republicans, issued a statement that they would appeal the ruling to the U.S. Supreme Court and blasted the judges as "three partisan Democrats.""We can only wonder if the intent is to reopen the door for voter fraud, potentially allowing fellow Democrat politicians ... to steal the election," they said.All three panel members were appointed by Democratic presidents.However, it's unlikely that the evenly divided and short-handed Supreme Court would take the case or block Friday's ruling from governing elections this November, said election-law experts Ned Foley of Ohio State University and Richard Hasen of the University of California at Irvine.Earlier this month, a federal appeals court ruled that Texas' strict voter ID law is discriminatory and must be weakened by November. That followed a ruling by a federal judge in Wisconsin that residents without a photo ID will still be allowed to vote.Hasen said the Obama administration took on the North Carolina and Texas cases as a bulwark against voting restrictions."If North Carolina and Texas could get away with these voting restrictions, it would have been a green light for other states to do so," he said. "I think this is a hugely important decision."North Carolina's voting laws were rewritten in 2013 by the General Assembly two years after Republicans took control of both legislative chambers for the first time in a century. It was also shortly after a U.S. Supreme Court ruling changed the requirement that many Southern states receive federal approval before changing voting laws.The voter ID mandate, which took effect in March, required people casting ballots in person to show one of six qualifying IDs, although voters facing "reasonable impediments" could fill out a form and cast a provisional ballot.North Carolina legislators imposed the photo ID requirement, curtailed early voting and eliminated same-day registration and voters' ability to cast out-of-precinct provisional ballots in their home counties.The appeals court cited data that these methods were used disproportionately by black voters, who also were more likely to lack a qualifying ID, and it blocked the contested provisions of the law.The judges wrote that in the years before the North Carolina law took effect, registration and participation by black voters had been dramatically increasing."We recognize that elections have consequences, but winning an election does not empower anyone in any party to engage in purposeful racial discrimination," the panel said.The Rev. Moses Colbert, a 61-year-old pastor at a church in Gastonia, said the elimination of same-day registration ensured that he couldn't vote on Election Day 2014 shortly after moving within North Carolina. He'd sought to change his voter registration at the Department of Motor Vehicles, but the update didn't get to county officials by the election.He was told his name wasn't on the rolls where he'd just moved. But when he drove 20 miles back to the county
EL SEGUNDO – The Los Angeles Lakers have exercised their team options for the 2018-19 season on Brandon Ingram and Larry Nance Jr., it was announced today by General Manager Rob Pelinka.Ingram, the second overall selection in the 2016 NBA Draft, appeared in 79 games (40 starts) as a rookie last season, averaging 9.4 points, 4.0 rebounds and 2.1 assists, en route to All-Rookie Second Team honors.

On 26 October 1520 a genial young man named Charles, who was already King of Spain, Archduke of Austria, Duke of Burgundy, and Lord of the Netherlands, was also crowned as Holy Roman Emperor Charles V.This guy, whom I am prone to call The Human Chin, had basically inherited a big chunk of the planet, and this one chin man "brought together under his rule extensive territories in western, central, and southern Europe, and the Spanish colonies in the Americas and Asia. As a result, his domains spanned nearly four million square kilometers and were the first to be described as "the empire on which the sun never sets". The title of Emperor was basically icing on the cake.Charles was born 24 February 1500, the eldest son of Philip the Handsome and Joanna of Castile. This means he was Katharina of Aragon's nephew, and Mary I's cousin, and he would later give Henry VIII a hard row to hoe over the English king's attempt to divorce his Spanish wife in favor of Anne Boleyn. In fact, he would keep meddling in English politics for the next several decades, culminating in his son's marriage to Mary I.However, that bedevilment was still years in the future when Charles was crowned, so Henry VIII was probably pleased as punch to have an Imperial in-law. In fact, Charles was betrothed to Mary, his cousin and future daughter-in-law, for a while. Ah, the amusing incest of the royal families!Anyway, Charles went on to have many, MANY historical things happen during his reign that did not (surprising as it is to a Tudor historian like myself) involve either Henry VIII or his children. Charles's armies humbled several powerful men, including the King of France, Pope Clement VII, the Duke of Cleves, and the Ottoman Empire's Suleiman the Magnificent.Strangely, for such a powerful man he was not very power-hungry. When he was in his early 50s, Charles started abdicating his various thrones and giving rule of his territories to his eldest son and his younger brother. Charles retreated from court life to live in seclusion at the monastery of Yuste in Extremadura, where lived alone in a small room with multiple clocks on every wall. Although reclusive in person, the former Emperor maintained correspondence with heirs and acted as a sort of unofficial advisor. Charles died six years after he retired, on 21 September 1558, from what is believed to have been malaria. His mortal remains now lie in the Royal Pantheon of the Monastery of San Lorenzo de El Escorial.

by Borgna BrunnerThe Confederate battle flag, called the "Southern Cross" or the cross of St. Andrew, has been described variously as a proud emblem of Southern heritage and as a shameful reminder of slavery and segregation. In the past, several Southern states flew the Confederate battle flag along with the U.S. and state flags over their statehouses. Others incorporated the controversial symbol into the design of their state flags. The Confederate battle flag has also been appropriated by the Ku Klux Klan and other racist hate groups.

There are well over half-a-million licensed Certified Public Accountants in the US according to a recent study performed by the National Association of State Boards of Accountancy. This is roughly the population of El Paso, TX!This data was assembled from NASBA's interstate database that holds records from all 55 state boards and licensing authorities except four: Hawaii, Wisconsin, Utah, and Delaware. These four states have approved the interstate information sharing process, but have yet to be implemented into the system.How Many CPAs are in the US?I know what you are thinking. If this is the total of all CPA licenses in all states, won't it be double counting the CPAs who are licensed in multiple states? Great question, but they already thought about that and made sure not to double count individual licensed in more than one state.This 2016 figure is up since the 2006 data that showed 646,520 licensed and active CPAs in the United States. This increase is a good sign for the profession and a good sign for the financial industry overall, but it is not that impressive.What Does This Trend Mean?Generally, the growing trend of people becoming CPAs and entering in the profession would be a good thing, and it is. But, the growth has become stagnant over the last few years, only growing at a rate of 1 percent. This isn't a large boom by any means.Actually, if you look back to the 1990s, the total number of first time CPA candidates in the US has declined about 20 percent. This means less people are taking the exam each year as compared with prior years.In other words, people are becoming CPAs at a lessor rate than in previous decades. It's unclear as to what is causing this decrease in people becoming certified, but it is clear that several things in the certification process have changed since the 1990s.For example, most states now require additional work experience requirements and 150 college credit hours to become licensed. These increased requirements most likely have contributed to this decline.Plus, there are many other career options available than in the 1990s. For example, computer science engineers and programmers were not nearly as big as they are today. These careers might be pulling potential future CPAs away from the profession.Keep in mind that just because the rate of people becoming a CPA for the first time is slowing down, it doesn't mean that accounting jobs are going anywhere.How Many Accountants are CPAs?Accounting jobs in the US and internationally keep increasing year over year according to the US Bureau of Labor and Statistics.There are roughly 1.3M accountants in the US and only about 650,000 CPAs. Thus, approximately 50 percent of all accountants are licensed CPAs.No Better Time to Become a CPAThere's no better time to become a CPA than right now. The worldwide demand for certified public accountants is at an all time high. The overall growth might be slowly slightly, but the total demand is still growing.The US Bureau of Labor and Statistics estimates that the demand for accountants will increase upwards of 10 percent in the next 5 years. With all of the new government regulations from healthcare to retirement savings, there is no question that number will be even higher. Business Insider reported that accountants will be the number 1 demanded career over the next 10 years.CPAs are not only needed domestically, they are needed internationally too. Candidates from more than 100 countries around the world are taking the CPA exam, so they can prepare SEC filings for international companies among other things.If you aren't a CPA yet, you should serious consider joining the profession. But before you can become one, you will have to pass the CPA exam. Here are the most helpful study courses that candidates have used to pass the exam. Check them out.

paternosterA 2D programming language with arrows.The documentation is very spartanic, but I hope you can get all the information you need from it.This is a little programming language that follows arrows around the file.The program starts at: ↤, ↥, ↦ or ↧ and then follows the given direction. If ←, ↑, →, ↓, ↖, ↗, ↘, ↙ are hit the program will follow their direction.The code can also modify itself.There are operations, which are basically commands. Some have results, some do actions.Let's look at a little program.↦ M 2 2 "+" M 2 8 "X" ↓ ↑ P ←Okay, there's a lot going on in this. Let's start at ↦, which tells the program to start there. Now, M is called. M is the modify operation. It modifies the character at [2, 2] to be a plus. This changes the M into a +. + is an add operation, and it takes two arguments, like this:1 3 => 4 After that, there is another modify operation which modifies the character on [2, 8] to be a X. X simply terminates the program. The program would now look like this:↦ + 2 2 X+" M 2 8 "X" ↓ ↑ P ←Now there's an arrow which redirects the program. Now we hit P, which prints the result of the next operation. The next operation is + 2 2, so it will print 4. X terminates the program.These are the current operations:A assigns a variable to a value.A example 5will assign 5 to example.P prints a value.P examplewill print 5.p examplewill print 5 without linebreak."" is a string.P "Hello World!"will print Hello World!The operations +, -, /, * and % work as you would think they do.=, < and > are conditional operators. They work like math operations, and return 1 for true and 0 for false.! inverts 1 to 0 and 0 to 1.? is an if operation. After testing, they follow the arrows ↿, ⇃, ↼, ⇀ if the condition is true.? = x 1 ⇃ P "x is not 1." Xwill only print "x is not 1" if x is not one.
CHICAGO (AP) — The Chicago mother thought she knew when it was safe to take her children outside, that she could protect them by sizing up and avoiding the people whom trouble seemed to follow.Then a bullet fired from a gun that D'Antignay Brashear never saw pierced the cheek of her 4-year-old son, Kavan Collins. It fractured the boy's jaw and shattered some teeth before it went out his other cheek, all while he held his mother's hand."He was with his mother, and it wasn't like I was doing something wrong, having him out after hours," said Brashear, a 21-year-old single mother of two, referring to the shooting that happened before sundown June 28 on Chicago's South Side. "I thought he was safe."Kavan is part of a growing roster of children who have been shot in the city this year amid a spike in killings and shootings. More than 330 killings have occurred in the city.So far, no child has died from the gunfire that's often connected to gangs. Children have been struck while doing normal kid things like playing with sparklers, drawing on the sidewalk or holding a mother's hand.Statistics that The Associated Press requested from the Police Department show children ages 10 to 17, who make up more than 260 of the victims so far this year, are at greater risk than those younger than 10. But police records through the end of June showed 15 children younger than 10 had been shot, which is seven more young shooting victims than the same span last year.Four more young children have been shot since the start of July, including a 6-year-old girl who was sitting on a porch Tuesday with her mother and grandmother when a bullet — one of more than 40 fired a block away — struck her in the stomach.Police are trying to determine if the gunfire that struck Tacarra Morgan in the West Englewood neighborhood on the South Side was an exchange between people inside a caravan of cars and a group of men on the street. They say another possibility is that someone in one of the vehicles sprayed the area with a high-capacity assault weapon.Tacarra's condition was upgraded from critical to serious, a hospital official said Wednesday.The shootings, mostly in neighborhoods on the South and West sides, underline what the residents already knew: It's a dangerous time for the city's children as well.But since the recent shootings of young victims haven't been deadly, they have received little attention outside Chicago. The children haven't become national symbols of the city's violence like 9-year-old Tyshawn Lee, who was lured into an alley last November with the promise of a juice box and shot to death, allegedly by gang members out to punish his father.Other children besides Kavan have been struck by gunfire while doing nothing other than being kids, leaving their families to wonder if there's anything they can do to protect them. The victims include:— Six-year-old Jaylene Bermeo, who was drawing with sidewalk chalk on the evening of June 6 in the Logan Square neighborhood on the city's northwest side when she was shot in the back. The bullet punctured her lung and lodged near her heart. Police say a 17-year-old boy accidentally shot the girl when he opened fire on rival gang members as he drove down the block.— Three-year-old Devon Quinn, who was with his dad on Father's Day in a car in the Woodlawn neighborhood on the South Side when someone pulled up and fired at least 10 shots at the vehicle. Prosecutors say the gunman was a gang member who opened fire in a rival gang's territory to pay tribute to a dead member of his own gang. At a court hearing, prosecutors said the boy was left paralyzed from the chest down and that he will never be able to move his limbs or even breathe on his own.— Five-year-old Taniyah Williams and her 8-year-old cousin, Corey Bondurant, who were playing with sparklers on the evening of July 4 in the West Englewood neighborhood on the South Side when someone sprayed the area with bullets. Taniyah was struck in the leg, as were a 19-year-old woman and a 30-year-old man. After the commotion, relatives discovered that 8-year-old Corey was also shot in the leg.Since her son Kavan was wounded, Brashear struggles with how to talk to him about the shooting, even as she continues taking him to doctor appointments and trying to determine what can be done about his facial scars."I don't know how to explain it to him," she said of the boy who has been afraid to fall asleep since the incident and experiences nightmares when he does. "How do you tell a kid, 'Oh, you got shot

It's an odd time in the DC Extended Universe. Patty Jenkins' Wonder Woman has made a huge amount of money, and became an example of how to bring a hero to the screen with style and substance. We're awaiting Aquaman's first movie and the new Justice League film, a long-held dream for DC fans, with a sense of quiet anticipation. The sequel to Suicide Squad is being fast-tracked, and there's a Martin Scorsese-produced Joker movie on the way… Strange things are afoot at the circle DC…Yet with a roster of the most recognisable (and profitable) comic book characters on its books DC appear to be having trouble finding their feet. We're post-Logan, post-Deadpool and each new direction a comic book movie succeeds with could well become a template for all that follow.So, all eyes are on DC for the foreseeable future. Today we received confirmation that Matthew Vaughn is in talks with DC about the sequel to Man of Steel, and it could be a whole new take on the cinematic Superman.The Kick-Ass director was in the mix at Warner Bros. when they were looking to bring about the new cinematic DCEU. The studio ultimately went with the Christopher Nolan/David S. Goyer re-invention of Superman and the visually impressive, yet emotionally cold Man of Steel was the first step into a wider franchise.Commenting on his 2010 pitch, before Man of Steel went into production, Vaughn offered his opinion to MTV on what a new Superman film should be,"I think that's the one thing not to do with Superman, trying to do the serious The Dark Knight version. Superman is about color and fun, or it should be, for me."Speaking to us at the press junket for Kingsman: The Golden Circle, Vaughn confirmed to Scott Davis,"I am planning another Kingman, I've written the treatment and some of the scenes…I don't know what I'm going to do next but I have had chats about Superman, I love Superman. "If somebody asks me to do Indiana Jones, most of the superheros or Star Wars the fanboy in me can't help but be excited."See the interview below,Matthew Vaughn on the new Superman filmTone has been a very difficult element for the DCEU. Though it came in the shadow of The Avengers, Man of Steel, and the follow-up Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, were cast firmly in the, often mocked, 'dark and gritty' mould. At the time it was an understandable decision. Let the tone serve the story, and comparisons to the Marvel films would be moot. However the reaction to Batman v Superman gave the DCEU a stumble on its second step, and the trailers for Suicide Squad subsequently focused heavily on the film's humour. There were dozens of news stories dedicated to how the Justice League film would be lighter and tone, and funnier.If Vaughn, and his long time collaborative partner Jane Goldman, are on board for a new Superman film it could be a bold, stabilising step for the ongoing franchise. When the X-Men franchise from Bryan Singer (another Superman director) faltered with the execrable Last Stand, it was Vaughn and Goldman who reinvigorated the series with X-Men: First Class. They could well do the same with Superman.

There are, as the cops would say, several facts "pertaining" to Mr Khan's kidnapping. Firstly, his son Hafiz Zaenullah, his brother Asif Iqbal and another man – a stonemason called Khaliq Dad – were killed by a drone attack on Mr Khan's home in December 2009. Secondly, he had filed a legal case in Pakistan against the American drone strikes, arguing that they constituted murder under domestic law. And thirdly – perhaps Mr Khan's most serious crime – he was about to leave for Brussels to address European Union parliamentarians on the dangers of American drone strikes in Pakistan.In Madiha Tahir's recent documentary film Wounds of Waziristan, Mr Khan had talked about his family loss. His son Hafiz was a security guard at a local girls' school, and also studying for Grade 10. Asif, who had a Master's in English, was a government employee. Karim Khan saw what was left of their bodies, "covered in wounds". He found some of their fingers in the rubble of his home.Thanks to constant reports of his kidnapping in the courageous Pakistani media and to the Rawalpindi bench of the Lahore High Court who ordered the Pakistani government to produce Karim Khan by next Thursday, the anti-drone campaigner is safe. For the moment.But this is going to set the world on fire. The "drone war", as American journalists inevitably call it – after all, it's not as if al-Qa'ida or the innocent victims are firing back with drones of their own – started under George W Bush, but most of the attacks, 384 of them since 2008, have been authorised by Mr Obama. The statistics of civilian deaths fluctuate wildly since most of the missiles are fired into the Pakistani frontier districts in which the government has little power. The minimum figure for civilian victims is almost 300 dead – some say almost 900 – out of a total of 2,500 killed. At least 50 people are believed to have been killed in follow-up strikes which slaughtered those going to the rescue of the wounded.Of course, the drone syndrome has spread across the Middle East. The missiles rain down on al-Qa'ida and civilians alike in Yemen. The Israelis fired them into Lebanon in 2006; when a youth on a motorcycle fired at a night-time drone over Beirut, it fired back a missile that destroyed a downtown civilian apartment block. In Gaza, the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights reported 825 deaths from Israeli drones during the 2008-09 war, a large percentage of them civilians.Pakistani witnesses have told me that the missiles don't just appear suddenly in the sky. The drones arrive in clusters – 10 or 12 at a time, circling villages for an hour or two – a looking for targets on behalf of their "pilots" in the United States. Until at least 2009, the Americans flew drones – the most impressive was called the Reaper – from air bases inside Pakistan. Hence the sensitivities of the boys from the ISI and their irritation with Karim Khan.The ethical disgrace of the drone syndrome is not that Mr Obama – or some US officer near Las Vegas – decides on the basis of satellite pictures, mobile phone calls, numbers dialled and the speed of vehicles, who should live or die. The really shameful aspect is that the drone war has become normal. It has gone on so long – and been the subject of so much protest, so regularly – that it has become banal, boring, matter-of-fact.It was just the same in the 1990s when the US and Brits went hunting for Iraqi targets over the so-called "no-fly zones" in Iraq. For years they bombed and missiled "military targets" that supposedly threatened them. In the eight months up to August 1999, US and British pilots had fired more than 1,100 missiles against 359 Iraqi targets, flying about two-thirds as many missions as Nato pilots conducted over Yugoslavia during the 78-day bombardment of the same year. As well as anti-aircraft batteries, oil pipelines were blown up, storage depots destroyed and dozens of civilians killed, including several in a Basra housing estate. But each air raid was merely "nibbed" in our newspapers – a nib is a single paragraph in an inside-page News in Brief column – so that an entire air campaign was effectively carried out behind the backs of the US and British public in the years before the 2003 invasion.In southern Lebanon, the Israelis controlled for 28 years a torture prison at Khiam for insurgents and their families – women as well as men – and electricity was frequently used on inmates by Israel's "South Lebanon Army" thugs. Amnesty, Human Rights Watch and the International Red Cross complained. But I will always remember the words of a Swiss Red Cross official when I asked him, within sight of Khiam, why the world did not condemn this dreadful place.

Coors Light Truck Hits Cyclist in CambridgeThe cyclist suffered leg injuries but no head injuries, according to police.Get a compelling long read and must-have lifestyle tips in your inbox every Sunday morning — great with coffee!A Coors Light truck struck a bicyclist this morning in Cambridge near the corner of Massachusetts Ave. and Sidney Street. The bicyclist suffered leg injuries but no head injuries and has been taken to a nearby hospital, according to Jeremy Warnick, a spokesman for the Cambridge Police.The incident occurred at approximately 8:21 a.m. Warnick said the department's traffic enforcement investigation unit was investigating the scene and working to reconstruct the accident.Warnick did not immediately have data available on the number of accidents involving cyclists that have occurred this year. According to the city's Community Development Department, "the crash rate in Cambridge has been decreasing with the steady increase in numbers of people bicycling."Cambridge is often ranked as one of the more bicycle-friendly cities in the U.S. At the end of 2015, People For Bikes, a national non-profit, declared the city's bike lane on Western Ave. to be the best new bike lane in the country.Still, accidents happen too frequently, including a 2015 fatal collision that claimed the life of Marcia Deihl.An hour or so after the incident this morning, the Coors Light truck was still at the corner, cordoned off by caution tape. A badly damaged bicycle frame was wedged underneath the passenger's side of the truck. An officer on the scene said the injuries did not appear to be life-threatening.As noted on the Cambridge Police Department's website, May is Bike Safety Month.

The Timberwolves will attempt to snap a 15-game skid to the Los Angeles Lakers by taking advantage of their struggles on the road Sunday night. For the third time this season, Minnesota (9-10) is close to evening its record. In the most recent attempt, the Timberwolves were 7-8 before a 108-98 loss at Utah on Jan. 21 but have gotten another chance after two wins over teams from the Lone Star State. After a 105-90 victory in Dallas on Wednesday, they topped San Antonio 87-79 on Friday when Ricky Rubio scored nine of his 18 points in the fourth quarter. Kevin Love also had 18 points in his first home game after signing a four-year extension worth more than $60 million, and was one of three Minnesota players to record double-doubles along with Rubio and center Nikola Pekovic. "It's a terrific win for our guys," coach Rick Adelman said. "Hopefully it's really a step forward for us." Minnesota will try to use take another step by improving to .500 after 20 games for the first time since it was 22-22 on Jan. 30, 2007, and by beating the Lakers for the first time since March 6, 2007. The 15 consecutive losses to Los Angeles (11-9) since that 117-107 double overtime victory at home is the league's second-longest active losing streak to one opponent. Minnesota has dropped 16 in a row to Northwest Division rival Portland. The Timberwolves, though, might have one of their best chances to snap that skid as the Lakers are 1-7 away from home. They opened a road-heavy stretch Saturday with a 100-89 loss in Milwaukee. A Kobe Bryant jumper put Los Angeles within four points of the Bucks with 4:52 remaining, but Milwaukee responded with a 15-4 run. The Lakers, who are playing seven of their next eight on the road, are off to their worst start on the road since dropping eight of their first nine in 2002-03. They're also seeking to avoid their first five-game road losing streak since March 4-15, 2007. "There's concern and determination that we want to fix things. If we solve that issue, then we'll be all right," Bryant said after his team lost for the fourth time in five games overall. Los Angeles can help itself by scoring 100 or more points for the first time in 14 games. The Lakers, winners of seven in a row at the Target Center, haven't surpassed 96 in any of their eight road contests. They're averaging 89.6 points away from home but have topped the century mark in seven of their last nine in Minnesota. This time, though, Los Angeles will face a Timberwolves team that's made impressive strides defensively in its first season under Adelman. Minnesota is allowing 93.5 points per game after giving a league-worst 107.7 per contest in 2010-11. The Timberwolves, though, could use more help from Love against the Lakers. The California native has averaged 12.2 points in 11 all-time matchups, his lowest against a Western Conference opponent. He's averaged 10.0 points on 33.3 percent shooting in five home games and had one of two scoreless starts in his career during a 112-95 loss Nov. 19, 2010. Bryant, who broke Jerry West's franchise record for free throws made Saturday, is four field goals shy of surpassing Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's team mark of 9,935.Copyright 2012 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.

Just when it looked as though the Lakers were going to let another road game slip away, Kobe Bryant showed these young pups just how it's done in closing time. Bryant had 35 points and 14 rebounds and Pau Gasol scored 28 to give the Lakers a much-needed road victory, 106-101 over the Timberwolves on Sunday night. Andrew Bynum added 21 points for the Lakers, who won for just the second time in nine road games this season. But it was Bryant who slammed the door, slithering through the holes

Dallas officials have confirmed the first case of Zika virus in the US being transmitted locally via sexual intercourse.Just one day after the World Health Organization deemed the virus as an international health emergency, officials in Dallas County said the patient had contracted the virus via sexual contact and not through a mosquito bite, as reported by NBC.Dallas County Health and Human Services said the patient was infected after sexual contact with a person who had the virus and had returned from a country where the virus is known to be present.The patient, their condition and address have not been identified.Officials said this is the first case of the virus to be transmitted locally in Texas, although there are seven others in Houston and Harris County who have confirmed cases of the virus after traveling abroad.Common symptoms include fever, rash, joint pain and conjunctivitis or red eyes. The virus is usually mild with symptoms lasting several days to a week. However, there is thought to be a link between the virus and a rise in cases of microcephaly – a birth defect, which causes abnormal smallness of the head in babies – in the affected countries."Now that we know Zika virus can be transmitted through sex, this increases our awareness campaign in educating the public about protecting themselves and others," said Zachary Thompson, DCHHS director, to NBC. "Next to abstinence, condoms are the best prevention method against any sexually-transmitted infections."There is currently no medication or vaccine for Zika virus.Officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said last week that the evidence of the disease spreading via sexual intervourse is insufficient to warn all travelers, not just pregnant woman, of the potential danger.Dr. Márcio Nehab, a pediatrician and infectious disease specialist at Fiocruz, a research institute in Rio de Janeiro, told The New York Times: "At the moment we need to be more concerned with the mosquito, the vector known for transmitting the virus."
March 17th, 2010, 10:47 pm #1 2010-03-18T02:47At the 2008 Child Neurology Society meeting in San Jose, California, I presented six children with a unique syndrome I called "Exorcist Syndrome"1. Hyperacute onset - parents point to hour of change2. Ballistic tics - forceful, unrestrained, violent - can put holes in walls, etc.3. Disinhibition - expletives, capable of serious physical harm to self or others4. "Falsetto" vocal change - voice is clear, no aphasia but change in quality of voice - gruff/demonic, Bugs Bunny, infantile5. Symptoms seem to turn on and off like a switch. At times appear completely normal, then symptoms above suddenly rage.These previously normal children acquire this illness suddenly and appear to be demonically possessed. It is not an encephalitis or encephalopathy as the sensorium remains clear, there is no significant cognitive dysfunction.Every one of these children was fully alert, could recall the episode entirely. Video EEG normal in all.MRI was not done in all, but where done show significant reversible basal ganglia swellingLP was not done in all, but where done was normal.No antibiotics or meds (such as neuroleptics) helped significantly. IVIG works - but loses effect in 2-3 weeks. Only PEX produces lasting changesSo the lowdown is don't putz around with antibiotics or drugs, go straight to the big immunosuppressive guns.What causes it? You guessed it ....Every one of these kids have SKY HIGH strep markers, ASO 800-1000 range, anti-DNAase B >1:2720. At this time, I wasn't thinking about other PANDAS triggers .... these children were never tested for Mycoplasma or other triggersIn my view, this is the most severe PANDAS variant and is a neuropsychiatric quasi-emergency due to the risk of violence. It's a central catecholaminergic storm ...We never measured Cunnigham panel on these kids, but I'll bet they show anti-neurotransmitter receptor antibodies.If left alone, it resolves spontaneously in months-years. Resolution is often sudden.Amazingly, outcome is excellent. Cognitive ability is preserved. This is one of the reasons why I believe the outcome in PANDAS, long-term, is good.

Karol and Aleksandra have been traveling the world for the past 6 years. See what it takes to visit 55 countries and 5 continents in a '89 Vanagon.Can you describe your journey for those who did not follow you in the last 5 years ?We are Karol "Charlie" Lewandowski and Aleksandra Ślusarczyk, and we are young travel bloggers from Poland, authors of Bus Around The World blog, who did not have a lot of money but wanted to see the world.We bought an old van for $600 an painted it. We brought our tent, food and just took off. In 6 years we visited more than 50 countries and we traveled more than 100,000 miles on 5 continents. So far we never paid for accommodations and we almost always cooked our own meals.Our car broke down at least 50 times, but we learned how to repair it during the trip. Followers from our blog helped us along the way and people even supported fuel costs. It feels like people from all over the world traveled with us!For the past 6 years we showed through our blog that even with limited budget it is possible to make dreams come true. Our blog is very popular among young people – we have over 80,000 fans on Facebook. Our blog has been voted Best Blog of the Year in 2014 in Poland, and we appeared on major TV stations! We wrote two books about our trips (in Polish) – Bus Around The World. The first expedition and Bus Around The World. America for $8.What is your bus ? Tell us more about it, did you restore some parts yourself?We are traveling in a '89 Vanagon T3. We have our own electric shower, bed, kitchen, 220V power converter and pretty much everything we need!With over 50 breakdowns with the bus, would you say you're a good mechanic now? And could you tell us about the worst breakdown you had and how you've been able to keep going?When we started traveling I didn't know much about mechanic. Now I can fix most things in our freedom vessel, but with a different car it would probably be a different story! In our van probably everything broke down so I know everything about it. One of our worst breakdown was when we had to change the engine in Norway without any access to a garage! But THE worst breakdown occurred in Australia when we lost a wheel. We got stuck in the middle of the desert (obviously our phones would not work), hundreds of kilometers from civilization and with limited water supplies. It's hard to drive a car without a wheel but we were able to move very slowly – somebody had to run next to the wheel and hit it with a stick!How many countries total did you visit ? How many with your van ?We visited about 55 countries, 52 with our van. We shipped the van from Australia to the United States. When we couldn't use the van because transportation was too expensive, we hitchhiked and used local transportation or hire another camper (as we did for example in New Zealand).Can you give us a unusual tip to travel cheap with a van?It depends where you are traveling. In Australia it is a good idea to install WikiCamps app to find free campsites. With the same app in Ukraine and Romania you can ask people if you can park in their driveway! People are very friendly over there and will almost always invite you into their home and tell you amazing stories.Which countries were your favorite to explore with a van ?Australia for their free campsites, beautiful nature, free electric grills and cheap kangaroo meat! It is a paradise for people who want to travel cheaply with a van 🙂Follow Karol and Aleksandra here:
AdvertisementIs the cost of proof of work in bitcoin mining fair? Tomaso Aste of the UCL Centre for Blockchain Technologies at the University College London's Department of Computer Science thinks the current cost large and wasteful, but nonetheless, fair. Aste recently examined the factors that determine the current proof of work cost in a study titled "The fair cost of Bitcoin proof of work."Aste noted that bitcoin has proven that untrustful peers can exchange value over the Internet without any third party intermediary or trusted authority, as bitcoin has surpassed $10 billion in capitalization and processes tens of thousands of daily transactions with any serious challenge of attack.Computationally Intensive ProcessThe verification and cryptographic sealing mechanism that is critical to the bitcoin network involves a computationally intensive process. A large number of nodes in the bitcoin network engage in the verification process.The process provides a mechanism that avoids false duplications of voters and forces voters to demonstrate computational capacity. To secure a qualified majority, the system employs a cryptographic sealing process that is computationally intensive. The process includes a challenge called "proof of work." The first node that solves this challenge receives a bitcoin reward. This mechanism, called "mining," enables new bitcoins to be created.Miners worldwide generate several billions hashes (10^18 or one Exahash) every second. With existing hardware, the computation of a billion hashes consumes between 0.1 to 1 Joule of energy. Hence, roughly a billion watts (1GW/sec) are used globally every second to create a valid proof of work.The amount of energy for this process accounts for about $50,000 per hour, although electricity costs change worldwide.Miner Reward: 12.5 BitcoinsSince the system currently processes under 10,000 transactions hourly, the per-transaction cost exceeds $5. The user does not pay the cost. The miners pay the cost and are rewarded with the accreditation of new bitcoins.The individual proof of work reward was 25 bitcoins leading up to the halving, equating to about $15,000 at current change.The mining community is estimated to consume an average of around $50,000/6, equaling $8,333 in electricity every 10 minutes to create a block, receiving around $15,000 in remuneration. This makes the mining operation profitable, even taking into account the infrastructure and hardware cost.The electricity cost for one year of mining totals more than $400 million. This can be viewed as a significant waste.The reward, now cut in half to 12.5 bitcoins, will leave smaller profit margins, Aste noted.Proof Of Work BenefitsProof of work allows the blockchain to remain "pure" and lets an entire community compete to verify the validity of transactions and make attacks to the system costly.Is the cost justified? Aste claims the cost should make a double spending attack too expensive to be executed.A double spending attack would occur when someone tries to gain more bitcoin by spending the same bitcoin with different users. The attacker would attempt to double spend the highest amount of bitcoin possible. The amount is limited to that which is normally exchanged within a block, which is currently about $1 million.A transaction that includes a higher sum than the total transaction value in a block will attract attention from the network. This reality limits double spending to about $1 million. While the duplication can be repeated serially or in parallel several times, it does not affect the present computation's outcomes.Protection From AttacksThe attacker can try to gain a fraction of $1 million. To do so, the attacker has to be sure both the duplicated transactions are validated. This requires a fork with two blocks attached to the previous block.If the attacker has sufficient computing power, it is possible to generate two valid hashes to seal both blocks to create the impression that both transactions were verified. For a final transaction settlement, it is necessary to wait for six new blocks to join the blockchain to ensure the transaction is unlikely to be reverted.The attacker has to generate six valid hashes before the double spend transaction can be considered settled. The attacker only has to artificially validate one of the two forks, the shortest. The system will consider the other to be valid and let to propagate by other miners. The attacker can propagate it as well.It is unrealistic to assume no one will notice the propagating fork, Aste noted, but this assumption is made for the purpose of this hypothesis.Also read: How proof of work…worksHow Attacks Are DiscouragedThe fork's artificial propagation cost is the proof of work cost times six. The attacker will profit if the cost is less than the gain. The break-even point is represented by the following equation: the fair equilibrium cost of proof of work equals the duplicated fraction of the value of a block divided by the number
While 13,255 refugees were admitted in August, that number plunged to just 2,070 in March. So far during the 2017 fiscal year, 45,732 people have been admitted, just a few thousand short of Mr. Trump's proposed cap.Refugee groups now predict that entries into the United States could increase so rapidly that the total number of refugees admitted by Sept. 30, the end of the fiscal year, could exceed 70,000. That is well below the 84,994 refugees admitted in fiscal year 2016, but not by nearly as much as many advocates had feared.Refugee advocates were delighted by the State Department's decision."This is long overdue, but we're very happy," said Mark Hetfield, president and chief executive of HIAS, an immigrant aid society.But many of the advocates said they were worried that any reprieve would be temporary."The president's proposed budget cuts for 2018 would mean we would have a much smaller program next year no matter what happens with his executive orders," said Erol Kekic, executive director of the immigration and refugee program at Church World Service.Perhaps even more worrisome, refugee advocates said they had seen a slowdown in security screenings by the Department of Homeland Security, whose checks are required for refugees to enter the United States.Still, even Republicans in Congress have said that few of Mr. Trump's proposed budget cuts to foreign aid and the State Department's budget would be adopted into law.In a visit this week to Syrian refugee camps in Turkey, Nikki R. Haley, the United Nations ambassador, all but urged Congress to reverse Mr. Trump's proposed cuts in aid to refugees."It's starting the conversation," Ms. Haley said of Mr. Trump's proposed budget, according to The Associated Press. "It doesn't mean that's where it will end up. He's going to have that conversation with Congress on where we should fall on this."
6/16/2014 – by James FedewaI moved to Pacific Beach in San Diego about 2 months before I turned 21 years old (April 1993). My initial San Diego experience was at a very impressionable time in my life.I only "liked" professional baseball and football, but the San Diego community (and local teams) only enhanced that "like" and grew it into a love. I quickly grew into a diehard San Diego Padres (and Chargers) fan and I have been a fanatic of those two teams for the last 22 years. Tony Gwynn was the superstar for the Padres and he became my favorite baseball player the more and more I watched and listen to him.Living in San Diego, I went to as many baseball games as I could. Back in my early twenties, the Padres played at Jack Murphy Stadium, and the cheap tickets in right field were only $7 (back when baseball was considered the affordable sport), so we went to a lot of games. The best games were the Dodger/Padres of course, and Tony Gwynn always showed up and played great. Back then the Padres and Tony Gwynn were known as The Dodger Killers, as they always managed to beat their biggest rival L.A (the Giants on the other hand were quite opposite). It was Tony Gwynn's team for 20 years and San Diegans loved their perennial all-star. No matter how terrible the Padres were, San Diego always had Tony Gwynn…In the 2001 season, the last season of Gwynn's career, was my most remembered of him. How he lasted on the same team his whole career made me admire him more, as he taught sacrifice. Tony did not start that season, as he had a knee injury and he was primarily used as a pinch-hitter. Most Padres fans knew it was going to be Gwynn's final season, and since he did not start that season, it made attending every game even more important (just so you can get that final glimpse of the Mr. San Diego legend). As most pinch-hitters are used, in the latter innings of close games, fans would be anxious (at a warm idle) in hope the Padres could get a runner in scoring position, then Padres fans could "possibly" see Tony Gwynn come in for a pinch-hit. I got to see one of those close games, might have been his last too, and Tony hit a pinch hit single, drove in the winning run and the crowd went haywire.I think the older we get, the more emotional we get, or we can actually recognize what we can lose even more (especially when we can relate our own experiences with those reminders of our past). The story of my favorite baseball player had so many chapters of Tony Gwynn's 20 year career, with each year (or Chapter) being so different. From a young kid and growing into the man I am today, I can feel and empathize what Tony Gwynn did then, and related it to me, and what I was doing then. Being just a fan of a guy lets me combine his career and achievements, to where I've been in my own life.I was always a fan of Tony Gwynn (the player, the person, the coach and the broadcaster). These "links" of history that we tie with the players we admire the most helps us look at ourselves (by reminding us of our own past and where we are now). I was only a fan of Tony Gwynn and I never met him, but he was Mr. San Diego and everyone in San Diego (and beyond) loved him. The moments of Tony Gwynn's career are joined and bonded together through my life, as well as other fans across the globe. Remembering what he did makes me think of where I was, when he did it. When I was 20, 30 and 40 years old, Tony Gwynn's career accomplishments remind me of several moment of my own life. When Tony Gwynn spoke, people were drawn to him. Aside his baseball accomplishments; his gift of gab, his charisma, and his smile were mesmerizing and he will truly be immortalize in my heart and with all baseball fans alike.Tony Gwynn, Mr. San Diego, died today from cancer. He was 54 years old.Advertisements
Django or Drupal for Content Management: Which Fits your Needs? If you're building or updating a website, you're probably wondering about which content management system (CMS) to use. A CMS helps users — particularly non-technical users — to add pages and blog posts, embed videos and images, and incorporate other content into their site. CMS options You could go with something quick and do-it-yourself, like WordPress (read more about WordPress) or a drag-and-drop builder like Squarespace. If you need greater functionality, like user account management or asset tracking, or if you're concerned about security and extensibility, you'll need a more robust CMS. That means using a framework to build a complex website that can manage large volumes of data and content. Wait, what's a framework? Put simply, a framework is a library of reusable code that is easily edited by a web developer to produce custom products more quickly than coding everything from scratch. Django and Drupal are both frameworks with dedicated functionality for content management, but there is a key difference between them: Drupal combines aspects of a web application framework with aspects of a CMS Django separates the framework and the CMS The separation that Django provides makes it easier for content managers to use the CMS because ...

The scientists did lots of cool programming stuff. But they did not use version control, so they introduced git :-) They also had lots and lots of data, so they introduced Apache Spark. Their data sets were in ascii files, which are huge. So the ascii files need to be parsed. He showed an example of a file with DNA data. Ouch, it turns out to be pretty complex because there are quite some exceptions. Fields (in this example) are separated by semicolons. But some of the values also contain semicolons (quoted, though). So the generic python code they used to parse their DNA data was littered with "if" statements. Unmaintainable. You probably heard that hard problems need to be split up into smaller problems. Yes, that's true. But the smaller parts also need to be combined again. So: smaller parsers + a combining them again. A parser takes an input and returns the part that matched and the part that remained. He showed parsy as a library for "parser combinators". Many languages have such libraries. He demonstrated how to combine those input/match/remainder ...

Before we get into the deliciousness above, let me thank you all for making this year's NEDA week post—sharing your ED story with a partner or friend—so lovely. I appreciated all of the comments, especially those from people who are just on the brink of sharing with their partners. I hope you all find strength and support in the CR community! NEDA week is still up and running, so please keep these issues fresh in your minds. And, fellow bloggers, let me know if you write NEDA posts of your own!I don't think I have to say too much about the deliciousness above. Guacamole. Sweet potatoes. Sweet potatoes grilled with a spice rub. What more could one ask for, except seconds and thirds? Seriously, sweet potatoes are one of my favorite foods: they're one of the more healthy and natural ways to get your carb attack on, and their sweetness gives them tremendous versatility. They're standard dinner fare for me, but I can easily eat them for breakfast, as we all just learned when I posted my sweet potato breakfast salad with almond butter protein dressing:Today's recipe is quick and easy, but it's also an impressive appetizer dish to share at parties or as a first course for dinner at home. I grilled my sweet potato rounds on my Cuisinart indoor grill/griddle (this year's holiday request), but baking them will work every bit as nicely. And of course, if you have an outdoor grill, have at it. Grilling sweet potatoes brings out their caramel flavors, and it's a great opportunity to crack out a spicy, smoky mixture of seasonings.Chili-Rubbed Sweet Potato Rounds with Guacamole (vegan, gluten free, soy free)Serves 4For the chili spice rub:2 tbsps chili powder1 tsp paprika (I use regular here, but use smoked paprika if you want a smoky flavor!)1 tsp coriander1/2 tsp cinnamon1/2 tsp sea saltDash cayenne pepper (omit if you don't want the heat)For the dish:1 large sweet potato, sliced into 1/4 inch roundsCoconut oil (optional)1 recipe classic Choosing Raw guacamole1) If you're baking your sweet 'taters, pre-heat oven to 425 degrees. If you're grilling them, first prepare a pot of boiling water with a steamer insert.2) Mix spices together for the rub.3) Oven method: Brush or spray potatoes lightly with coconut oil (you can omit this if you're avoiding oils). Sprinkle them with the spice rub. Roast round for about 12-15 minutes, or until golden on the bottoms. Flip and roast for another 12-15 minutes.Grill method: Steam sweet potato rounds for about eight minutes–you don't want them cooked through, but you do want them to be most of the way there. Remove from steam heat, spray or brush lightly with coconut oil (totally optional), dust with chili rub, and transfer to grill. Grill for about 4-5 minutes on each side, until nicely browned.4) Whip up a batch of classic CR guacamole. Transfer it to a plastic bag, and snip one corner of the bag so that you can pipe out the guac (I almost wrote "pipette out" the guac–too much biochem lab).Pipe the guac onto the rounds as if you were frosting cupcakes. (NB: My guac didn't look much better after piping than it might have if I'd used a spoon. So this step, while nice, is definitely optional).5) Serve, savor, swoon.The light, bright, lemony guacamole pairs perfectly with the dense, sweet, and smoky sweet potatoes in this scrumptious recipe. Added bonus? Lots of complex carbs and healthy fat make this an incredibly satiating—as well as a supremely delicious—snack or appetizer.Healthy, simple, and satisfying. The best kind of party food.Hope you keep this recipe in mind for either winter or summer entertaining; one of its benefits is that it features produce from both seasons, and it's very versatile!With that, it's back to a long day of biochem lab and Orgo reports. Happy hump night.xo
Ok, so this is a fairly short and not all too in-depth TL;DR this week for a couple of reasons. 1) If you watched our Music Monday on B.A.P.'s "Power" you'd remember that Martina lost her voice. It's still lost. Slowly coming back, but she sounds like a 439 year old witch whose lungs are made of dust. So, I had to do this TL;DR by myself. Also 2) I'm kinda sick. Not voice-losing sick, but coughing up randomly and uncontrollably. So, the less talking the better. Kinda can't do that when your only job is to talk on camera! Ah! So, like the shorter and easier Music Monday, we've got a shorter and easier TL;DR.But it's good that I did this one on my own, because it's a question that's geared at me specifically, about being a tall guy in Korea, which Martina can't really answer. Though she did remember a lot of the things that I don't remember about being tall in Korea, like almost bumping my head on low-hanging signs. Some of these things you get so used to that you just don't think of anymore!I definitely can say that I feel like Korea is a smaller country than Canada. Geographically, obviously, since Canada's the second biggest country in the world, but in terms of real estate and architecture: things in Korea are a lot more crammed, and so – being a big guy – I feel it a lot more than other people would, I think. Or maybe I don't? Maybe short people feel cramped more than I do? Maybe all of the people ricocheting off my body affect you more than it does me? I don't know. Sometimes I feel like flipping a car over to try to get some room.Also, just in case you forgot, this picture is and always will be relevant. Just in case you don't know where this is from, it's from long time ago when we did an episode of Star King with Super Junior. Super Junior, and everyone else for that matter, were quite short compared to us. People theorized that the picture was doctored, or that I'm 7 feet, 32 inches tall, or that the lens barrelled and warped people into being taller/smaller. Not the case. Totally undoctored. Just…an awesome picture. One of my favorites ever :D

John Goossens scored his first MLS goal against San Jose to earn the Fire a 1-0 win at home. The Dutchman sits down with Paul Tenorio to discuss his return from an early season injury, his first MLS tally, and a confident Fire side.
This event occurred to me at least twelve years ago, and I still don't know what happened.Driving home from a Friday night shift at the newspaper, my car's cruise control set on 55 mph, I drove by a road sign I've driven by hundreds of times. It reads, "Orrick: 5 Miles." Just as I went by, the Rolling Stones "Gimme Shelter" came on the radio.Perfect. I lived in Orrick, Missouri, at the time, and "Gimme Shelter" was not only my favorite Rolling Stones tune, it was also four minutes, thirty-seven seconds long, which would last me all the way home.Then my drive fell out of reality.A pull on the car engine snapped me out of the road hypnosis that had overtaken me. It took me a few seconds to realize that pull was the cruise control trying to keep the speed steady up a hill. The trouble was there were no hills between that road sign and my turnoff. Looking out the window didn't help; a thick fog had enveloped the car and I could barely see the dotted line on the road. I slowed the car and drove up two more hills before I saw a light piercing through the fog.Turning onto a gravel road toward the light, I found myself in the parking lot of a Jehovah's Witness church and knew where I was – five miles on the other side of my turnoff. As I sat in the parking lot, my car in park, trying to figure out how I missed the exit, I heard something I couldn't believe. "Gimme Shelter" still played on the radio. It continued to play for another minute and a half.After I calmed a bit, I put the car in gear, pulled back onto the highway and went home. The fog quickly dissipated. I'd driven ten miles in three minutes at 55 mph. That wasn't possible. What happened to me?Cases of missing time and distance are as common as they are confusing. The Internet is littered with tales of travelers entering a fog only to discover they're suddenly 300 miles away from home, or they've gone nowhere, but it's inexplicably hours later. Explanations range from time slips, to dimensional slips, to alien abduction. Whatever the case, Brandon White of Maryville, Missouri, has experienced missing time and distance; more than once. "The first time I was about ten and I was walking out in the front yard," White said. It was just after lunch.As White went toward a thick ring of pine trees that surrounded his family's farmhouse, he saw something floating on the other side of the tree line. "It was pale, sort of translucent," he said. "It was passing between our house and the neighbor's house. I thought it was a blimp."His afternoon suddenly disappeared. "The next thing I remember was coming in for dinner; 5 or 5:30," he said. "I didn't think about it at the time. As a kid, time was nothing."But five hours of his life were just gone.In his teens, his life got stranger. "At 13 or 14 I stopped sleeping. I was deathly afraid of sleep," he said. "I would fall to sleep, get into an REM sleep, and start screaming. I would wake up in strange places. In the yard, on the porch, upside down hanging from my bunk bed." White said he doesn't remember when he's been able to catch more than four hours of sleep a night. "I had very vivid nightmares," he said. Those nightmares often included a bird. "A big black crow. It would flap over my face, trying to take my breath."Later in his teens when White worked at Long John Silver's in a town 38 miles away, he experienced more missing time. "I was riding my motorcycle. I remember that night very specifically. I worked a double shift," he said. "Before I left town, I filled up my (gas) tank." As he pulled onto a gravel road toward his parent's house, he saw an orange ball hanging low in the sky. "I stopped and thought, 'the moon's a weird color,'" he said. "Then I saw it was not the moon. The moon doesn't block the landscape." As he got closer, he saw this orange ball was thirty to forty feet in diameter, and hovered five or six feet off the ground.He got off the motorcycle three hours simply disappeared. "It's the last thing I remember," he said. "It was 7:35 p.m. At 10:30 p.m. I pulled into Dad's driveway and something zoomed over me and disappeared into a valley."He stopped the bike and got off, leaving it running as he dashed to a fence to look for the light. It had gone
LOS ANGELES -- Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler wants consumers to be able to say goodbye to their cable set-top boxes.In a Los Angeles Times op-ed piece published Thursday, Wheeler is proposing a new rule that would require cable and satellite video companies to offer consumers the option to receive their channels through apps that provide streaming video over the Internet. Consumers have long chafed at having to pay for set-top boxes to get a cable signal."If adopted, consumers will no longer have to rent a set-top box, month after month," Wheeler wrote. "Instead, pay-TV providers will be required to provide apps -- free of charge -- that consumers can download to the device of their choosing to access all the programming and features they already paid for."Wheeler's proposal comes six months after the Federal Communications Commission voted 3-2 along party lines to begin crafting rules intended to spur competition in the set-top box market by developing technology standards so that third-party devices and apps could decode pay-TV signals.Such a service would enable consumers to watch cable channels over on an Internet-connected television or device such as an Xbox, Roku or AppleTV.Cable and satellite companies collect a combined $20 billion annually in rental fees, adding to the overall cost of cable or satellite service. Wheeler cited an analysis that said consumers pay an average of $231 annually for the use of a box.Wheeler's plan was praised by consumer groups but met with strong criticism by the cable industry. The companies and their trade group, the NationalCable and Telecommunications Assocation, characterized Wheeler's plan as an act of government overreach that goes beyond the FCC's authority."This proposal would far exceed the Commission's legal authority and improperly insert the government into private contract negotiations between payTV distributors, content creators and device manufacturers," the NCTA said in a statement.Wheeler, who has long been an advocate of bringing down the cost of video service to consumers, said studies have shown that 84 percent of consumers believe their cable bill is too high. About 99 percent of the nation's 100 million pay-TV subscribers rent at least one set-top box."We keep paying these charges even after the cost of the box has been recovered because we have no meaningful alternative," he said.Wheeler also believes the industry needs to adapt to the technological changes that have already upended the television industry through the increased number of programming choices they have provided. A rapidly growing number of consumers, especially in the 18 to 34 age group, are turning to online streaming for their video content and want more options through Internet platforms."This proposal is an important step in giving consumers new, innovative choices in a market that's had limited -- if any -- competition for years," Consumers Union said in a statement.Wheeler's plan gives large pay TV providers, such as Comcast and DirecTV, two years to offer streaming apps to their customers. Medium-sized companies would have an additional two years while smaller providers would be exempt.About 90 percent of cable and satellite customers are served by the companies that will have to adopt the service in two years.Cable companies already have the technology that offers their channels through apps, but the rental of a set-top box is required.Opposition from the cable industry, which has been anticipating Wheeler's move, came quickly after his official announcement. Comcast, the largestcable provider in the U.S., said the proposed regulation would hurt the technological development of apps."Heavy-handed government technology mandates have a long history of failure," the company said in a statement. "The Chairman's approach would likely meet the same fate, while causing real damage to the thriving apps marketplace and real harm to consumers."Charter Communications called Wheeler's plan "a valid goal," but argued the marketplace is already meeting consumer demand for apps that provide video service. "The FCC's mandate threatens to bog down with regulations and bureaucracy the entire TV app market that consumers are increasingly looking to for innovation, choice and competition," the company said in a statement.It's not clear whether Wheeler's proposal will be approved by the FCC. Comissioner Michael O'Rielly echoed the concerns of the industry."I will review this proposal carefully over the coming days and weeks, but at the outset it appears to exist within a fantasy world of unlimited Commission authority," he said. "The Commission is and must remain in the business of licensing spectrum and infrastructure, not content."MPAA Chairman and Chief Executive Chris Dodd said he will need assurance that an FCC mandate to provide streaming apps does not interfere with the ability of program producers and creators to negotiate issues related to online usage of their content."The FCC must not encroach upon copyright holders' discretion in how they exercise or license the exclusive rights," Dodd said.Wheeler's proposal did receive praise
Different cuts of beefNutritional value of each cutRecipes for each cutAnd much moreBackgroundFor bodybuilders, beef is an important part of a healthy diet. Shopping for the different cuts of meat can be difficult sometimes, especially if you don't know the nutritional value of the beef. In this section, we will show you the following:Most American cattle breeds are descendents of animals imported, possibly by the Vikings, during the early 1000s. Columbus and other early explorers also brought cattle on board their ships. Today, over 100 million head of cattle live in the United States and Canada. Beef is available in many different cuts, including steaks, roasts, brisket, stew meat, and ground beef. Tender cuts come from the ribs and loin. Tougher cuts come from the rump and shoulder. Prime beef has thin layers of fat, called marbling, running visibly through the muscle. Choice beef has little or no marbling but a layer of pinkish fat on the outer edges.The Importance Of BeefMany of us are trying to eat healthily. We are adding more whole grains and fresh vegetables to our diets, and eating less saturated fat. Beef is part of a healthy diet. Beef makes a meal filling, satisfying, and festive. Think back to the wonderful standing rib roasts of Christmas past, those made-to-order steaks for the annual 4th of July barbecue, or mom's famous spaghetti and meatball special. Beef is what makes the meal memorable. You can still enjoy these classics. Remember, while red meat does contain a fair amount of fat, it is also a concentrated source of protein, vitamins, and minerals. Eaten in moderation, it can be a part of a well balanced diet.Beef is divided into primal cuts. From these larger sections, your butcher makes smaller cuts suitable for individual or family size portions. Different cuts require different treatment. For instance, chuck makes an excellent roast, but will be tough and chewy if pan-broiled. With this in mind, we have prepared this handy chart. The following is by no means an exhaustive list of the possible divisions of each section, but will give you some idea of the special characteristics and uses of each area. Besides being a simple anatomy lesson, it will help you make sense of that long meat counter.Nutritional Breakdowns - Which Cut Is Best?Each cut has a different amount of calories, protein and fat. As a bodybuilder, the choice you make can make a big difference. Check out the table below. Highlights of the best from this table are below the table.NOTE: Beef does not contain any carbohydrates.Cut Type Grams Protein Grams Fat Calories Chuck, 3 oz. 23.2 h20.2 282.2 Ribs, 3 oz. 18.6 25.1 306.1 Short Loin, 3 oz. 19.7 19.8 262.6 Sirloin, 3 oz. 23.6 13 219.3 Flank, 3 oz. 22.4 10.6 192.1 Round, 3 oz. 25.6 8.1 183.6 Beef Brisket, 3 oz. 21.3 24.2 309.4 Corned Beef Brisket, 3 oz. 15.4 16.1 213.3The Winning Bodybuilding Cut?Although most of the beef cuts are pretty good when eaten in moderation, the Round cut is by far the best! It has the highest protein AND the least fat. Learn more about each type below and find great recipes!ChuckMeat is muscle. Meat that has been heavily exercised tends to be tough, and chuck fits this description. However, chuck does have a saving grace. There is a lot of connective tissue in this area, in particular collagen. Collagen melts during cooking, making the meat intensely flavorful. Cuts from this area benefit from slow wet cooking methods, such as stewing, braising, or pot-roasting.Blade Roast - This inexpensive cut lies next to the ribs, and is more tender than most chuck. It makes an excellent roast. Alternatively, you can be cut the roast into a rib-eye steak, and use the meat above and below the bone for stir-fry dishes.Chuck Steak - A good choice for kabobs if well marinated.Nutritional HighlightsChuck roast (fat trimmed to 1/4 inch [0.6cm], braised),, 3oz.

What IT: Chapter 2 Should Do With The Book's Most Psychedelic Parts, According To Bill Skarsgard By Eric Eisenberg Random Article Blend SPOILER WARNING: The following article contains certain spoilers about the end of Stephen King's IT, and therefore potential spoilers for the developing IT: Chapter 2. If you have not read the book, and don't wish to know how it all ends, please bookmark this page and save it until you're ready to read! Prior to Andres Muscheitti's film, there were a few reasons why Stephen King's IT was considered unadaptable in the medium, and only one of them was the extreme length of the story. Another is the fact that the end of the book winds up getting extremely trippy and weird in its third act, with both the kids and adults' storylines leading to confrontation with the titular monster on an inter-dimensional battlefield. Obviously this element was entirely left out of the recently released movie, but star Bill Skarsgard really wants to see IT: Chapter 2 fully embrace it. Discussing the nature and mind of Pennywise in the novel, he recently said, It's hardly answered in the novel, either. I mean, it's very abstract. And I kind of like that. It could be almost a sort of surrealistic sort of psychedelic trip if you go into the mind of Pennywise. And if you've read the novel you know that they do actually go into his mind. Or they go into this trans-dimensional place, and they sort of beat him in this place. Which might be interesting, what that place would be, and what would it look like. There's opportunities, I think, and I'm excited for it. Bill Skarsgard is currently promoting his second Stephen King adaptation of 2017, the new Hulu series Castle Rock, but while speaking with IGN at New York Comic-Con this past weekend he also took the time to talk about what he would like to see in IT: Chapter 2. The actor was asked about the possibility of the sequel delving deeper into his monstrous character's mind, and Skarsgard noted that he thinks there are some fantastic visual opportunities to explore with that idea in the source material. In the novel, there are a couple chapters that dive into the nature of Pennywise, and it's revealed that he is an ancient, interdimensional entity who feeds on fear for sustenance so that he can last through his 27-year hibernation periods. Defeating IT requires the fight being brought to ITs own home turf - in a "ceremony" called The Ritual of Chud - and how it's described in the book would be a sincere challenge to directly adapt on screen. The Losers Club performs the Ritual of Chud when they are both children and adults, but just because it wasn't featured in Andres Muschietti's IT doesn't mean that it won't wind up in IT: Chapter 2. In fact, Bill Skarsgard argues that the sequel actually should be a very different film, as what scares children and what scares adults are two very different things, and that deserves exploration. Said Skarsgard, The first movie worked so well at what it is trying to do, I think, and ultimately that is the kids' story, and you follow these kids and you sort of fall in love with these kids. And the second one will be the adult story. And I think the right way to do it is to make that movie actively different. ... I think there might be worth exploring sort of the psychological aspects of horror, but also maybe the sort of cosmological existence of this being. What is he, and where does he come from? When didn't actually know when we would be getting IT: Chapter 2 for what felt like a long time to an impatient mind - but that mystery was solved a few weeks back. Warner Bros. has officially dated the follow-up for September 6, 2019, and we will keep you up to date with all major updates!

The bug has been confirmed on Windows 10, with both Windows 7 and Windows 8 working as of now.A bug has been discovered in Windows 10 which causes files copied from one location to another on a PC-connected Android to vanish completely if the built-in file manager File Manager is used for the operation.The issue affects only files that are being moved or copied from an Android folder or storage device to another location on the same Android phone or tablet using an MTP or PTP USB connection, and it does not seem to impact copying data on a Windows 10 PC.This means, when users connect an Android device to a Windows 10 PC and try to move files with File Explorer from the phone to an SD card or vice versa, this will result in data vanishing completely. The transfer appears to be working, but the files do not reach the destination folder, with no recovery possible for the time being.The bug has been confirmed on Windows 10, with both Windows 7 and Windows 8 working correctly as of now. Also, there are a number of Android phones which appear to be affected, including OnePlus and LG models, Google's Nexus and Pixel, HTC 11, Nokia phones, and several Xiaomi and Sony models. On the contrary, Samsung's and BlackBerry devices are working correctly, user reports indicate.While Microsoft has not yet acknowledged the bug problem, the easiest way to save your data right now is to create a backup which will allow you to restore files at any given time.Also, this issue is affecting only Android-to-Android transfers, a possible workaround is to copy data from the Android device to the PC first, and only then move it back to the new location on Android. This would be beneficial to the user as they would be creating a backup of their data as well at the same time.
Apart from cultural illiteracy and hate campaign in public space, such announcements also have some dynamics in the hyper-connected digital worlds of memes and social networks. Hence, the current wave of anti-Brahmin actions has to be understood in that context.Linguistic Ethnic Nationalism + Marxism = Secessionist Nazi CultsDravidian polity has consistently used the term Aryan as a racist slur against Tamil Brahmin communities. The official magazine of Dravidian movement proclaimed on 28-09-1955: "If we are to lynch the Aryans in the middle of the roads in broad day light all day long, today none shall care to question that". However, in reality that was not the case. The Tamil Nadu government, then led by K Kamaraj as chief minister, did not hesitate to take action against Dravidian propaganda demeaning the sacred thread.Subsequently, the cultural reality and strains of real politics made even Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) refrain from rabid anti-Brahmin rhetoric. In 1955, C N Annadurai, who later became chief minister, explained that if they could destroy caste system by destroying Brahmins – the same way Hitler did with the Jews – it would be "sensible to an extent". But, he explained that the caste system, which he described as 'Aryanism' had become a part of Tamil society at large, and hence they had to resort to campaigning without violent means.Deep down they had strong hatred for Hinduism, which despite all social stigmas, still provided a democratic religious system, and hence it was an obstacle to their totalitarian ideologies and theologies. So, anti-Brahminism is aimed not just at Brahmins, but its ultimate aim is to destroy Hinduism and Hindu communities. Naturally, institutional and anti-Brahmin political movements get support from Christian and Islamic expansionist forces.In 1950s, a bishop from Madurai, in his book on church and Dravidian movement, called the movement a time bomb that they have developed to destroy Hinduism. In 2017, Mathimaran, a rabid anti-Hindu Dravidianist, who calls Subramania Bharati a 'Brahmin-Hindu supremacist' is a guest in Christian institutions. The remarkable consistency in supporting the worst forms of anti-Hindu racial hate ideologies by Christian institutions is telling.Soon after Tony Joseph wrote a distorted report in The Hindu on the Aryan invasion and migration question as being settled through genetics in favour of the invasion/migration hypothesis, WhatsApp messages started spreading in many groups. In one of the groups of my old collegemates, a friend shared a message she had received. It went like this: "The report of Tony Joseph had struck terror in the hearts of Brahmins in Tamil Nadu as it conclusively exposing them as aliens to this land. The report proves Tamils to be the original inhabitants of the land." And it ended with the usual call to share: "If you are born a true Tamil share this message with other Tamils and spread the awareness."

Who Stands Where In A Crowded Elevator And Why?She's in Finland now, getting her Ph.D. at the University of Jyvaskyla, but before that, when she was in Adelaide, Australia, she studied elevator behavior. Rebekah Rousi hung around two tall office towers in town, riding elevators up and down day after day, looking for patterns. When a bunch of people get into an elevator, she wondered, do they segregate in any predictable way? Do tall ones stand in the back? Do men stand in different places than women? Who looks where? She says she wasn't expecting or even predicting a particular configuration, but she found one.Over and over, she noticed that older "more senior men in particular seem to direct themselves towards the back of the elevator cabins."Younger men took up the middle ground.And in the front, facing the doors, backs to the guys, stood "women of all ages."She's not sure why. It wasn't segregation by height. It wasn't age, since older and younger women co-mingled. Clearly, the people in the back had the advantage of seeing everybody in the cabin, while people in the front had no idea who was behind them. Could there be a curiosity difference? A predatory difference?There was a second pattern, one that broke along gender lines. "Men," she wrote, "looked in the side mirrors and the door mirrors" to openly check out the other passengers, and/or themselves.Women didn't do that. "Women would watch the monitors and avoid eye contact with other users (unless in conversation)." They would only look at the mirrors (where they could check out the other passengers) when they were with other women. Eye-wise, the guys were roving, the ladies weren't."That's where I started thinking of power," Rebekah wrote me. The men who flocked to the back, who had a better view of their fellow passengers, were consistently older, more "senior" (I'm not sure how she knew that, but it's in her posted paper) and many of them "weren't concerned with 'getting caught' looking in the mirror." They gazed freely, suggesting a sense of privilege. Younger, less powerful men seemed to avoid that space, choosing a middle ground. The back of the box, (unlike the back of the bus in Alabama civil rights days) she decided, might be the elevator power zone.Or ...Perhaps a gender analysis is too easy. Power hierarchies in elevators, she wrote, "almost seemed too cliché." This could be about shyness. Bold people choose the back; shy people the front. Does that mean she thinks Australian women are more self-conscious than Australian men? She wouldn't go there, except to say, "I don't really want people to know how vain I am, so looking in the mirror (as a woman or not) when others are in the lift ... is highly avoided." By this analysis, the back of the elevator is the Vanity-Unleashed zone.Basically, she's still puzzled. A pattern shows up. But the explanation, she said, slipping into academic shyness, "awaits further analysis." Then she added, "I'd be really interested to hear what your listeners (she means you, you reading this) have to say about the issue."The always mischievous Latif Nasser (who is, I should mention, a regular contributor to Radiolab) read this post and sent me a video that describes a very different kind of elevator behavior. What happens if you step inside and everybody around you is doing something odd? Do you do it too?
Joe Gomez's return to first-team training has gone well, according to Jurgen Klopp, but he now must adjust to Liverpool's tactical outlook.Gomez spent a year on the sidelines with an ACL injury, and returned to the training field at Melwood in November.This saw him take part in a behind-closed-doors friendly victory over Accrington Stanley during the international break, providing Klopp with his first glimpse of Gomez's talents firsthand.Addressing Gomez's transition back into first-team football on Thursday morning, Klopp stressed that the 19-year-old must be given time to adapt."He's good. But there's absolutely no rush. We should stay cool," he said."I'm really happy to have him back. It was the first time I've seen him in a match live."It wasn't the most difficult game for a centre-half, but he did well."Training is good, now we have to work on the tactical things. For this he'll have match time, I don't know when we'll start this."He's a really physical talent, he's in really good shape but we want him for the long term. The education starts now."At 19, Gomez is in the perfect position for Klopp to mould him in his vision of a top-level centre-back, developing within the German's defensive system.Crucially, Klopp clearly sees Gomez turning out as a centre-back immediately, having filled in at left-back in his first months at the club under Brendan Rodgers, before injury struck.In the long term, Gomez swells Klopp's options at the back, joining Joel Matip, Dejan Lovren, Ragnar Klavan and Lucas Leiva, with Mamadou Sakho and Tiago Ilori left in the Liverpool U23s squad.He could be earmarked for his first outing in the new year, with Liverpool set to take part in the FA Cup third round in January, providing a solid test of his credentials.But Klopp won't be rushing Gomez back into his starting lineup, and with Matip and Lovren performing well as a duo, there is no need to.

Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry (R) on Wednesday called on FBI Director James Comey to resign over his recommendation not to press federal charges against Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonSenate panel subpoenas Roger Stone associate for Russia probe Webb: The new mob: Anti-American Dems Clinton to hold fundraiser for Menendez in NJ next month MORE for her use of a personal server while secretary of State.The demand from Perry, who suggested Comey might have a political motivation for going soft on Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, is a step across a line that no other prominent Republican has so far been willing to take.ADVERTISEMENT"For a man who prided himself on being a top law official in this country, I would suggest the man ought to resign," the two-time presidential candidate and "Dancing with the Stars" contestant said on Fox News."Comey has a lot of explaining to do, because those of us who understand what was going on here — the Clintons were clearly trying to hide this server," he said. "They did not want that information in, and for Comey to stand up and make excuses for Hillary is absolutely and totally unacceptable."I think [Comey] has some skin in the game here somewhere," Perry said. "To protect the Clintons at this particular juncture is an extraordinary failure on his part."Comey is three years into a 10-year term as head of the FBI and is not scheduled to leave office until 2023.Other prominent Republicans have notably refused to demand that Comey, who himself is a Republican, resign because of his recommendation in July that the Obama administration not file charges for Clinton's mishandling of classified information through her use of a personal email server. In an unprecedented public announcement, Comey claimed that Clinton and her aides had been "extremely careless" but did not show an intent to break the law.Top Republican lawmakers have questioned the department's judgment and demanded that the bureau release an unclassified version of its case file, which could be public as soon as this week.
Nate Parker brings the story of the 1831 slave rebellion led by Nat Turner to the screen in 'The Birth of a Nation.' (Photo: Elliot Davis, via Sundance Institute)UPDATE: The Birth of a Nation set a new sales record Tuesday at the Sundance Film Festival, netting a $17.5 million distribution deal from Fox Searchlight. According to Variety and The Hollywood Reporter, an overnight bidding war included escalating offers from The Weinstein Co., Netflix and Paramount.PARK CITY, Utah — The Birth of a Nation got a standing ovation, and it hadn't even started yet.Monday afternoon, the crowd rose to salute director/star/writer Nate Parker before it had seen a frame of his slavery drama, which centers its powerful story around a slave rebellion led by Nat Turner in 1831.The timing was nothing short of incredible. Diversity discussions had dominated Sundance Film Festival for five days, after the Academy Awards announced all-white acting nominees for the second year in a row.Then The Birth of a Nation arrived, starkly and thoughtfully excavating the roots of American racism."I made this film for one reason — in the hope of creating change agents," said Parker during the film's Q&A. "You can watch this film and see there are systems that were in place that were corrupt and corrupted people. And the legacy of that still lives with us."Born a slave in Virginia, Turner was taught to read as a child and grew up to become a preacher. He had an affable relationship with his master, Samuel (Armie Hammer), and was able to marry a slave, Cherry (Aja Naomi King). But slave abuse increased as plantation owners became more paranoid, including an increasingly savage Samuel.No longer able to justify their world through Bible verses, Turner ignites a slave rebellion, ultimately leading a 48-hour bloody attack."A labor of love pursued by Parker for seven years, the film vividly captures an assortment of slavery's brutalities while also underlining the religious underpinnings of Turner's justifications for his assaults on slaveholders," wrote The Hollywood Reporter.Birth is "certain to be the most widely discussed and rousingly received film in the U.S. dramatic competition at Sundance this year," Variety said.On stage, Parker described most films dealing with slavery in the South as "desperately sanitized." Despite success found by recent films 12 Years a Slave and Django Unchained, he spoke of an ongoing "resistance to dealing with this material. So when the script goes out, people read it, they say, 'People won't want to see this. Another slave movie? Haven't we seen those?' "So will rapturous applause at Sundance turn into a mega-million distribution deal? The Wrap reported that a bidding war had reached $16 million.Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1Vn4BXI

By Mike De SouzaOTTAWA — The federal government has acknowledged that it deliberately excluded data indicating a 20% increase in annual pollution from Canada's oilsands industry in 2009 from a recent 567-page report on climate change that it was required to submit to the United Nations.The numbers, uncovered by Postmedia News, were left out of the report, a national inventory on Canada's greenhouse gas pollution. It revealed a 6% drop in annual emissions for the entire economy from 2008 to 2009, but does not directly show the extent of pollution from the oilsands production, which is greater than the greenhouse gas emissions of all the cars driven on Canadian roads.The data also indicated that emissions per barrel of oil produced by the sector is increasing, despite claims made by the industry in an advertising campaign."The oilsands remain Canada's fastest-growing source of greenhouse gas pollution, and they're the subject of a huge amount of attention and scrutiny in Canada and internationally," said Clare Demerse, director of climate change at the Pembina Institute, an Alberta-based environmental research group. "So it's very disappointing to see Environment Canada publish a 500-page report that leaves out these critical numbers — especially when last year's edition included them."Overall, Environment Canada said that the oilsands industry was responsible for about 6.5% of Canada's annual greenhouse gas emissions in 2009, up from 5% in 2008. This also indicates a growth in emissions that is close to about 300% since 1990, which cancel out many reductions in pollution from other economic sectors.The report attributes the 6% decrease in Canada's overall emissions to the economic slowdown, but it also credits efforts by the Ontario government to reduce production of coal-fired electricity as a significant factor.Environment Canada provided the oilsands numbers in response to questions from Postmedia News about why it had omitted the information from its report after publishing more detailed data in previous years. A department spokesman explained that "some" of the information was still available in the latest report, which still meets Canada's reporting obligations under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change."The information is presented in this way to be consistent with UNFCCC reporting requirements, which are divided into broad, international sectors," wrote Mark Johnson in an email.He was not immediately able to answer questions about who made the decision in government to exclude the numbers from the oilsands or provide a detailed explanation about changes in emissions.An industry spokesman said it favoured more transparency from the government, suggesting that some of the figures may be misleading because of changes in methods used to identify and calculate emissions."It's just too bad you weren't able to get a hold of (Environment Canada) on this one, because here I am telling you my understanding of what's going on, but really it's best to hear directly from them," said Greg Stringham, vice-president of oilsands and markets at the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers. "We report the information to them, and they choose to pass it on — they must pass it on the UN. But then they choose how to disclose it and put it out there."Although Stringham said that the industry figures did not show any significant growth in emissions per barrel of oil produced, the full report noted an intensity increase of 14.5% from 2008 to 2009, "mainly the result of a new integrated mining and upgrading facility as well as a new integrated in-situ bitumen extraction and upgrading facility," that were not operating at "peak efficiencies."Emissions from a mining category, which includes oilsands extraction, saw a 371% increase in greenhouse gas pollution, according to the report. But other categories showed significant decreases due, in part, to the recession, but also because of changes in use of fuel and manufacturing operations.Environment Canada's report recognizes that climate change is occurring, mainly due to an increase in heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere. The objective of the UNFCCC is to stabilize these emissions in order to prevent dangerous changes to the climate.Critics have suggested the Harper government is deliberately trying to delay international action to fight climate change, following revelations, reported last fall by Postmedia News, that it had set up a partnership with the Alberta government, industry and several federal departments to fight pollution-reduction policies from other countries that target the oilsands through lobbying and public relations.Environment Minister Peter Kent has said the federal government is committed to reducing Canada's greenhouse gas emissions and will introduce its plan to regulate pollution from the oilsands within months. But he has also acknowledged that existing federal and provincial policies would still result in an increase in emissions over the next decade.Although the report was due in April, during the last election campaign, Canada was the last country to file its submission. Environment Canada even filed its submission after earthquake-stricken Japan, and was unable to explain in detail why its report was late.
The Underground Reservoir is a watery underground location in Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow. Most of the area can be accessible by gaining dominance over Skula's soul, Deep Seeker, which allows Soma to breathe and walk underwater. This stage is connected to the Castle Corridor, the Underground Cemetery, the Forbidden Area and the Arena.Contents show]Overview EditLike in the Floating Garden, the Underground Reservoir doesn't contain a boss, although a Big Golem can be encountered here. Many of the enemies here are water-borne. This area is the also the only place where the Sky Fish can be found.In one of the rooms, Soma will witness Graham Jones stabbing Yoko with a dagger. Arikado arrives at the scene and sends Soma after Graham, while he stays to take care of Yoko.Behind the big waterfall located in this stage, lies the entrance to the Forbidden Area. The trick to access it, is to equip Undine's soul (to be able to walk on the water's surface), and then equip and activate either the Curly's, Manticore's or Devil's soul to dash through the waterfall. The player will receive the Eversing armor along the way and find the door leading to the Forbidden Area on the other side.Gallery EditNotes EditBesides the Arena, the Underground Reservoir also connects to the Underground Cemetery. This last area is completely optional and not visiting it won't affect the game's continuity in any way.The Underground Reservoir also connects to the Forbidden Area, another optional location. It's advisable to visit this stage to obtain some very powerful items, like the Claimh Solais, one of the most powerful weapons in the game.Related locations Edit
The concerns center on the extent of foreign investment in a series of finance entities Mnuchin helped manage, including one based offshore in the Cayman Islands, aides tell CNN.It's an issue -- which Democratic aides and lawmakers say hasn't been addressed in subsequent follow-up questions in the weeks since -- that has raised concern about the extent of the influence those investors may hold, and the potential for conflicts of interest not unlike what has tailed Trump throughout his campaign. On its face, it echoes a prime point of contention for Democrats probing all of Trump's Cabinet picks, many of whom boast extensive private business and finance ties.But Mnuchin is slated to be the Trump Administration's top economic official, making those ties even more susceptible to potential conflicts, aides say -- the types of potential conflicts Mnuchin himself appeared to draw attention to inadvertently during his confirmation hearing.The focus has trained on a series of finance entities, all offshoots of the hedge fund run by Mnuchin up until he was selected as Trump's pick to be the country's economic point person.Foreign investorsAsked specifically about the investment makeup of the offshore entity during his hearing, Mnuchin repeatedly said it was created to provide opportunities for pension funds and non-profits to invest. There were also "a small number of foreign investors," Mnuchin told lawmakers.But the offshore entity and a series of other finance vehicles, some of which weren't originally disclosed by Mnuchin during the financial disclosure process, hold gross assets of more than $240 million, according to an SEC filing reviewed by CNN. Significant percentages of each were held by foreign investors, according to the filing, and one was 100 percent owned by foreign investors.JUST WATCHED Steve Mnuchin in 60 seconds Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Steve Mnuchin in 60 seconds 01:03Mnuchin's failure to initially disclose his relationship with the funds, along with his minimizing the scope of foreign investment in them during the hearing, has Democrats questioning whether it was part of a deliberate effort to steer them away."Misleading -- and that's the most charitable way you could say it," Sen. Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, said of Mnuchin's explanation during an interview. "You walked away thinking that almost the only people were churches and pensions (investing in those entities.)"One fund, Dune Capital International LTD., listed a gross asset value of $35.1 million in the 2013 disclosure. The disclosure, which identifies Mnuchin as one of three "Partners and Directors" of the Cayman Islands-based entity, claims 28% of the underlying fund ownership came from foreign investors, according to the SEC filing reviewed by CNN.A second US-based entity with $18.4 million in gross asset value, DE International Holdings LLC, is listed as 100% owned by "non-US persons," according to the SEC filing.Dune Entertainment Holdings LLC, which had a gross asset value of $124.8 million, listed 43% of its ownership as coming from foreign persons or entities. Two additional entities, Dune Entertainment International and Dune Entertainment LP, held in total nearly $62 million in gross asset value. The underlying assets were 100% and 43% beneficially owned by non-US persons, respectively. The portfolio played a role, at least in part, in the financing of Mnuchin's extensive financing of Hollywood projects."We're talking about foreign investors," Wyden said. "I don't have a lot of evidence right now that all these non-profits and pensions were interested in investing in movies."The foreign investment in the offshoots was entirely legal and isn't required to be disclosed. But Mnuchin's role in the entities was supposed to be disclosed to the committee. It wasn't. At least not until the Democratic investigative staff on the panel discovered the SEC document.Missing paperworkMnuchin, for his part, blamed the missing paperwork on the byzantine nature of the disclosure process. In a private interview with committee staff, aides said, Mnuchin acknowledged that his responses to the committee had not, as he had stated, been "true, accurate and complete." He twice was forced to revise his initial disclosure questionnaire. He stated his role in the entities was "inadvertently missed" during the disclosure process.Mnuchin's confirmation spokesman didn't respond to multiple requests for comment for this story. A White House official said the SEC filing, along with the rest of Mnuchin's extensive financial documentation, is now available for anyone to see."Mr. Mnuchin has followed all the necessary rules and regulations for his confirmation process," the official said in a statement. "All of this information is now publicly available and can be found by anyone who wishes to look at Mr. Mnuchin's financial records."Mnuchin, as it currently stands, is on track to be confirmed.
Military forces were deployed Sunday to help thousands of displaced people in Malaysia's northern state of Penang, officials said, as floodwater rose from more than 24 hours of incessant rain.At least 2,000 people had been evacuated and 80 percent of the state was hit by typhoonlike winds and heavy rain, chief minister Lim Guan Eng said in a statement.He said floodwater had risen to 3-4 meters (10-12 feet). Lim also warned in a Facebook post that more rain was expected and advised residents to stay at home.Deputy Prime Minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi said the National Security Council was coordinating with police and the military to assist flood victims after a request for assistance from Penang.Hundreds of trees were toppled and roads were submerged, leaving many areas practically paralyzed, Malaysian news agency Bernama reported. At least two people had been killed, it said."We remain fearful that there may still be untoward incidents because of the strong winds, the like of which have never been experienced before, and flash floods might recur," Lim told reporters in Penang, according to Bernama.Hundreds of people had been placed in temporary shelters after their homes were flooded or destroyed by the storm.

EA has confirmed that EA Sports UFC will run at 1080p and render at 30 frames per second on the Playstation 4 and Xbox One.In an interview with Gaming Bolt, EA Canada Creative Director, Brian Hayes, said that in previous projects, 60FPS "didn't have a hugely beneficial impact on gameplay." In fact, during focus-tests the team discovered that more players actually preferred the experience when the game ran at 30FPS with motion blur."As opposed to arbitrarily jumping back to 60 FPS for little discernible benefit, we decided to put those resources towards improving the visual presentation of the game in other ways," said Hayes.This comes after some outcry from gamers about the resolution of next-gen games.EA Sports UFC is currently expected to release on May 5, 2014 on Playstation 4 and Xbox One.Thanks, IGN.

I had some issues getting MathJax running smoothly alongside Markdown. The main issue stemmed from Markdown not providing a way to temporarily escape from its text transformations, so some L A TEX would get interpreted as Markdown.The only way I know of to prevent text transformations in Markdown is through the code block (prefix with 4+ spaces) and inline code (surround with ` ) features. However, both of those wrap the result in some HTML tag ( <pre> for the first, <code> for the second). I decided to use the inline code feature as the basis for inserting my math.I can insert math by typing, for example \`\\\( \\del \\cdot \\vec{B} = 0 \\\)\` . To make this work, I had to use the following MathJax configuration:MathJax.Hub.Config({ tex2jax: { skipTags: ['script', 'noscript', 'style', 'textarea', 'pre'] } });This prevents MathJax from skipping <code> tags. This could potentially cause issues if I used the sequences \\\( , \\\[ , or $$ in a normal (non-math) code block, but I think it's safe to say that those sequences won't show up in most of my code.The next step was to make sure MathJax <code> tags weren't actually styled like "normal" <code> tags. To do this, I added this to my MathJax configuration:MathJax.Hub.Queue(function() { // Fix <code> tags after MathJax finishes running. This is a // hack to overcome a shortcoming of Markdown. Discussion at // https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/issues/199 var all = MathJax.Hub.getAllJax(), i; for(i = 0; i < all.length; i += 1) { all[i].SourceElement().parentNode.className += ' has-jax'; } });with this in my CSS:
Death and the Lightning Bolt: Capital Punishment On The Ropes?Oct. 5, 2015 (Mimesis Law) — The jury returned its verdict and the judge, as judges pretty much all do, thanked them for their service. It is, he said, a difficult thing the county asked you to do, and it is grateful. Then he –Oh, wait, sorry. I left out the crime. It was ugly. Edgar Allen Poe stuff. Hoffner and his co-defendant Archie Dixon wanted to get hold of their buddy Chris Hammer's car. So they, with the assistance of Kristen Wilkerson (Dixon's girlfriend) . . . Feh. Don't make me tell it. Here's the official version, from the Ohio Supreme Court's opinion in Hoffner's appeal.In the early morning of September 22, Hoffner, Dixon, and Hammer went to Wilkerson's house. Once there, Hoffner and Dixon attacked Hammer. Hoffner restrained Hammer in a headlock while Dixon beat him. Hoffner tried to break Hammer's neck, and Dixon struck Hammer in the head with a wine bottle. Hoffner and Dixon then tied Hammer to a bunk-bed ladder, and Dixon went through Hammer's wallet, taking out his money, birth certificate, and Social Security card. Then Hoffner and Dixon discussed how they should dispose of Hammer's body. While Hammer remained tied to the bunk-bed ladder, Hoffner and Dixon left Wilkerson's house to dig a grave. Hoffner and Dixon returned to Wilkerson's house and they, along with Wilkerson, drove Hammer, blindfolded, to the gravesite in Hammer's car. Wilkerson stayed at the car while Hoffner and Dixon walked Hammer into the woods, where they permitted Hammer to smoke a cigarette. Then they gagged and again blindfolded Hammer, tied his hands and feet behind his back, grabbed him by his arms and legs, and dropped him into the grave, still alive. At one point, Hammer was able to remove the gag from his mouth and free one of his legs. Hoffner jumped into the grave and placed his foot over Hammer's mouth when Hammer yelled for help. Hoffner and Dixon then held Hammer down and covered him with dirt. After Hammer was completely buried, Hoffner and Dixon walked back and forth across the grave, packing down the dirt. Hoffner, Dixon, and Wilkerson then returned to Wilkerson's house in Hammer's car.OK, got that? Now, let's start again.The jury returned its verdict recommending that Tim Hoffner be executed, that he should be killed in the name of the people of the State of Ohio. And the judge, as judges pretty much all do after any jury trial, thanked them for their service. It is, he said, a difficult thing the county asked you to do, but a vitally important thing.Then he added that if any of the jurors needed therapy as a result of performing this service, the county would pay for it.There were three executions scheduled for last week.Kelly Gissendaner, on death row in Georgia, didn't kill anyone herself though she arranged for the 1997 murder of her husband, Douglas Gissander. Gregory Owen, the actual killer, was her lover at the time. He's doing life with a chance of parole. Whatever, whoever Gissendaner was then, she'd changed, showed remorse, provided support and counsel for other prisoners.Richard Glossip, on death row in Oklahoma, didn't kill anyone, either. It was Justin Sneed, serving a life sentence for the crime, who murdered Barry Van Treese, the owner of the motel where they both worked. The state's theory is that Glossip put Sneed up to it. The evidence supporting that claim, never strong, has pretty much completely unraveled.It's pretty clear that Alfredo Prieto, on death row in Virginia, did kill people himself, at least three and maybe half a dozen more that he's been linked to. He was on death row in California for the 1990 rape and murder of Yvette Woodruff when DNA tied him to killings in Virginia. He was extradited there, tried and again sentenced to be killed for the 1988 murders of Rachel Raver and Warren Fulton, III.[1] There's a fair chance that Prieto was mentally retarded. If so, his execution would be unconstitutional. The courts showed no interest in finding out.Gissendaner was to be executed Tuesday, Glossip Wednesday, Prieto Thursday. In each case the Pope, who'd made a point of calling for abolition of the death penalty when he spoke to Congress, made a specific request that the sentence be commuted. None of the sentences were.In each case, last minute litigation raised questions about what would happen. None of it staved off the executions. Lit
** FILE ** This July 16, 2004 file photo shows a gray wolf at the Wildlife Science Center in Forest Lake, Minn. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has filed a formal rule to remove gray wolves from the federal endangered list in Montana and Idaho while leaving them on the list in Wyoming. The agency filed the rule Wednesday, April 1, 2009, a day ahead of Thursday's publication of the delisting in the Federal Register. (AP Photo/Dawn Villella, file) (Photo: Dawn Villella, AP) Story Highlights Current Michigan law would allow for a wolf hunt in 2015.Proposals 14-1 and 14-2 will have no authority unless current law overturned via legal challenges.There will be no Michigan wolf hunt in 2014.Michigan voters who care whether the state should allow wolf hunting can have their say next week on the general election ballot.Sort of.Two proposals are on the Nov. 4 ballot that would either allow or prohibit state officials from holding another public hunting season for wolves. However, both proposals are essentially null and void -- regardless of how Michiganders vote on them -- because of action taken by the Legislature over the summer.Advocates on both sides of the issue want voters to have their say because the proposals could become important in the future.The proposals are the result of a complicated political chess match between those who oppose public wolf hunting and those who think it's an important tool for managing the former endangered species.To help you understand what you're voting on, we talked to the non-partisan Citizens Research Council to put together a primer on both proposals and why they may not matter until the future.The historyFirst, Wolves are native to Michigan but were nearly wiped out in the 19th and early 20th centuries by hunting and state-sanctioned bounties.In 1973, when Congress created the federal endangered species list, only six wolves were known to still exist in the Michigan wild.Under federal protection, wolf recovery was slow. But starting in 1989, the numbers began to rise in Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin, along with the hope that one day the animals would rebound enough to return to state control.To prepare for that possibility, the state convened a task force in 2005 to create a wolf management plan. Members of the task force included all stakeholders in wolf management, including biologists, representatives of Michigan's Indian tribes, sporting groups and wolf advocates.An overview of wolves in MichiganBy 2007, the wolf population in the Upper Peninsula topped 500 -- far exceeding the recovery benchmark of 100 set by the federal government, making the Great Lakes gray wolf one of the most successful recovery stories in the history of the endangered species list.At the same time, however, some Upper Peninsula residents began to complain that wolves were edging too close for comfort. Some farmers reported that wolves were killing livestock, and U.P. citizens reported wolves encroaching on towns and yards.In 2007, U.S. Fish and Wildlife sought to remove Great Lakes gray wolves from federal protection, but the Humane Society of the United States sued to delay the move. A federal court ruled in favor of the Humane Society, and wolves remained under endangered species protection for several more years.Finally, in 2012, Great Lakes gray wolves were removed from the endangered species list, putting the state of Michigan back in control of its wolf population.The conversation - or the debateMichigan's wolf management plan highlighted several methods for controlling the wolf population once they were removed from the endangered species list, including a potential public wolf hunt.Read the wolf management planIn December 2012, less than a year after wolves were removed from the list, the Legislature passed a bill designating wolves game animals. It was signed by Gov. Rick Snyder and became Public Act 520.The new law cleared the way for the Natural Resources Commission -- a seven-member body appointed by the governor -- to establish a hunting season for wolves.Proponents, including the state Department of Natural Resources, cited several reasons for backing wolf hunts. The DNR told lawmakers at a hearing that hunting would be one of many tools used by wildlife officials to control the wolf population."While the wolf population offers benefits, it also poses significant costs and concerns to some Michigan residents," Trevor VanDyke, the DNR's legislative liaison, told a Senate committee. "This would be another tool that would allow for proper management and implementation of the wolf management plan, and we think we'd use this as a tool to reduce those negative impacts and conflicts with livestock and humans."Opponents believed it was too soon to talk about a hunt. At the same hearing, wolf advocate Nancy Warren of the National Wolfwatcher Coalition questioned the scientific need for hunting as a management tool."There is no scientific evidence or research to support the need for
Lambdas are now available within Java 8 in the form of JSR-335 - Lambda Expressions for the JavaTM Programming LanguageUPDATE: JDK8 has now been released which contains project lambda. It's worth grabbing a copy of Java 8 in Action currently still MEAP.Have a read of Brian Goetz articles relating to lambdas for a decent understanding of how lambdas are implemented within JDK8 while also gaining an understanding of streams, internal iteration, short-circuiting and constructor references.. Also check out the JSR's above to get further examples.I've written a blog on some of the advantages of using lambdas in JDK8 called The Power of the Arrow, also NetBeans 8 has great support for converting constructs to JDK8 which I've also blogged about Migrating to JDK 8 with NetBeans.
[Updated 4/2/2007 - follow-up article here] For the last three years, I've been meaning to put to rest once and for all the urban legends and myths on wireless LAN security. Every time I write an article or blog on wireless LAN security, someone has to come along and regurgitate one of these myths. If that weren't bad enough, many "so called" security experts propagated these myths through speaking engagements and publications and many continue to this day. Many wireless LAN equipment makers continue to recommend many of these schemes to this day. One would think that the fact that none of these schemes made it in to the official IEEE 802.11i security standard would give a clue to their effectiveness, but time and time again that theory is proven wrong. To help you avoid the these schemes, I've created the following list of the six dumbest ways to secure your wireless LAN.Wireless LAN security hall of shameMAC filtering: This is like handing a security guard a pad of paper with a list of names. Then when someone comes up to the door and wants entry, the security guard looks at the person's name tag and compares it to his list of names and determines whether to open the door or not. Do you see a problem here? All someone needs to do is watch an authorized person go in and forge a name tag with that person's name. The comparison to a wireless LAN here is that the name tag is the MAC address. The MAC address is just a 12 digit long HEX number that can be viewed in clear text with a sniffer. A sniffer to a hacker is like a hammer to a carpenter except the sniffer is free. Once the MAC address is seen in the clear, it takes about 10 seconds to cut-paste a legitimate MAC address in to the wireless Ethernet adapter settings and the whole scheme is defeated. MAC filtering is absolutely worthless since it is one of the easiest schemes to attack. The shocking thing is that so many large organizations still waste the time to implement these things. The bottom line is, MAC filtering takes the most effort to manage with zero ROI (return on investment) in terms of security gain.SSID hiding: There is no such thing as "SSID hiding". You're only hiding SSID beaconing on the Access Point. There are 4 other mechanisms that also broadcast the SSID over the 2.4 or 5 GHz spectrum. The 4 mechanisms are; probe requests, probe responses, association requests, and re-association requests. Essentially, youre talking about hiding 1 of 5 SSID broadcast mechanisms. Nothing is hidden and all youve achieved is cause problems for Wi-Fi roaming when a client jumps from AP to AP. Hidden SSIDs also makes wireless LANs less user friendly. You dont need to take my word for it. Just ask Robert Moskowitz who is the Senior Technical Director of ICSA Labs in his white paper Debunking the myth of SSID hiding.LEAP authentication: The use of Cisco LEAP authentication continues to be the single biggest mistake that corporations make with their wireless LAN because they leave themselves wide open to attack. Cisco still tells their customers that LEAP is fine so long as strong passwords are used. The problem is that strong passwords are an impossibility for humans to deal with. If you doubt this, try a password audit of all the users in your organization and see how long it takes to crack 99% of all passwords. 99% of organizations will flunk any password audit for most of their users within hours. Any attempt to enforce strong passwords will result in passwords written on sticky notes. Since Joshua Wright released a toolthat can crackLEAP with lighting speed, Cisco was forced to come out with a better alternative to LEAP and they came up with an upgradeto LEAP calledEAP-FAST. Unfortunately, EAP-FAST still falls short in security with its default installation. Although Cisco makes LEAP and EAP-FAST freely available to partners for the client end, the same is not true for Access Points.LEAP and EAP-FAST are essentially two proprietary protocolsthat Cisco employs as a strategy to monopolize the Access Point market. There are open standards based EAP mechanisms like EAP-TLS, EAP-TTLS, and PEAP which are all much more secure than either LEAP or EAP-FAST and they work on all Access Points and client adapters, not just Cisco. Cisco does support open standard EAPs just like everyone else so you should always use open EAP standards to get better security and avoid the hardware lock-in.Disable DHCP: This is much more of waste of time than it is a security break. DHCP allows the automatic assignment of IP addresses and other configurations. Disabling DHCP has zero security value and just wastes time. It would take a hacker about 10 seconds to figure out the IP scheme of any network and simply assign their own IP address. Anyone who tells you that
A LOT has changed since our last update.. Anthony got MARRIED to the love of his life (we love her to death)! Watch their beautiful wedding video here:vimeo.com/112371211We are fundraising money, because Anthony is not working anymore & is taking care of his health & spending time with family full time. On average, ALS patient care can be upwards of $200K a year. Although Anthony is currently not at that point of dependency, ALS only gets worse & is a progressive disease...we know it too well. This is why we're attempting to prepare for a financially stress free life.Anthony will ultimately need a wheelchair accessible home... he will need help paying for health insurance, future medical expenses, food, phone, car, rent, basic living costs... etc and hopefully a little room to enjoy his healthier years...We sincerely appreciate any and all support. We love each and every one of you! Words can not describe how incredibly grateful our family is for your support... today and always.How do I contact Anthony?Letters of encouragement:31915 Rancho California Road, Suite 200-400, Temecula CA, 92591Instagram - http://www.instagram.com/carbajalphoto twitter: @carbajalphotoemail: Anthony@AnthonyCarbajal.comALS research organization we support:ALS Therapy Development Institute - www.ALS.net ...............................................................................................................Anthony Carbajal is an AMAZING human being.Anthony is kind-hearted, generous and an inspiration to us all. He radiates joy, love and compassion. He loves to laugh, takes the most gorgeous photographs, has mad skateboarding skills, plays the acoustic guitar and is an artist at heart. He is LOVED by all, and he is a miraculous gift to our family and everyone else who knows him.On Monday, January 27th, Anthony received the devastating news that he has ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. ALS runs in the family. His grandmother died from it, and his mother currently has it. Ironically, Anthony had been helping to take care of his mother and is a dedicated advocate and voice in the fight to cure ALS when this all happened. In his own words:"During the past six months, my hands became noticeably weaker, and both arms began twitching constantly. My last few weddings, I had difficulties changing my camera settings, because my hands were so weak. I tried to convince myself it was carpal tunnel, even though I knew these were the same symptoms my mother and grandmother experienced before they were diagnosed with ALS. I finally got health insurance and was seen by a neurologist. I was diagnosed soon after."To attempt to preserve the muscle that's left in his hands and arms, he can no longer work as a wedding photographer. The equipment is too heavy, and the days are too long. Once muscle is lost, it cannot be regained, and the risk is not worth it. He is liquidating his camera equipment to raise funds to pay for his medical insurance and costs, as well as his business expenses and taxes that he currently owes, but it will not be enough since he can no longer work... So, we are fundraising for him. All contributions go directly into Anthony's PayPal account, and you do not need a PayPal account to contribute. When the payment request comes up, you have the option to use PayPal or credit card.Share & contribute through this website. - or –Mail a check to his address:31915 Rancho California Road, Suite 200-400, Temecula CA, 92591Spread the word about ALS and/or pray for him.Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and the spinal cord. Motor neurons reach from the brain to the spinal cord and from the spinal cord to the muscles throughout the body. The progressive degeneration of the motor neurons in ALS eventually leads to their death. When the motor neurons die, the ability of the brain to initiate and control muscle movement is lost. With voluntary muscle action progressively affected, patients in the later stages of the disease may become totally paralyzed.

Just when you think you've heard it all, a Kansas man finds an unexpected way to get out of his crumbling marriage.Lawrence Ripple, 70, pleaded guilty on Monday to charges related to a September bank robbery. According to court documents, Ripple entered the bank and handed the teller a note demanding money and saying that he had a gun.But after the bank teller handed over several thousand dollars in cash, Ripple didn't flee the scene -- he sat down and waited for police to arrive and arrest him.An FBI agent revealed in court that Ripple had argued with his wife earlier, telling her that he'd rather be in jail than with her. Authorities say he wrote her a note saying he "no longer wanted to be in that situation."Ripple faces up to 20 years in federal prison and a fine of up to $250,000.The Kansas City Star reports that Ripple's wife accompanied him to court Monday.

2) Budget a LOT of time. I'm sure experienced swatchers can do this more quickly, but it took me roughly 30 - 45 minutes per colour to do the full swatching/clean up/picture editing/posting on the blog. For the 11 colours I did, I spent about 4 hours on polish, and 2 - 3 hours on photo editing and posting. That's a LOT of work!3) Sunlight is mandatory for great colour! Unless you have a professional photo studio, which I do not. I use a simple point and shoot camera, some white paper to provide a clean background, and the sun.4) Keep an eye on the weather forecast! Living in the north, I'm at a serious disadvantage in winter when it comes to the window I have for swatching. At this time of year, I have a few hours of good strong sunlight that will let me take nice pictures, so I took advantage of every minute. Once summer rolls around, I'm sure the advantage will skew in my favour - I look forward to it!5) Keep a glass of water nearby. Between the polish fumes and acetone fumes, your throat will get scratchy and dry. This leads directly to...6) Work in a well-ventilated area to reduce exposure to noxious fumes. Acetone is NOT a fun thing to breathe in!7) Do the colours you're working with really need a base coat? If it doesn't stain, then don't waste your time. And don't assume that dark colours will stain while light colours won't - ManGlaze's Fuck off and Dye is a hot pink that will stain your nailbeds as soon as you put it on, while the Deborah Lippmann Edge of Glory black creme I had on today didn't stain at all with no base coat through several applications. Test and be sure!8)  Be expedient. I've yet to take a single picture that shows my thumb or my right hand, so now I just polish the four fingers on my left hand. This saves a lot of time and clean up!9) Rushing your polish job will just end in misery later when you try and fix your mistakes in Photoshop. 10) On the topic of Photoshop, learn what's an easy post-processing fix, and what's just an invitation to torture. Ding your creme polish a bit? Not a big deal - that can be quickly and easily fixed in Photoshop. Got polish along your cuticle? You're gonna pull your hair out trying to fix it.11) A small cosmetic brush and a bottle of pure acetone are your best friends for cleaning up your manicure. Take your time and gently brush away any mistakes along your cuticle, edges, and sides of your fingers. The pure acetone will just eat away the polish, so be careful! 12) Every second you spend cleaning up your nails before you take a picture means minutes saved afterwards.13) Even if you don't see the mess on your nails, your camera will. A high resolution macro shot in sunlight is extremely unforgiving - every speck of stray polish, every bit of dry skin, every stray piece of pet fur will show up.14) Just because you can't see it, doesn't mean it's not there. Even if you can't see a mess on your cuticles, run the brush over them anyway because the camera will.15) Think you're in the safe from camera mistakes with your base and top coat because they're clear? Think again. The macro setting and the sun will reveal any clear polish on your cuticles or fingers, making them look uneven and messy. Make sure to swipe the brush along your cuticles after your topcoat too!16) When you finish cleaning up your cuticles with the brush, take a cotton pad and wipe down your fingertip and around your nail. This will clean up any polish that dripped with the acetone down your skin and collected in any lines on your fingers. Trust me, it's there. You'll be amazed what comes off on that cotton pad!17) After all that acetone, your nails and fingers are going to be super dry. Give them a good slather of cuticle oil afterwards to help smooth things over.18) After your nails are nicely cleaned up, take your pictures against a clean white background. Plain old printer paper will work fine for this.19) Take a LOT of pictures from a ton of angles! You never know what you're going to capture by moving the camera a bit. You can sort out the good from the bad when you're in PhotoshopThat's it for now! I'm sure I'll have more to share as I continue learning how to swatch and photograph my manicures :)
If you thought the Raiders cutting Rolando McClain was good news, you're going to love this. As it turns out, according to Joel Corry of the National Football Post, there was language in McClain's contract that voided all remaining guaranteed money should he be suspended for conduct.Last season he was indeed suspended for two games for conduct detrimental to the team which means his remaining $3.635 million in previously guaranteed money is now voided. This brings his dead money against the cap from its previously assumed figure of $10.895 million down to $7.26 million - just $585k more than his 2013 cap hit would have been had he remained on the roster.Basically what this means is it the cost of cutting him is negligible compared to keeping him. But keeping him would have been far more costly to the team dynamic and you can't put a price on that. That said, actual monetary value is nice as well. In this case, for Rolando McClain, it was literally payback time.McClain officially became a free agent on Monday at 1pm Pacific time and the Raiders immediately began putting that $3.635 million to good use. In about 24 hours time, they signed two outside free agents - CB Mike Jenkins and S Usama Young -- and re-signed two of their own free agents - DE Andre Carter and CB Joselio Hanson. They are also believed to have tendered contracts to their remaining Exclusive Rights Free Agents - CB Brandian Ross, RB Jeremy Stewart, and OL Alex Parsons.The contract figures of the newly signed free agents are not yet known, so it is hard to know the Raiders' exact cap number at this instant. However, the most recent figure before the flurry of signings on Monday and Tuesday at about $8 million under the salary cap.You can figure the four signings carry a total cap hit between $3 million and $4 million which would leave the team with enough room to sign one or perhaps two more low cost free agents. If they do add a player or more than one, it would happen this week as off-season workouts begin next Monday. Free Agent quarterback Seneca Wallace is visiting on Wednesday and there is a decent chance the Raiders attempt to sign him to a minimum deal which would give the team three quarterbacks.The cap room will open up again for the Raiders once June 1rolls around and the a large portion of Michael Huff's cap hit is distributed to 2014. We can expect more additions at that time.Follow @LeviDamien

Tippi Hedren, Noel Marshall and their daughter Melanie Griffith are not just a unique family for having made significant contributions to the cinema (Tippi was the star of the movie "The Birds" by Alfred Hitchcock, and Marshall was executive producer of "The Exorcist"). In fact, the family spent much of their life living on a farm in California where they shared not only the garden, but the living room and even the bed with a real lion. This crazy experiment was undertaken in order to film the catastrophic movie that was 'Roar' (1981). It was in production for 11 years and cost $17 million.#1 'Roar'During a trip to Africa in the 70's, the family came across an abandoned house that had been overtaken by lions. This was, ultimately, the exact moment they decided they wanted to create a movie based on this scene. The main idea of the movie was to educate the world about the danger of the extinction of lions, tigers and many other wild beasts. But first, they needed to learn how to live with them.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENT
Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.Washington lawmakers are demanding an accounting of how many airport security badges have been lost or stolen around the country as an NBC News investigation reveals the problem may be bigger than originally thought."Clearly there are an awful lot of things falling through the cracks and there's just no room for error when it comes to this issue. We need answers. They're not providing them," said Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.), who chairs the Transportation Committee.Thune and two other committee members have sent a letter to the Transportation Security Administration seeking more information.As NBCDFW reported in March, more than 1,400 of the badges — which allow employees to access secure areas like runways and boarding gates — went missing at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport over approximately two years.Now, the station, in partnership with NBC San Diego, has learned that more than 270 badges went missing at the San Diego International Airport in the last two years.And some of those wayward badges were not reported for weeks or months — meaning they were not quickly deactivated.Workers are supposed to report a missing badge within 24 hours, and the San Diego airport authority said it plans to do more to ensure that rule is followed.The TSA said many airports have extra layers of security so workers need a code or handprint to get in, not just an ID badge. The agency said it's also working to step up background checks and random searches of workers who have ID badges nationwide.IN-DEPTH
By Robert MullinCAISO last week provided an explanation of its decision to increase regulation requirements in response to the growing variability on its system.The ISO's Department of Market Monitoring last month called attention to the sharp rise in costs from the requirements, prompting the California Energy Commission to ask the ISO to justify the move. (See CAISO Regulation Costs Quadruple as Price, Procurement Jump.)During a Market Performance and Planning Forum last week, CAISO said it doubled its frequency regulation service requirement from late February to mid-June in response to recurring short-term generation forecasting errors stemming from variable wind and solar resources during late winter and spring.The forecasting problem is mostly isolated to spring, when high renewable output often coincides with periods of low loads in California. At the same time, weather patterns tend to be more erratic, often making it especially difficult to predict renewable output on a moment-to-moment basis.Regulation prices more than doubled shortly after the ISO increased its daily regulation procurement from 400 MW or less to as much as 800 MW in late February. Daily payments to regulation service providers surged from $100,000 to more than $400,000, the ISO's Monitor found last month.The ISO rolled back regulation requirements to previous levels for summer because of more predictable weather patterns.Further compounding the spring forecasting issue is the increasing adoption of residential rooftop solar, which is subject to the same variability as utility-scale projects. The ISO estimates it has nearly 5,000 MW in rooftop solar in its balancing area, with new installations added daily. Variability in behind-the-meter rooftop output complicates matters by causing loads to skew from forecasts depending on whether the sun is shining.The problem "happens more in the off-season — with more of the clouds coming in," said Amber Motley, CAISO short-term forecasting manager. "Timing and forecasting of [generation] ramps are very difficult. Forecasting cloud coverage is difficult."Variable wind production can also be a factor, with cold fronts making it difficult to predict the timing of wind ramps and changes in wind direction causing intermittency.Clyde Loutan, ISO senior advisor for renewable energy integration, said weather changes can occur too quickly to incorporate revised forecasts into the real-time market run. He also pointed out that forecasting errors are not covered under the ISO's real-time contingency dispatch process, which sets aside generation to allow the system to recover from major disturbances."So you have to rely on regulation," Loutan said."Seems like it's more a failure of the forecast," said Dan Williams, CAISO markets analyst at Portland General Electric. "And that should be changed by changing the market rather than rolling it into regulation."Loutan countered that he didn't know of any forecaster that could reflect the intermittency in the five-minute market."When you think about how these markets were designed, they were really designed for conventional units," he said.Loutan also pointed to a clear financial incentive driving the ISO's increased requirement."Back in January we had some pretty bad days when we didn't control the frequency well enough," he said. "For 11 hours, we had a hard time controlling the system. We found out that we were running out of regulation."If the condition had persisted longer than 30 consecutive minutes, the ISO would have been subject to as much as $1 million in NERC penalties, he said.Carolyn Kehrein, principal consultant for the Energy Users Forum, suggested that increased regulation costs should be allocated to intermittent resources if the forecasting problem continued and the ISO didn't develop new tools to deal with it. She said increased costs for intermittency should encourage the "right kind" of renewable development, such as geothermal.Wei Zhou, senior project manager with Southern California Edison, agreed with applying the cost-causation principle to the problem."This is something that we're looking at long-term," said Loutan, referring to the forecasting issue at large. "But for now we just wanted to explain why we increased our regulation procurement."
Panhandling Guide No.13 (2002) by Michael S. ScottThe Problem of PanhandlingThis guide addresses the problem of panhandling.† It also covers nearly equivalent conduct in which, in exchange for donations, people perform nominal labor such as squeegeeing (cleaning) the windshields of cars stopped in traffic, holding car doors open, saving parking spaces, guarding parked cars, buying subway tokens, and carrying luggage or groceries.The guide begins by describing the panhandling problem and reviewing factors that contribute to it. It then identifies a series of questions that might help you in analyzing your local problem. Finally, it reviews responses to the problem, and what is known about those responses from evaluative research and police practice.Generally, there are two types of panhandling: passive and aggressive. Passive panhandling is soliciting without threat or menace, often without any words exchanged at all—just a cup or a hand held out. Aggressive panhandling is soliciting coercively, with actual or implied threats, or menacing actions. If a panhandler uses physical force or extremely aggressive actions, the panhandling may constitute robbery.Isolated incidents of passive panhandling are usually a low police priority.1 In many jurisdictions, panhandling is not even illegal. Even where it is illegal, police usually tolerate passive panhandling, for both legal and practical reasons.2 Courts in some jurisdictions have ruled that passive panhandling is constitutionally protected activity. Police can reasonably conclude that, absent citizen complaints, their time is better spent addressing more serious problems. Whether panhandling and other forms of street disorder cause or contribute to more serious crime—the broken windows thesis—is hotly debated, but the debate is as yet unsettled.3 Panhandling becomes a higher police priority when it becomes aggressive or so pervasive that its cumulative effect, even when done passively, is to make passersby apprehensive.4 Panhandling is of greater concern to merchants who worry that their customers will be discouraged from patronizing their business. Merchants are most likely to call police when panhandling disrupts their commerce.5,†Police must also be concerned with the welfare of panhandlers who are vulnerable to physical and verbal assault by other panhandlers, street robbers†† or passersby who react violently to being panhandled.6 Panhandlers often claim certain spots as their own territory, and disputes and fights over territory are not uncommon.7Broadly speaking, public policy perspectives on panhandling are of two types—the sympathetic view and the unsympathetic view. The sympathetic view, commonly but not unanimously held by civil libertarians and homeless advocates, is that panhandling is essential to destitute people's survival, and should not be regulated by police.8 Some even view panhandling as a poignant expression of the plight of the needy, and an opportunity for the more fortunate to help.9 The unsympathetic view is that panhandling is a blight that contributes to further community disorder and crime, as well as to panhandlers' degradation and deterioration as their underlying problems go unaddressed.10 Those holding this view believe panhandling should be heavily regulated by police.People's opinions about panhandling are rooted in deeply held beliefs about individual liberty, public order and socialresponsibility. Their opinions are also shaped by their actual exposure to panhandling—the more people are panhandled, the less sympathetic they are toward panhandlers.11 While begging is discouraged on most philosophical grounds and by most major religions, many people feel torn about whether to give money to panhandlers.12 Some people tolerate all sorts of street disorder, while others are genuinely frightened by it. This tension between opposing viewpoints will undoubtedly always exist. This guide takes a more neutral stance: without passing judgment on the degree of sympathy owed to panhandlers, it recognizes that police will always be under some pressure to control panhandling, and that there are effective and fair ways to do so.Related ProblemsPanhandling and its variants are only one form of disorderly street conduct and street crime about which police areconcerned. Other forms—not directly addressed in this guide—include:disorderly conduct of day laborers;disorderly conduct of public inebriates (e.g., public intoxication, public drinking, public urination and defecation, harassment, intimidation, and passing out in public places);disorderly conduct of transients/homeless (e.g., public camping, public urination and defecation, and sleeping on sidewalks and benches, and in public libraries);disorderly youth in public places;harassment (usually sexual) of female pedestrians;pickpocketing;purse snatchings;robbery at automated teller machines (ATMs);trash picking (for
GOREILLAMAN CAWK COMMANDER - "Don't hate her. But I had a bad person interaction with her so im not a fan. Hate is a strong word tho" - want to elaborate bro?Sure. It was about idk a year maybe 2 ago and I was having a discussion with uncle creepy on Twitter of all places about followers. Basically he was wanting more and I have a decent amount so I said I would tell mine to follow him. She replied to my message with something along the lines of doubt this guy can help he probably buys his followers then called me pathetic. It was just an odd thing for a professional athlete and champion to say to someone on social media especially to someone who wasn't talking to her. But the interesting part was when I told her I don't buy followers I congratulated her on her win (she had just won the invitca title a few days prior) her tone completely changed and she was super friendly. I don't hate her because the situation is so petty and not important to anyone's life but I'm not rooting for her so I guess it upset me enough to sway me against her like that lol
Microsoft's Office team has been on a roll. In the few past months, it's been busy creating the upcoming Office 2016 for Windows, as well as new universal apps for Windows 10 that work on mobile devices just as well as the desktop. It turns out Mac users, however, will be the first to see what the team has up its sleeve this year.Microsoft has just released a preview of Office 2016 for Mac, which includes updated versions of Word, Excel PowerPoint, OneNote and Outlook. All of these are now optimized for retina displays, support full-screen views and have revamped ribbon interfaces.As you'd expect, they're also connected to the cloud for accessing your files anywhere. Curiously, there's only support for Microsoft services at the moment: OneDrive, OneDrive for Business and SharePoint.Microsoft announced a partnership with Dropbox on its mobile Office apps last month, and recently began adding support for other platforms too, so we wouldn't be surprised if these made their way into Office for Mac by the time the full product is released.Of course, there are a ton of new app-specific features as well.Word's design tab helps manage layouts, colors and fonts throughout a document, while a navigation pane similar to the one in PowerPoint makes it easy to find the pages you're looking for. Comments are now threaded too, which should make editing sessions a lot less of a pain.Excel features improvements to charts, graphs, keyboard shortcuts and data entry, including a formula builder and autocomplete. New functions added in Excel 2013 for Windows helps make the app more powerful, while assuring your calculations will work across platforms.For users working on more complicated statistics, the Analysis ToolPak introduces several statistical functions like moving averages and exponential smoothing.PowerPoint is introducing a nifty 'Presenter View' feature, which basically works as a hub only the speaker can see; it can display your next slides, a timer and notes, while your audience only sees the current slide. There's also a new animation pane and slide transitions to add some pizzazz.The new Outlook is basically an update to what Microsoft introduced back in October, which isn't a bad thing. There's an improved conversation view that automatically threads your conversations, and message previews now show you the first sentence of an email in addition to the subject line.Finally, Microsoft has also been pushing out updates to OneNote recently, all of which are included in Office 2016. You can now organize your notes more effectively with tags, and use optical character recognition (OCR) to parse text from images and handwriting.Although Microsoft pushes out small updates to its Office for Mac intermittently, the last time the apps saw a full revamp was 2011. There isn't an exact launch date for the final version of the productivity suite, but the company says to expect it sometime this summer.If you want to give it a try, head on over to Microsoft's Office for Mac page – you can install it alongside your older version of Office if you want. Just keep in mind you'll have to be running OS X Yosemite to get it installed.➤ Office for Mac 2016Read next: Forget MVPs, startups need to create minimum 'lovable' products

After all, President Obama is no pushover. In 2013, he decided not to implement his "red line" threat to use force if Syria used chemical weapons again, overruling his secretaries of state and defense. On an earlier occasion, he overruled his entire national security team's proposal to arm and train the Syrian opposition. For better or worse, American intervention in Libya was Mr. Obama's decision, not Mrs. Clinton's. It is called the Obama administration for a reason.Second, as to why Libya deteriorated so dramatically after Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi's fall, Mrs. Clinton worked as hard as anyone to stabilize the country. But in doing so, she was operating pursuant to restrictions imposed by the president, who established strict limits on the United States' military role. The president has come to regret limiting the American contribution to certain air assets and other unique capabilities needed at the outset of the air campaign. In an interview with Thomas L. Friedman, he said the lesson he learned in Libya is "the need to come in full force if you're going to do this"and that "there has to be a much more aggressive effort to rebuild societies."Third, the report's biggest flaw is the scant attention given to the consequences of inaction back in 2011 and the plausible policy alternatives at the time. Knowing Colonel Qaddafi's track record as a sponsor of terrorism and a brutal dictator (psychopath?), Western leaders had good reason to believe the regime's threats of mass murder.Five years later, in Syria we also have the clearest possible evidence of what happens when a brutal Arab dictator is left unchecked during a democratic uprising. The consequences of inaction there have been immense, with hundreds of thousands of innocent men, women and children killed and refugees overwhelming the region and destabilizing Europe.The truth is there were not a lot of options back in 2011. Once the Libyan uprising led to the Qaddafi crackdown, civil war became inevitable. The West did prevent that war from becoming a mass slaughter, which should be a source of satisfaction. The Libyan people certainly don't blame America for the chaos they are living through. So why are the administration's critics doing so?
Sydney architect Rana Abboud won a NAWIC Scholarship in 2013 to investigate the opportunities and obstacles for Augmented Reality in the practice of architecture. She reports for ArchitectureAU on her key research findings.Augmented Reality's potential for Architecture is huge. "AR" is any system that overlays, or 'augments,' the real world with digital information that seemingly co-exists. Today's AR applications hint at a future to come: virtual furniture may be overlaid in real time to check its size and appearance in a room; 'see-through' walls on a construction site allow builders to view pipes and mechanical ducting behind; and overlays of past and future buildings render the city a canvas for virtual data. As tech giants race to release wearable interfaces for ever greater augmentation of the physical world, the number of worldwide users consuming AR via portable media devices is expected to exceed 1 billion users by 2020.As recipient of the 2013 International Women's Day Scholarship awarded by the National Association of Women in Construction (NAWIC), I recently researched the Opportunities and Obstacles for Augmented Reality across key phases of architectural practice. My focus was on a subset of AR known as Mobile Augmented Reality (MAR), which applies the concept of AR in truly mobile settings, away from special-purpose work areas.With MAR, displays are portable, and range from smartphones, to tablets, to wearable Head-Mounted Displays (HMDs). My intent was to identify high-level uses for Mobile AR across key architectural phases, and explain the challenges currently preventing MAR's uptake by the Australian architecture profession. My focus question was: "What are the opportunities and obstacles for mobile AR in key phases of architectural practice – namely, design, construction, and post-completion?"Gartner's Hype Cycle with Augmented Reality overlay.The AR trail took me on a study tour across North America, Europe, and Oceania. With the support of NAWIC and Architectus, I met with AEC industry leaders, AR developers, software researchers, academics, and pioneers of AR in construction applications worldwide. I discovered that Augmented Reality had reached the pinnacle of news media hype in 2011, and that its users were now hurtling towards the 'Trough of Disillusionment.' I tried on Head-Mounted Displays, and found out the Google Glass was not true AR. I also uncovered a broad spectrum of Use Cases and AR prototypes relevant to architecture.Opportunities: DesignAR can overlay a real site with a virtual design at full-scale. A growing number of AR developers and visualisation providers now offer AR platforms that enable 'walking tours' of a virtual building, from early design through to construction. Those from backgrounds outside the construction industry often struggle to decode technical planning documents, or interpret 2-D drawings to understand their 3-D implications. MAR applications promise to bypass such 'coding' and 'translation' models of spatial communication, and more intuitively convey the intended appearance, scale, and features of a proposed design.By using virtual components to stand in for physical objects, AR can save on the fabrication and material costs of real-world prototypes.AR platforms can also isolate individual elements within a spatial scheme for presentation at full scale. By using virtual components to stand in for physical objects, AR can save on the fabrication and material costs of real-world prototypes. Such applications are useful in clash detection, to visually detect overlaps between proposed virtual content and real world elements. Today's commercial applications in this area are limited to mass-manufactured objects, whose modular nature provides a compelling business case for AR platforms that communicate scale.MAR platforms can also augment physical models and drawings with unlimited virtual content. The most common augmentation of presentation media today is when a paper drawing, such as a 2D plan, becomes the marker for a 3D model overlay. But the value-add of AR is in communicating information that other media cannot, such as 4D content (information with a time component). Overlays need not be limited to visual applications either, as AR can draw on other senses to communicate elements of a scheme, such as the acoustics within a space.With AR, multiple users may share the same physical space and perceive the 'spatial presence' of a digital object, making it an ideal medium for collaborative problem solving.But while the most familiar uses in design today are in design visualisation, (such as with the Augmented Australia 1914-2014 exhibition planned for Venice), AR will increasingly inform the design process itself. With AR, multiple users may share the same physical space and perceive the 'spatial presence' of a digital object, making it an ideal medium for collaborative problem solving. MAR applications promise to bring the designer into more direct contact with the building site, allowing building designers to quickly contextualise and review their designs in situ.Opportunities: Construction

It's Getting Better All The TimeWe've all been expecting a techno dystopia, a world shattered by climate change and deadened by social media. But what if the reverse is true?2833 viewsCopy and paste the embed code on your website, blog post or article.

I saw where technology was headed and I was upset, not amazed. But something is changing and I want to tell you about it."Yearly reminder: unless you're over 60, you weren't promised flying cars. You were promised an oppressive cyberpunk dystopia. Here you go," wrote Kyle Marquis in February 2015. For most of my life Marquis' words rang true. I saw the future as a slide into darkness, all Blade Runner and dirty bombs. But we are living in an era of unprecedented access to information and increasingly improved access to the resources needed to build a better world. All is not peaches and cream - yet - but I argue it will get there.This book is an examination of everything, from Bitcoin to VR, that will change our lives for the better. I will interview thinkers, makers, and doers and I'll speak to people from all walks of life. I want to tell a story in which we thrive instead of just survive.The PlanI intend to meet and interview the people doing the most good in the tech world - and some of the folks who might not be doing the most good. I intend to explore health, environment, and social interaction and bring in research from around the world on how technology is impacting us. I will write it in a conversational style - this isn't a boring term paper - and I'll treat it like my treatise on our better tomorrow.Why do I want to this? Because I owe it to my family and to promise them that things are going to be OK. I think things will become drastically different over the next decade and the next century but I disagree that the future is a downward slope. Entropy exists but the human will is stronger.We are living in an era of unimagined prosperity and peace. Despite the news media's tendency to lead with blood, we exist in a world where children today will live longer and happier lives than their parents. I may be wrong but I hope I'm not. Why paint a dystopian picture of the future when we can take a utopian photograph of the world around us right now and extrapolate out?I ran Gizmodo and CrunchGear and I'm currently the CEO of a Bitcoin company and East Coast Editor of TechCrunch. I have adopted new technologies with reckless abandon and I've seen just about every gadget pass before me over the past fifteen years. I know what is happening in the world and I can explain it.I'm a tech writer and I've seen just about every cool thing in tech pass through my transom. I'm ready to weigh in on exactly how everything fits together and I'm ready to try this medium for publication. If funded I'll write and produce the book in ebook and paperback form and if you back me I'll send you a copy.I love to write and this has been a dream project for me for a while. I'm the guy who can tell this story and I'm worried mainstream publishers don't want optimism when it comes to books about the future.Let's put that optimism back into the tech world.Why You?You're sick of naysayers. I know you are. You're sick of people telling you that things are awful and getting worse. I'm a paid cynic and I, myself, hate knee-jerk reactions to technology that suggest that everything from social media to robotics spells our doom. I don't believe that and neither do you.But I can temper this optimism with facts and you like that. You, like me, want the world to keep going after we're gone and we want to exist for the amazing things to come. We don't want jet-packs but we'd settle for green cars, robotic telepresence, and a new closeness to the world around us.I also want your input. I want to hear the good things you've learned over the years. I also want to hear your criticisms. I will create a forum for that as we begin writing together.But Tech Is Destroying Us!It isn't. It's making our lives better. You and I are in a conversation right now, mediated by your screen. I am telling you about something I want to write and you can tell me how to write it and you can support me or leave me hanging. I hope you'll join me and help disabuse

<< Back to mainBy Tangotiger 04:23 PM​Answer: current ultimate.Why? Well, let's say that you think it's a quick and easy tool. What else would you do? You might… well, use RE24 instead of wOBA. That's still part of the WAR framework, simply a different implementation. Maybe you want WPA? Sure, go ahead. Maybe you prefer Dewan to Lichtman? Sure. But all of that is still part of the same framework. That's why WAR is the ultimate tool: it allows you to swap in/out your various components. You can even choose to have a different scale for the fielding spectrum. You can even change the replacement level to something higher or lower. And still, you'd be using WAR.So, go ahead, and treat Fangraphs and Baseball Reference as something "quick and dirty". But I will promise you that whatever you will do will be even quicker and dirtier.What WAR does is give you a framework, and makes it very easy for everyone to have their own implementation. Don't like what you see? Well, you are being given a systematic, consistent framework to which you can build your own house. Go ahead and do it, and give us an open house to look at it.Or, complain that somehow these free WAR homes are not good enough and… well… keep wandering the streets with nowhere to sleep. The reality is that we all have some sort of WAR home. You just maybe don't know all the rooms in your own house, and the rooms keep changing, depending on which players come to visit. WAR at Fangraphs and Baseball Reference are merciless to its player guests.

The TTIP trade treaty talks re-open in Brussels this week. We should not be reassured by the convenient 'leak' of a private letter between key TTIP advocates claiming the treaty poses no threat to the NHS.NoTTIP Day of Action on July 12. Rachel Megawhat / Demotix. All rights reserved.The NHS has become a key battleground for the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), the controversial treaty currently being negotiated in secret between the European Commission and the US government.Now that more and more people are becoming aware of the threat that TTIP poses to public services, the European Commission and its friends have found a new and inventive way of trying to bamboozle people into accepting it.On the eve of the sixth round of talks, which begin in Brussels this week, a 'private' letter from the EU's chief negotiator, Ignacio Garcia Bercero, to John Healey MP was conveniently leaked to the Guardian and Financial Times. The letter attempts to downplay the fact that public health services are included in TTIP, suggesting that there is no need to fear for the NHS as a result.The media went further, suggesting that there was to be a 'carve out' for the NHS, or that US companies would not be allowed to run public health services in the future. Both claims are entirely false.The first thing to note is that there is nothing new in the letter, nor any change in the EU's position. The European Commission has used exactly the same arguments to defend the inclusion of health, education and other public services in all previous trade agreements, as those of us who have been engaged in these debates for the past 20 years know all too well. Yet trade experts point out that public services are still highly vulnerable when they are included in negotiations, particularly when private operators have been granted access to public sector contracts, as is the case with the NHS.The second thing to note is that the letter came from the chief EU negotiator to one of the principal cheerleaders for TTIP in Britain. John Healey chairs the all-party parliamentary group on EU-US investment, and has been doing his best to prevent trade unions and campaign groups from joining opposition to TTIP over the past few months. Happily, all major trade unions in Britain are now part of the campaign to stop TTIP. So here are some basic truths on the NHS and TTIP, starting with the most important and getting more technical as they go on:1. Health services, medical services (including midwifery and physiotherapy) and dental services are all included in the TTIP negotiations. We already knew this because we saw it with our own eyes in the EU's draft offer to the USA that was uncovered last month. Indeed, Garcia Bercero's letter acknowledges that health services are on the table. The only sector that has been excluded from the TTIP talks is audio-visual services, as a result of dogged insistence by the French. All other public services are in, and can be traded away for further liberalisation if the US negotiators so demand.If David Cameron wished to exclude the NHS or any other public service from the negotiations, he could do as the French government has done. All that is needed for this to happen, as the British Medical Association (BMA) has demanded, is for no mention of health services to appear in TTIP at all. In reality, of course, it is Cameron's government that has already opened up the NHS to private providers by means of the 2012 Health and Social Care Act. Why would he raise a finger to get it excluded from TTIP?2. Garcia Bercero's letter also confirms another key charge from opponents of TTIP: that the NHS is open to attack under the new investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) rules that TTIP would introduce between the EU and USA. For the first time, US corporations would be able to bypass our domestic courts and challenge our national health policy decisions before ad hoc arbitration tribunals, and to sue us for hundreds of millions of dollars in 'damages' as a result of future policy changes that might affect their bottom line. This is one clear mechanism that would prevent any future government from bringing the NHS back into public sector hands, as the cost of compensating private providers would render such a move instantly unattractive.Garcia Bercero would like us to believe that future challenges to the NHS would be 'unlikely'. Yet the Slovak Republic has already lost a multi-million dollar case under similar rules to Dutch insurance company Achmea for reversing the country's earlier (and deeply unpopular) privatisation of health insurance. Tobacco giant Philip Morris is currently using ISDS provisions to sue the Australian government for billions of dollars over its new public health law that all cigarettes must be sold in plain paper packaging. Ken Clarke MP, the minister with responsibility for TTIP, has admitted that the UK
"Magic mushrooms," the recreational hallucinogen long associated with music festivals and hippies, may also one day prove to have a powerful pharmaceutical effect for people with treatment-resistant depression.In a small pilot study at the Center for Neuropsychopharmacology at Imperial College London, more than half of participants who took psilocybin, the active compound in psychedelic mushrooms, showed a marked improvement in their depression symptoms while also demonstrating the compound's safety in a supervised setting.This is the first clinical trial to use the active chemical compound in so-called "magic mushrooms" to treat major depression. If the findings are confirmed in larger studies, it could mean a change in the way we treat depression symptoms in those who don't respond to therapy and traditional medications, like selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.What we knew before:Mushrooms from the genus Psilocybe contain psilocybin, which the human body breaks down into a substance called psilocin. This psychedelic substance then crosses the blood-brain barrier and binds to a specific serotonin receptor known as 5-HT2A, creating a profound alteration of consciousness that has been described as a mystical event, a spiritual journey or simply a "trip." Psychedelic compounds in LSD, ayahuasca and mescaline bind to this same receptor.Human beings have been consuming psychedelic mushrooms for thousands of years because of this effect, but it wasn't until the 1950s that scientists began examining psilocybin's therapeutic properties in earnest.Previous pilot studies have shown that psilocybin could be a promising new way to treat mental health symptoms like anxiety, obsessive-compulsive behavior and addiction. Those worried about the compound's effects on mental health needn't worry: Research shows that lifetime use of psychedelics like psilocybin is not an independent risk factor for mental health problems.Beyond binding with the 5-HT2A receptor, scientists don't really understand the chemical process that leads to this psychedelic experience. It's even less clear how having a mystical experience might produce long-term mental health benefits, but there are at least two theories, according to Dr. Stephen Ross, director of the Psychedelic Research Group at NYU Langone Medical Center. He was not involved in the study, but reviewed it.In the first theory, the memory of the "trip" -- which can be a profound and extremely meaningful experience -- could have a strong psychological effect on people, lifting their moods for months at a time. Alternatively, there may be a biological explanation: It's possible the binding of psilocin to the serotonin receptor sets off a cascade of yet-unknown chemical reactions that persist for weeks or months.The study details:Six men and six women with chronic, treatment-resistant, moderate to severe major depression consented to take two different doses of psilocybin (10 mg and 25 mg), separated by one week. There was no control group, and the participants and in what's called an "open label trial," the investigators all knew that they were either taking or administering psilocybin.During the dosing sessions, participants relaxed on a bed in a room with dim lighting and listened to music through earphones. Supervisors monitored their blood pressure, heart rate and the psychoactive effects of the compound intermittently for up to six hours after they took the pills, while psychiatrists offered support but mostly let patients have their own "inner journey," as the study put it, without interruptions.None of the participants experienced serious or unexpected negative side effects that required medical intervention from the dosing, though some reported mild anxiety, confusion, nausea or headache. The psychedelic effects peaked about two to three hours after dosing and then became negligible after about six hours.Most significantly, eight of the 12 patients responded extremely well to the psilocybin, meeting the criteria for remission from depression one week after the two treatments. After three months, five of them remained in remission, while another two continued to show improvement in their depression symptoms compared to baseline. Overall, all 12 patients showed at least some improvement in their symptoms for up to three weeks after the dose.The results seem promising, but there are some caveats. The overall positive response to the dosing treatment could in part be chalked up to the fact that the participants actively sought out the psilocybin trial and were probably expecting the medicine to work on some level, creating a bias in favor of the intervention. Indeed, five of the participants had already tried psilocybin at least once -- one just six months before the experiment, others ranging from 14 to 48 years prior.This past experience with a drug and its presumed positive effects could increase suggestibility and expectancy in people, which could affect the results. Double-blind trials in which neither patient nor therapist knows which intervention they received or administered, as well as the inclusion of a control group, could address these issues in

Well then. From Donald Trump's appearance on the Talk1300 radio show in New York this morning:Trump said the numbers were troubling and pointed to Hillary Clinton as proof that he probably won't get the kind of support among African-Americans that he deserves."I tell it like it is," Trump said. "[Y]ou'll hear a political reporter go on and say it had nothing to do with race. But how come she had such a tiny piece of the vote?

But unfortunately, it seems that, you know, the numbers you cite are very, very frightening numbers."
Sonic Boom officially welcomed the public to its brand-new space in the Robertson Building at 215 Spadina Ave. last month (and held a massive funeral party for its former Honest Ed's digs ). The change of address for the iconic record store, which has spent the last 13 years serving audiophiles in the Annex , with a newer location in Kensington Market , comes reluctantly after the sale of Mirvish Village forced them to vacate the lower portion of Honest Ed's . Thankfully, the big move hasn't wiped out the store's inventory or aesthetic.Many frantic hours were spent prepping the new Boom for its grand opening on September 27. The space was most recently used as an American Apparel factory outlet , and while the staff already had their work cut out for them to exorcise the ghosts of improperly dyed metallic jeggings from the premises, an equally difficult task was combining inventory from two separate stores into one unified location.As you may recall, Sonic Boom's original Bloor Street flagship was bigger than the one in Honest Ed's, hence the second branch in Kensington Market to house the overflow of vinyl and old-school paraphernalia. But with these new digs measuring a solid 13,000 square feet and centrally located on the southern edge of Chinatown, it made sense to bring everything together under one roof again.Walking up Spadina's east side, I was immediately greeted by the storefront's expanse of large windows, one emblazoned with the distinctive orange and blue logo. These massive glass panes will soon be filled with Sonic Boom's signature window displays designed by Tim Oakley, but for now they let a flood of sunlight wash over the front room. High ceilings and exposed wooden beams make for a decidedly more urban-chic feel than previous iterations of the shop."The top floor is kind of a smaller representation of the store as a whole," says owner Jeff Barber. It has a little of everything, including new releases on CD and vinyl, audio accessories like Urbanears headphones and Crosley turntables, plus Herschel bags and other fashion accessories. The entirety of their book collection is shelved along the back-right wall, with a pretty replete catalogue of 33â…" paperbacks that's tough not to geek out over.The merch on this level is accented with a bit of quirky decor that'll be new to you unless you visited the Bathurst location during it's final days. The "Captain Fantastic" Elton John pinball machine is charming and totally makes sense in the midst of all this vintage music gear; the animatronic stuffed bear looming over a container of batteries may need to be explained to me, though.Descending down the stairs at the back of the room leads me into the vastly bigger basement, which contains the bulk of the music selection. The rows-upon-rows of new and used stock will be totally recognizable to any previous Sonic Boom patron - every music genre is still well-represented here, though with particular emphasis on rock and indie.A pretty sizable DVD and Blu-ray collection is starting to fill out the front half of the room, while display cases towards the back show off cool box-set and oddball collectables (for example: thanks to this setup, I now know that a Celine Dion/Anne Geddes collabo exists. Amazing).That back end of the basement is where Sonic Boom will continue the tradition of in-store concerts, which in the past have featured the likes of Dinosaur Jr., Sloan, Aimee Mann and The Weakerthans , just to name a handful. The stage isn't set up yet, but the stack of guitar amps and mic stands against the wall are a sure enough sign of live tunes to come.Leaving the Annex behind was surely a tough sell for both Sonic Boom's customers and crew, who've come to consider the store an integral part of the neighbourhood. But the new address' increased foot traffic, expanded space and close proximity to Queen and Spadina's many hip hangouts should ensure that not much will change for Toronto's largest independent music shop. "We're sad to leave the Annex," Barber says, "but we're excited about becoming a part of this neighbourhood."Writing by Shazia Khan. Photos by Matt Forsythe.
PORTLAND, Ore. – A man from South Korea has a dream to cycle from Canada to Argentina on a solo trip. But his dream has been cut short by a thief in Portland.Minhyeong Kim's black-and-red Scott Sub 40 and the racks on the front and back holding his possessions were stolen last Friday night.Kim parked his bike and locked it up outside the Fred Meyer store on Southeast Cesar Chavez Boulevard and Hawthorne Boulevard last Friday night. He went in to to buy some food and the bike was gone when got back outside 20 minutes later.The bike and almost all his gear, from a tent to a laptop, had vanished. He said it was his entire life, his home on wheels.Kim is a young man who spent the past two years saving and planning, to fly from South Korea to Edmonton, Canada, and then to ride his bicycle all the way down to Argentina. He had made it 1,500 miles in 35 days. But his trip was stopped in Portland.Kim said he loves Portland, but what happened hurt him, and he wants the thief to know that."At first I'm very angry and sad because of you, but now I can forgive you," he said "I just want...return my bicycle for me."The Scott bike is mostly black with red graphics and is set up for long-haul touring. Anyone who sees it is asked to call Portland police at 503-823-3333.© 2018 KGW
If you didn't, even you're a huge Dodgers fan, don't be ashamed– very few other people noticed either. In fact, before the days of the internet it's likely no one would have mentioned it for years, if at all. The changes are quite subtle. Back in 2011, SportsLogos.net ran a post titled Dodgers Change Logo, Nobody Notices. Not many people noticed that post outside of the sports uniform blog scene. In only came to our attention today, nearly 2 years later. From the original article:The major minor-changes involve: The leading script into the 'o' of 'Dodgers', it's there in 2010, it's gone in 2012.the 'D' in 'Dodgers' also had a slight change, specifically the curl in the 9-o'clock region of the logo, it's much shorter in the 2012 edition.the flight lines of the baseball have been corrected. Not the most necessary change to ever occur but it does tidy the logo up nicely. As far as we can tell this it the first adjustment of the Dodgers primary logo since their move to Los Angeles from Brooklyn in 1958, that leading tail on the 'o' had been around in one-form-or-another since the 1930s.Perhaps especially because of the fact that it took even the most logo obsessed fans awhile to notice, the ultras over at Uni Watch were intrigued, so much that they landed an interview with the Dodgers Art Director, Ross Yoshida. Here's part of what he had to say:The most obvious change is the thickening of the ball and streaks and making the line weights uniform. This was done mostly to solve the problem of the red lines getting lost at smaller sizes. In addition, the Dodgers script was given an overall "refresh"—angles are sharper/cleaner and the script now has a more natural flow (the loop on the D, elimination of the stub on the o, the transition from the g to the e). The end of the underflourish also has an inverted scoop, subtly mimicking the underflourish on our jersey script.As far as we can tell by searching Uni Watch, there haven't been any other changes since the 2011/2012 season.

In these days of anxiety and alienation, Thanksgiving offers the warm embrace of inclusiveness. Particularly for many people with families and faiths rooted in other lands, no other holiday, not even the Fourth of July, has so great a capacity to make them feel American.A child of Orthodox Jewish immigrants could feel his apartness on other festivals celebrated by the larger society. Christmas, Easter, Halloween — all are distinctly Christian observances, no matter how temporal and commercialized they have become. They are inevitable reminders for some Americans that they are different.Thanksgiving's origins are also Christian. But it has evolved into something both secular and spiritual, a day devoted to family and amity. Perhaps that explains its unwavering appeal for believers and nonbelievers alike (even if many Native Americans understandably choose not to partake). Thanksgiving is at heart more than parades, or football or even country; there's no flag-waving or chest-thumping. It is about shared bounty and shared humanity.That's why the writer Saadia Faruqi, a Pakistan-born Muslim, welcomes the day. "For a Pakistani-American, Thanksgiving is as wholesome and normal a holiday as one can get," she said in a 2015 essay. "It is a time to be grateful, to spend time with family, and to have a little bit of fun." Though she never developed a taste for turkey, Ms. Faruqi wrote, the Thanksgiving table would most definitely be set — with tandoori chicken, daal and naan.
Just when I thought we'd have a long weekend without a big news dump, the WaPo published its story revealing Jared Kushner asked Sergey Kislyak to set up a channel of communication with Russia at Russian facilities at a meeting in early December.Jared Kushner and Russia's ambassador to Washington discussed the possibility of setting up a secret and secure communications channel between Trump's transition team and the Kremlin, using Russian diplomatic facilities in an apparent move to shield their pre-inauguration discussions from monitoring, according to U.S. officials briefed on intelligence reports. Ambassador Sergei Kislyak reported to his superiors in Moscow that Kushner, then President-elect Trump's son-in-law and confidant, made the proposal during a meeting on Dec. 1 or 2 at Trump Tower, according to intercepts of Russian communications that were reviewed by U.S. officials. Kislyak said Kushner suggested using Russian diplomatic facilities in the United States for the communications. The meeting also was attended by Michael Flynn, Trump's first national security adviser.That story — and additional details on Kushner's discussions with UAE — is the big headliner.But the fascinating detail is that WaPo received an anonymous letter with details of this meeting — and other things that the WaPo suggests it may not yet have confirmed — in mid-December.The Post was first alerted in mid-December to the meeting by an anonymous letter, which said, among other things, that Kushner had talked to Kislyak about setting up the communications channel. This week, officials, who reviewed the letter and spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive intelligence, said the portion about the secret channel was consistent with their understanding of events. For instance, according to those officials and the letter, Kushner conveyed to the Russians that he was aware it would be politically sensitive to meet publicly, but it was necessary for the Trump team to be able to continue their communication with Russian government officials. In addition to their discussion about setting up the communications channel, Kushner, Flynn and Kislyak also talked about arranging a meeting between a representative of Trump and a "Russian contact" in a third country whose name was not identified, according to the anonymous letter.So who could have sent the letter?First, consider the timing. The letter was sent within a few weeks of the meeting itself. In between the meeting and sending of the letter, these very same reporters got the scoop that the CIA believed Russia affirmatively wanted Trump elected, a scoop that pre-empted the President's call for a report on Russian tampering in the election. A week later, two of these reporters got another confirmation that John Brennan said the other agencies agreed with him on the view that Putin wanted Trump elected.The letter also got received a few days after John McCain got a copy of Christopher Steele's dossier (reportedly on December 9), followed just four days later by the last known and by far most incendiary installment of the dossier, which for the first time accused Trump's campaign of paying the DNC hackers.In other words, WaPo received the letter at a time when the IC was dumping a ton of information implicating Trump. So perhaps it was a spook who heard Kislyak's description of the meeting on an intercept.The dominant narrative on those intercepts, however, has said that the IC wasn't listening closely to Kislyak intercepts until after Russia did not retaliate in response to the hacking sanctions imposed on December 28, and didn't find the incriminating Mike Flynn conversations until around January 3. If that's right, then the IC wouldn't have heard about this meeting until weeks after the letter was sent. [Update: the NYT version of this–which appears to be damage control from the White House–cites a senior American official stating that they learned about this conversation "several months ago," which would put it after the letter was sent.]Of course, with the FBI and CIA getting their own raw feeds of data, it's possible one agency listened to the intercepts (and had the language skills to understand them) before another did. It's possible, for example, CIA learned about the meeting before FBI did so in the aftermath of the sanctions concerns.It's also possible that the Russians sent the letter — or even that Kislyak made up the Kushner claim as disinformation (remember, by this point there were leaks about FISA orders, with reports that Russian interlocutors were changing their communication habits). But it's unclear what Russia would have to gain by sending a letter in December, rather than waiting until Kushner had compromised himself. Doing so would eliminate all the control they had gained with the information.Which (barring a spook sending the letter) would seem to leave a Trump associate. Reportedly, WaPo's Miller said that the letter appears to come from someone inside the Trump transition. Anyone else at the meeting would seem to be an immediate target for Trump retaliation. Though it is possible that Mike Flynn sent the letter, realizing he was getting set up by Trump, which would make the delay
After a bizarre week, Jim McElwain is out at Florida, meaning one of the top 10 jobs in college football is open. The move means there could be as many as a half-dozen new head coaches in the SEC in 2018. Let's examine 10 candidates UF may consider. I think the Gators' options fit into three categories: the connected guys, the upstarts and the big names they might be able to woo.The Connected Guys with UF ties or local rootsDan Mullen, Mississippi State: He's an obvious choice. First-year Florida AD Scott Stricklin was his boss in Starkville. Mullen is a terrific offensive coach and that's something that should play well at a place that has been dreadful pretty much since Mullen left Gainesville almost a decade ago. He's 67–44 at a program that is the toughest to win at in the SEC West, and the Bulldogs are 6–2 this year. It's hard to think he can do much better in Starkville than he already has, and that includes two top-20 finishes in his eight previous seasons. On two different occasions he tried to get the Miami job, but was unable. It's hard to think he'd pass if Florida came within reach. Word is former Florida athletic director Jeremy Foley wasn't a big fan of Mullen's, but would he try and stand in the way of him getting this job or still have the juice to do that?Willie Taggart, Oregon: A South Florida native who is like the third Harbaugh brother, Taggart won at Western Kentucky and then won at USF, leaving Charlie Strong a stocked program, and he's done a very nice job pumping life back into the Ducks in his first year in Eugene. He and his staff are recruiting exceptionally well. Would he actually be tempted to come back home after moving his young family across the country for just one year? I'm not sure he could say no.Scott Frost, UCF: A Chip Kelly protégé, he's tearing it up in year two at UCF, which at 7–0 is the Group of Five's last unbeaten team. His name has come up often as a possible answer if his alma mater Nebraska pulls the plug on Mike Riley (I suspect it will). I'm told Frost might be more intrigued by a program with a stronger, much more fertile recruiting base than Nebraska—somewhere he can get tons of speed to fuel his system. A place like Florida would make a lot of sense. A question among some UF folks is whether the 42-year-old Frost is ready for this big stage. In retrospect, many realized, McElwain wasn't cut out for the job temperament-wise, and that figures to be something Florida will be mindful of in its search process.Charlie Strong, USF: Another former Urban Meyer assistant, Strong fizzled at Texas after three tumultuous seasons. He's doing well again in his first season at USF and is very well-connected around the state. He played a vital role in Meyer building a powerhouse at Florida, and Gator brass knows how well-respected he was inside the program. That should count for something. Does UF want someone more drawn to the spotlight than Strong? It just got rid of a guy who was not very comfortable under constant media scrutiny. Would it bring in another to replace him?The Big NamesJustin Fuente, Virginia Tech: He's 17–5 with the Hokies after turning a downtrodden Memphis football program into a winner. That was impressive. Fuente is also not paid a fortune by FBS coaching standards, but has a very good situation in Blacksburg working for a well-regarded AD in Whit Babcock. He's got a good job now, but UF is an even better job. If you're the Gators, you've gotta kick the tires on this one.Gary Patterson, TCU: One of the best defensive coaches in football, Patterson has the Horned Frogs rolling. He's done wonders there and they've upgraded the facilities dramatically for him. They've even built him a statue. Still, it's no secret that he'd listen if it's a program that he felt gave him a much better chance at winning national titles.Kevin Sumlin, Texas A&M: His résumé and experience is better than most of the guys on this list. He's likely to be looking for another job this winter. He's proven he can recruit very well in the SEC against anyone. He's 49–24, has never done worse than 8–5 at A&M and did lead the Aggies to their first top-five finish in over 50 years.Chip Kelly: The biggest free-agent name in coaching. Kelly is as sharp and innovative as any offensive mind in football. His offense would be scary with access to the speed you can recruit at Florida.
Evidently, the Pittsburgh Steelers aren't the only team in the NFL making roster moves. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers joined the event by making a few moves of their own.David Gilreath, who recently spent a few weeks on the active roster due to the injuries to Jerricho Cotchery and Antonio Brown; was released on Monday. With Brown possibly ready to return, Gilreath became expendable when the team needed healthy bodies along the offensive line.As David DeCastro was officially welcomed back to the active roster, and John Malecki was promoted from the practice squad; Marcus Gilbert was placed on injured/reserve.Seeking depth at receiver, and possibly special teams, the Buccaneers signed David Gilreath once the Steelers placed him on waivers. To make room for Gilreath, the Bucs demoted safety Sean Baker to the practice squad and released former Steelers offensive lineman, Chris Scott.Because the Steelers had already planned to move forward without Gilreath, his loss won't have any immediate effects on the active roster preparing to take on the Baltimore Ravens. However, Gilreath makes the third Steeler prospect to be signed with a new team in recent days, with Ryan Lee signing with the New Orleans Saints and Toney Clemons signing with the Jacksonville Jaguars.With Cotchery expected to return before the end of the season, the Steelers will not have to rely on any more rookies to play wide receiver, barring injury. Although, it is interesting. The Steelers who began the year with five running backs and four receivers, now find themselves with five receivers and only four backs with Baron Batch on the practice squad.
On May 6, Iowa City Police responded to a report of a person looking into vehicles. The police report states that the suspect, Nicholas Rotter (32), Iowa City, tried to flee from authorities, first on a bicycle and then on foot. After being chased by police, he was taken to the ground.After apprehending Rotter, police searched his backpack and found 2.1 grams of marijuana, 3 grams of methamphetamine, and a pot style meth lab. The bicycle which Rotter originally tried to flee on was found to be stolen from a nearby residence.Rotter was arrested for possession of a controlled substance, intent to manufacture a controlled substance, theft, and assault on a police officer.

Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama, a Republican member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, warned in a speech to the Faith and Freedom Coalition's Road to Majority conference today that "the courts are at risk" in the upcoming presidential election, lamenting that at least one current Supreme Court justice displays a "secular mindset."Sessions said that as the committee's ranking member during the confirmation hearings of Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, "I felt, like so many of you, the court hasn't been performing in a way we like it to."He repeated a criticism of Sotomayor that conservatives had leveled at her during her confirmation hearings, expressing dismay that she had approvingly quoted legal scholar Martha Minow's observation that in the law "there is no objective stance but only a series of perspectives — no neutrality, no escape from choice in judging," an acknowledgment of the hidden assumptions and biases that all judges bring to the law.Sessions said the quote "still makes the hair stand up on the back of my neck.""You see, this is a postmodern, relativistic, secular mindset and I believe it's directly contrary to the founding of our republic," he said."So I really think this whole court system is really important," he added later in the speech, "and the real value and battle that we're engaged in here is one to reaffirm that there is objective truth, it's not all relative. And that means some things are right and some things are wrong, and we're getting too far away from that in my opinion and it's not healthy for any country and it's really not healthy for a democracy like ours that's built on the rule of law."

FEW COULD IMAGINE the ultra-conservative Vatican at the epicentre of a rebellion against rampant capitalism and its destruction of the natural world. The release tomorrow (June 17th) of what may well be the most radical papal encyclical in modern history strongly suggests we do indeed live in extraordinary times.A leaked draft of the encyclical (or teaching letter) suggests that Pope Francis, a boxer in his youth, is coming out swinging, warning of the need for truly radical steps to arrest the "unprecedented destruction of the ecosystem". Put plainly, he warned: "destroy Creation and Creation will destroy us".This pope is making some powerful new enemiesThe pope explicitly links bare-knuckle capitalism with both ecological catastrophe and growing inequality. Given that just 67 billionaires control more than half the entire world's wealth – each individual billionaire controlling more resources than an average 100 million people – it is clear that the pope is making some powerful new enemies. These same plutocrats bankroll politics and own the media in many countries, so the backlash against Francis will be epic.In recent months, the science-savvy pontiff, who holds a master's degree in chemistry, outraged neoliberals by dismissing 'trickle-down' economics as "a failed theory". He went on to warn that "the invisible hand of capitalism cannot be trusted". He also argued that "excessive consumerism is killing our culture, values and ethics… and the conservative ideal of individualism is undermining the common good".Francis is the first pope from the Global South, the part of the world that has been the loser as globalised capitalism concentrated more power and wealth in fewer and fewer hands. His experience in his native Argentina, which was torn apart by economic collapses has left Francis deeply sceptical of the very capitalism pretty much every Irish politician, economist and commentator believes is essential to 'grow the economy'.Economic growth has come with a fearsome price tag. Half of all the wild animals on Earth have disappeared since 1970, according to a major WWF study. On our current trajectory, within the next three or four decades most of what remains of the natural world will quite literally have been wiped off the face of the planet. This generation of humans is both living through and the driving force behind the greatest global mass extinction event in at least the last 50 million years.We are facing chaos on a scale not witnessed since World War IIMeanwhile, despite the best efforts of the deniers to claim otherwise, climate change continues gathering both pace and momentum, setting in train processes that are, at least on human timescales, essentially irreversible.Polar scientists now calculate a minimum of five metres of sea level rise is already 'locked in' as a result of unstoppable melting events in Antarctica and Greenland. This is sufficient to redraw the map of the world, and render many of our great coastal cities uninhabitable over time. However, our current greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions pathway could, in just another decade or two, increase the amount of 'locked-in' ice melt to raise global sea levels by a staggering 20 metres over time.While global average temperatures have already risen by almost 1C, causing sharp rises in extreme weather events across the world, climate scientists warn that our ever-increasing GHG emissions as a result of burning fossil fuels are rapidly pushing the global temperature gauge towards the +2C 'red line'. Beyond this point lies a near future of weather disasters, famines, droughts and widespread economic and social disruption on a scale not witnessed since World War II.The ecological and climate emergency is quite literally the gravest threat human beings have ever collectively faced.While speaking as the head of the 1.2 billion-strong Catholic church, Francis stresses that this encyclical, Laudato si ("Blessed are You") is first and foremost a moral, rather than an overtly religious message. To drive home this point, the 200-page document will tomorrow be jointly launched by a Catholic cardinal, a Christian Orthodox church leader and a climate scientist who happens to be an atheist.The encyclical will make acutely uncomfortable reading for practising Catholics like Taoiseach Enda Kenny, who, in tandem with Environment minister, Alan Kelly, has decided – for short-term gain – to make ignoring climate change de facto government policy.This may be the most genuinely radical document in a generationThe timing of Francis' intervention is propitious: the UN's major climate conference, dubbed COP 21, takes place in Paris in December, and the pope is taking to the road on an intensive lobbying campaign in support of a deal radical enough to avert disaster. Scientists are impressed. "The encyclical is probably going to have a bigger impact than the Paris negotiations", said Gavin Schmidt of NASA."The attitudes hindering the path towards a solution…go from negating the problem to indifference, to
Remarks as Prepared for Delivery by Central Intelligence Agency Director Mike Pompeo at the University of Texas Annual National Security ForumOctober 12, 2017Good afternoon everyone. It's great to be in Texas, and a privilege to be with you here at UT Austin. I very much look forward to our conversation today with Stephen Slick and to taking your questions.Espionage—the art and science of running assets and stealing secrets. This professional activity is at the heart of the organization I am now privileged to lead.In America, we don't do espionage for fun, although it often does bring joy and professional satisfaction. We don't do it to help American businesses or to gain information about Americans.No, in our Republic, the CIA's espionage is aimed at the singular purpose of collecting foreign intelligence to keep America safe. Period. Full stop.I raise this, because while it may seem trite, or even pedantic, it is, as I will share with you today, central to the effectiveness of the team I lead. So that will be my first point: the effectiveness derived from conducting espionage that is solely focused on supporting America's national security.The second thing you must know is that the CIA, to be successful, must be aggressive, vicious, unforgiving, relentless — you pick the word. We must every minute be focused on crushing our enemies and providing unfair advantage for our diplomats, our military and our President.This too may seem obvious, but it has not always been so straightforward. Today, I want to share with you why this matters and how we are punishing our enemies in order to defeat them.But before I return to why the purpose of CIA's espionage is so central to our success and to the fact that unceasing risk-taking is foundational, a quick reminder...At this very moment, there's a CIA team preparing for a mission in a very dangerous part of the world. There's not much of a US footprint there, nor is it a place where our brothers and sisters in the military can operate.The infrastructure our officers will need there will be built by the Agency's support specialists, who can set up shop anywhere on the planet. The communications and surveillance equipment they require will be provided by our science and technology experts, whose achievements are legendary. And if there's a need for cyber support, our Directorate of Digital Innovation staff will troubleshoot for them.The point is that CIA wouldn't be adding much value to the national security effort—or providing value for American taxpayers—if we confined ourselves to the relative comfort of world capitals and fancy embassies. The secrets of greatest utility are typically the ones embedded within the most rugged and hostile environments and possessed by those who do not share American values. If President Trump is to make the right policy choices there, he needs to understand the facts on the ground in the grittiest back alleys, densest jungles—in the hard places.Every day, including this one, CIA officers take extraordinary risks to put crucial intelligence in the hands of our President. A few weeks back I was with an officer a bit younger than most of you in this room, had early that morning come back from an operation that would be rejected as implausible by any worthy publisher. The President rightly counts on us to answer his questions about global threats, trends, and hotspots. And if we do our job right, we give an enormously unfair advantage to him and his top policymakers when it comes to dealing with foreign challenges.Now that our heads are collectively set in the world in which the CIA operates, back to the main mission for today.The CIA's Purpose and Why It Matters—A ComparisonSo, why do we do what we do? I don't mean simply why do we conduct intelligence. That's obvious.The important question is: For what purpose do we conduct espionage? This purpose matters. Let me show it by comparing our efforts with those of the Islamic Republic of Iran.At our founding, Americans were deeply skeptical of collecting intelligence, leaving the United States alone among the great powers in being reluctant to even get into the spy business. It took two world wars before CIA was established in 1947 as America's first comprehensive peacetime intelligence agency.Like all other elements of the US national security community, we take an oath to uphold and defend the Constitution. We strictly abide by our nation's laws. We're subject to oversight by the elected representatives of our fellow citizens.And as I said, because we conduct espionage that is solely aimed at supporting our country's national security, we work with a sense of duty, purpose, and righteous resolve—and we're a lot more effective because of it.Let's compare this with the intelligence service of the world's largest state sponsor of terror, the Islamic Republic of Iran. The MOIS and IRGC intel services simply can't be as effective as the
KIRSTEN POWERS: It's not -- this idea that -- so Democrats believe that people are entitled to certain things. They're entitled to healthcare, they're entitled to food. They're entitled to some basic necessities of life.BILL O'REILLY: Yeah, free stuff. Free. Free.POWERS: What you call "free stuff" and what Jeb Bush calls "free stuff" that actually are necessities in life. So the problem with when he said "free stuff" is that he's talking about children getting food. He's talking about people who -- a lot of the people who receive welfare, even the adults are working poor. They're people who have jobs. But they don't have enough money to get food, so it's --O'REILLY: Yeah, but that's -- that myth has been busted time and time and time again.POWERS: It's is not a myth, it's not even -- it's not a myth, no, no.O'REILLY: Sure it is. Look, if you look -- if you look at the studies of poverty --POWERS: At least 50 percent are working.O'REILLY: Powers. If you look at the studies of poverty, most poor people in this country have computers, have big screen TVs, have cars, have air conditioning. This myth that there are kids who don't have anything to eat is a total lie. And --POWERS: It is absolutely not a lie, and there actually are students --O'REILLY: It is absolutely a total lie on a mass level.POWERS: There actually are students in New York City, there are kids in New York City who go all weekend without anything to eat except when they eat in the schools. That is absolutely a fact.O'REILLY: Oh, that is such the biggest baloney. You produce one. You produce one. You can't.POWERS: And I know it's a fact, I know that because of the churches that I have worked with in New York City who serve those children. I mean, it's an absolute fact.O'REILLY: There are food banks in these churches, and it goes back to the parents who are usually derelicts of some kind.POWERS: I'm sorry, Bill, but there are people who -- no, no.O'REILLY: And who squander the food stamps that come in, who sell them on the black market. This is insane. You are telling me that you believe in the United States of America, with all the entitlement programs and food stamps and everything else, there are urchins running around that don't have any food because of the system?POWERS: There are children.O'REILLY: No, it's their parents who are abusing them.POWERS: And -- they're children. And who -- being poor is not abuse, actually. Being poor is not child abuse. And there are people who actually work very hard and who still cannot make enough money to make ends meet and have enough food for their children. And I'm sorry that you refuse to believe that, but it --O'REILLY: That is, look. The entitlement culture that we have in place, the entitlement culture we have in place -- public housing, food stamps, direct payments, all kinds of things have wiped that out.

LONDON (Reuters) - At least 3 million barrels of Iraqi Kurdish oil are on ships heading to Asia, with trade sources naming China as a possible destination as the autonomous region expands efforts to establish independent oil sales in defiance of Baghdad.A flame rises from a chimney at Taq Taq oil field in Arbil, in Iraq's Kurdistan region, August 16, 2014. REUTERS/Azad LashkariTwo sources with knowledge of the matter said Iraqi Kurdistan was in talks to potentially supply China with 4 million barrels of oil.Reuters was unable to identify the Chinese parties involved in the talks, which the sources declined to name, and it was not clear if the cargoes currently on the water were part of the discussions.A deal could place Beijing on a collision course with Baghdad, one of its major crude oil suppliers, which has tried to block the Kurdish sales that it says are illegal. The Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) argues they are allowed under the Iraqi constitution."The Kurds are in the process of negotiations with the Chinese," said one of the sources, who asked not to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter."China is buying up multiple origins of oil. So, there is not an issue from that side," the source added. "It will come down to price."Since May, Iraqi Kurdistan has shipped over 11 million barrels of crude from the Turkish port of Ceyhan. The Kurdish sales have been shrouded in mystery, and the KRG has declined to say who is helping it arrange the deals. Trading sources said they may have to discount the oil to attract buyers in a well-supplied market.According to a Reuters analysis of tanker tracking data, at least three Kurdish cargoes of 1 million barrels each have sailed from Ceyhan towards Asia in the past month, including one that was transferred to a supertanker near the Strait of Singapore on Monday.Prior to the latest shipments only one 1 million barrel cargo had gone to Asia, but the KRG may be seeking a new major buyer after an attempt to sell crude into the United States this summer became embroiled in a legal tangle.China's giant state-backed energy firms, including China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) and PetroChina, together work on over a fifth of the Baghdad-run oil projects. But Beijing also has stakes in Iraqi Kurdistan's oil production through Sinopec's 2009 acquisition of Addax Petroleum [SASAAP.UL].Establishing a buyer as large as China could provide reassurance to other countries and companies who would like to buy oil from the Kurds but fear the ramifications of crossing Baghdad, which has repeatedly threatened legal action.Senior officials at CNPC and Sinopec declined to comment. A spokesman from the KRG's Ministry of Natural Resources declined to comment when asked about the talks."KRG crude, priced at a significant discount, is finding its way across the world to many destinations despite the reluctance of big trading houses due to backlash from (Iraqi state oil marketer) SOMO," said another source involved with the talks, who also declined to be identified."As one of the world's biggest crude buyers, China is no exception. I believe that a deal is imminent for Chinese refineries to purchase KRG crude."SHIP-TO-SHIPThe Ultimate Freedom suezmax tanker, carrying 1 million barrels of Kurdish oil from Ceyhan, this week carried out a ship-to-ship transfer of its cargo to the Northern Star, a Very Large Crude Carrier that can hold 2 million barrels of oil. The vessels were just outside the Singapore Strait in Malaysian waters.An official at the Malaysian Port of Tanjung Pelepas (PTP) and the ship's captain confirmed a transfer between the two vessels took place.The Singapore-based head of shipping at Nathalin Offshore Company Ltd, which manages the Northern Star, denied its ship was involved in a ship-to-ship transfer.Two more Kurdish tankers, the United Dynamic and United Emblem, have sailed through the Suez Canal in the past week and are listed as heading to Asia 'for orders'.GROWING SALESAfter a stuttering start, Iraqi Kurdistan's oil sales now appear to be gaining momentum.More tankers have loaded at Ceyhan this week, while a number of deliveries in the eastern Mediterranean appear to have been made since the start of this month.The KRG's oil sales efforts increasingly resemble a cat-and-mouse game with Baghdad, with tankers loaded with crude frequently turning off satellite tracking before reappearing empty several days later. In some instances ships have sailed towards certain ports before sharply changing direction.A number of cargoes have gone to Israel, sources have said. MOL Group, which has assets in Iraqi Kurdistan, has also bought at least
Clashes started again on Syria's southern front, especially in Quneitra, between the factions and the Syrian forces, while militants committed a massacre in the countryside of Hama, killing 14 people.Twenty members of the Islamic State (IS, formerly known as the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham, or ISIS) were killed in Syrian air force raids over Raqqa governorate.The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said, "At least 20 IS members were killed and others were injured due to air force raids over a training base for IS militants," adding that 14 military vehicles were also destroyed.Armed groups in Golan launched an operation named "By the sun and its brightness" (Surat al-Shams) yesterday [July 10]. Brigades from the Military Council of the Free Army are participating in the operation, alongside others from the Ababil Horan Brigade, Martyrs of Damascus, the Husayn Bin Ali Battalion, Infantry Division 24, al-Haramain Brigade, Shabab al-Huda (Huda Youth Brigade), in addition to Jabhat al-Nusra, the Levant Liberation Band and Liwa al-Fatihin.This operation aims to take over the 90th Brigade's fort, affiliated with the Free Syrian Army in the middle area of Quneitra.The media office of the Syrian Rebels Front said they took over a military unit in Ain al-Darb and its neighboring farms.This operation is the first in months in the Golan, where militants were able to take over the Red Hills near the border with the occupied Golan, while the army was able to regain control over the middle area.This attack aims to secure larger areas under the control of militants on one hand, and to create a connection between the countryside of Quneitra and the countryside of Houran, on the other hand.It is intriguing that Jabhat al-Nusra is participating in the clashes alongside the Free Syrian Army after it distanced itself from previous battles due to the tension between them and the other factions in Houran, after the leader of Jabhat al-Nusra's military council, Ahmad al-Nehme was arrested. During the past few days, Jabhat al-Nusra invaded a number of villages that are under the control of the Free Syrian Army.The Syrian news agency, SANA, said militants committed a massacre in Khotab in the countryside of Hama, killing 14 people.The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported, "The casualties included children and women, others were executed and their bodies dismembered by the brigades in that area." Minister of Justice Najm al-Ahmad declared that a committee is being formed to investigate what happened in the village.Sources affiliated with the armed opposition accused the dead of being "informants" who work for the Syrian forces.In Idlib, clashes continue around the Hamidiya camp, south of Maarat al-Numaan, while the Observatory for Human Rights said militants took over a checkpoint near the camp. Clashes also continue in the neighboring area of Madajen.In Hasakah, a suicide bomber from IS targeted a Kurdish People's Protection Units checkpoint in Ain al-Arab, around which clashes between IS and the Kurdish units have been occurring.In Eastern Ghouta, Jaysh al-Islam militants attacked an IS office in Midaa and Misraba, amid reports of the death of a number of IS emirs, including Abu Mohamed al-Homsi, Abu Jaafar and Abu Hamzeh. A source from the Jaysh al-Islam said the killer of "the Sharia judge" Ouns Kweider (Abu Himam al-Shami) has been "punished." There have also been reports of the death of the IS emir of the southern area of Damascus, Abu Siyah.
65863. (a) Each city, county, or city and county shall ensure that its housing element inventory described in paragraph (3) of subdivision (a) of Section 65583 or its housing element program to make sites available pursuant to paragraph (1) of subdivision (c) of Section 65583 can accommodate, at all times throughout the planning period, its remaining unmet share of the regional housing need allocated pursuant to Section 65584, except as provided in paragraph (2) of subdivision (c). At no time, except as provided in paragraph (2) of subdivision (c), shall a city, county, or city and county by administrative, quasi-judicial, legislative, or other action permit or cause its inventory of sites identified in the housing element to be insufficient to meet its remaining unmet share of the regional housing need for lower and moderate-income households.(b) (1) No city, county, or city and county shall, by administrative, quasi-judicial, legislative, or other action, reduce, or require or permit the reduction of, the residential density for any parcel to, or allow development of any parcel at, a lower residential density, as defined in paragraphs (1) and (2) of subdivision (g), unless the city, county, or city and county makes written findings supported by substantial evidence of both of the following:(A) The reduction is consistent with the adopted general plan, including the housing element.(B) The remaining sites identified in the housing element are adequate to meet the requirements of Section 65583.2 and to accommodate the jurisdiction's share of the regional housing need pursuant to Section 65584. The finding shall include a quantification of the remaining unmet need for the jurisdiction's share of the regional housing need at each income level and the remaining capacity of sites identified in the housing element to accommodate that need by income level.(2) If a city, county, or city and county, by administrative, quasi-judicial, legislative, or other action, allows development of any parcel with fewer units by income category than identified in the jurisdiction's housing element for that parcel, the city, county, or city and county shall make a written finding supported by substantial evidence as to whether or not remaining sites identified in the housing element are adequate to meet the requirements of Section 65583.2 and to accommodate the jurisdiction's share of the regional housing need pursuant to Section 65584. The finding shall include a quantification of the remaining unmet need for the jurisdiction's share of the regional housing need at each income level and the remaining capacity of sites identified in the housing element to accommodate that need by income level.(c) (1) If a reduction in residential density for any parcel would result in the remaining sites in the housing element not being adequate to meet the requirements of Section 65583.2 and to accommodate the jurisdiction's share of the regional housing need pursuant to Section 65584, the jurisdiction may reduce the density on that parcel if it identifies sufficient additional, adequate, and available sites with an equal or greater residential density in the jurisdiction so that there is no net loss of residential unit capacity.(2) If the approval of a development project results in fewer units by income category than identified in the jurisdiction's housing element for that parcel and the jurisdiction does not find that the remaining sites in the housing element are adequate to accommodate the jurisdiction's share of the regional housing need by income level, the jurisdiction shall within 180 days identify and make available additional adequate sites to accommodate the jurisdiction's share of the regional housing need by income level. Nothing in this section shall authorize a city, county, or city and county to disapprove a housing development project on the basis that approval of the housing project would require compliance with this paragraph.(d) The requirements of this section shall be in addition to any other law that may restrict or limit the reduction of residential density.(e) This section requires that a city, county, or city and county be solely responsible for compliance with this section, unless a project applicant requests in his or her initial application, as submitted, a density that would result in the remaining sites in the housing element not being adequate to accommodate the jurisdiction's share of the regional housing need pursuant to Section 65584. In that case, the city, county, or city and county may require the project applicant to comply with this section. The submission of an application for purposes of this subdivision does not depend on the application being deemed complete or being accepted by the city, county, or city and county.(f) This section shall not be construed to apply to parcels that, prior to January 1, 2003, were either (1) subject to a development agreement, or (2) parcels for which an application for a subdivision map had been submitted.(g) (1) If the local jurisdiction has adopted a housing element for the current planning period that is in substantial compliance with Article 10.6 (commencing with Section 655
As a human species we tend to have an explosive curiosity for the world around us. I feel it is what makes us unique, and probably is what makes humans the dominant species. I was in the store the other day and I overheard someone else's child making the inquiring "why" repeatedly. I have to admit I often ask the question why in my own life, it's what drove me to study science. However, it's the obsession with the "why" that also causes us to sometimes think irrationally. There are absolute truths in the universe, but what makes something true? Often times we have our minds set so much on the "why" that we miss the entire "what" and "how". I feel the one absolute truth (no matter what you believe) is that we have no idea what absolute truth and knowledge is.                I have always studied science to get answers to why things are the way they are. It wasn't until my last year of undergraduate that I realized that science doesn't have the answer why (I know that took a long time, but I always thought I just needed to learn more). That caused a deep sense of depression, heartache, and confusion inside of me. The truth is science doesn't teach "why", instead scientists answer the question "how". The laws of physics are defined not because Newton said "that's why gravity pulls on things", but because he observed a pattern of things falling due to some imaginary force. What is gravity, why does it exist? Those are two questions scientists don't know, and only one of them they are trying to answer.                I feel the problem lies in the false perception we are given as children. Often times people talk about something we call "intuition". What is intuition? Google says it is "the ability to understand something immediately, without the need to conscious reasoning".  So when we say science is intuitive, it is because science is just how the universe works. Of course it's intuitive, it's because we see it every day of our lives. Few people stop to think the reason we aren't floating is because of gravity, they just intuitively know that gravity is working and always has. What bothers me is that we give a false impression that science and intuition go together. THIS IS WRONG. Why is quantum mechanics so difficult for people to comprehend? It is because you can't use intuition unless you are an experimental physicist or physical chemist.                I finally started piecing the puzzle together after my first year of graduate school. Nothing "makes sense" in physics, it isn't meant to. Physics answers the question of how things work, and can be used to predict future events based on initial conditions. Quantum physics is the same thing as classical physics experimentation wise. Basically we do a bunch of experiments, and get certain results. The only difference between classical physics and quantum physics: the results. On a smaller scale we get new results, thus we are forced into creating new models for our system. However this does not mean that Newton was wrong, or that Einstein Dirac or Heisenberg was wrong. All this means is that quantum mechanics is a model that works on a smaller scale than classical mechanics. As my graduate quantum mechanics professor put it so elegantly "an electron does what an electron does, and it doesn't give a damn what you think." In other words things happen no matter the human reasoning behind it.                This is why I like to talk about how humans don't know what absolute truths are out there. Science is a continually evolving field because our experiments get better, and we can build off of old models. We are continually learning "new" "truths", and sometimes throwing out old "truths". Our experiments can show how things work, but if we knew the "why" then science would be dead. The why is a by all end all, and really an impossible question to answer. "Why" leads to circular logic and will never be truly answered. So why the obsession with "why" is a question I don't know the answer to. After all it's a "why" question. It could be just a genetic trait built into humans, perhaps it's an evolutionary step to make us the critical thinking tool builders that we are today. It obviously has some benefit since it's built into us at birth. I do feel, however, it can be the cause of our logical downfall if we are too OCD about it.                Perhaps this is the cause of religion in the world. If you are religious please don't be offended by my language here. I fully admit I do not have the answers, and perhaps there is a God or gods or flying spaghetti monster. With that logic, however, I also will tell you that you have no proof of a God or gods or flying spaghetti monster. This is exactly the topic that I would like to discuss.                Often people try to "prove" religion or
Doug Schoen, a former consultant to Bill Clinton, argued the case that the Democrats should keep their ties to Wall Street in a NYT column this morning. While he does advance his argument with some red-baiting and bad logic, he uses tradition as a starting point."Many of the most prominent voices in the Democratic Party, led by Bernie Sanders, are advocating wealth redistribution through higher taxes and Medicare for all, and demonizing banks and Wall Street."Memories in politics are short, but those policies are vastly different from the program of the party's traditional center-left coalition. Under Bill Clinton, that coalition balanced the budget, acknowledged the limits of government and protected the essential programs that make up the social safety net."President Clinton did this, in part, by moving the party away from a reflexive anti-Wall Street posture. It's not popular to say so today, but there are still compelling reasons Democrats should strengthen ties to Wall Street."Of course memories are not actually short, contrary to what Schoen claims. Many supporters of harsher policies directed against the financial sector remember the stock bubble whose crash led to what was at the time, the longest period without job growth since the Great Depression. They also remember a financial sector that continued to run wild as the housing bubble inflated. And they remember the Great Recession that followed the collapse of that bubble. And, they remember the government's bailout policies that ensured that the financial industry types would end up on their feet and not in jail.But Schoen does go beyond appealing to tradition."America is a center-right, pro-capitalist nation. ... Even in May 2016, when Senator Sanders made redistribution a central part of his platform, Gallup found that only about 35 percent of Americans had a positive image of socialism, compared with 60 percent with a positive view of capitalism."It's good that Schoen found an occasion to denounce "socialism" and tout capitalism. It also has nothing to do with the issue at hand. Very few of the people criticizing Wall Street consider themselves socialists. In fact, many view the waste and corruption of Wall Street as being an obstacle to a more efficient productive capitalist economy. Given the enormous damage caused by the collapse of the last two Wall Street driven bubbles, there is a pretty good case here.Then we get some great unsupported assertions, which is something I guess you get to do if you were a buddy of Bill Clinton:"Fourth, demonizing Wall Street does nothing to bridge the widening gaps in our country. Wall Street has its flaws and abuses, which were addressed in part by the Dodd-Frank financial reform law. And yes, the American people are certainly hostile to and suspicious of Wall Street. But using this suspicion and hostility as the organizing principle for a major political party will consign Democrats to permanent minority status."Hmmm, "cracking down on Wall Street does nothing to bridge the widening gaps in our country," really? There are a lot of really rich people on Wall Street. If we applied a modest financial transactions tax and put many of them out of business, this wouldn't reduce inequality in the United States?If we limited the tax deduction for corporate interest payments and other loopholes that have allowed private equity people to become incredibly rich, wouldn't this help to bridge the gaps in the country? How about if we made low cost retirement accounts universally available, as is being done in California, Illinois, and Oregon, so that people didn't have to pay thousands of dollars a year from their 401(k)s to finance types for doing nothing. Wouldn't that help to close the gap?And suppose that instead of bailing out the financial industry we had prosecuted them for the crimes they committed during the buildup of the bubble and have continued to do since then. Wouldn't putting people with hundreds of millions or billions of dollars behind bars help to reduce the gap?It seems like just about everything that progressive Democrats have proposed relative to the financial sector would help to reduce the income and wealth gap. Basically Schoen is spewing nonsense here.He does have a couple of good points that are worth noting. He argues that it is, "hypocritical for Democrats to maintain ties to Silicon Valley and then turn their backs on the very people who help finance its work." Well financing its work has nothing to do with the time of day. Should we not prosecute a restaurant engaged in money laundering because they serve food to Silicon Valley types?But Schoen does have an argument that many Silicon Valley types (think Facebook, Google, and Uber) are engaging in practices that are as corrupt and harmful to the economy and society as the financial industry. It is hypocritical to give these Silicon Valley practices a green light while going after Wall Street.And Schoen scores big in pointing out:"In the 2016 election, the Center for Responsive Politics reports, employees and companies in the securities and investment industry donated more than $
Donnie Wahlberg is showing some love for Waffle House … again.The 47-year-old Blue Bloods star and New Kids on the Block singer made a stop at the popular chain restaurant in Charlotte, North Carolina late on Wednesday night — where he rewarded the staff with a $2,000 tip as well as front row tickets and backstage passes to his band's Total Package Tour."My mom waited tables, and my dad tended bars– for years!" Wahlberg wrote on Instagram, captioning a photo of his $82.60 check and the Waffle House staff. "So, when I walk into a #WaffleHouse, and the staff treats me like a king, you better believe I treat them like queens! Thanks to the team at @wafflehouseofficial Charlotte, NC!"This isn't the first time Wahlberg has shown his generosity for Waffle House employees. In late June, Wahlberg stopped in for a meal at the restaurant in Edgewood, Maryland and left the overnight staff a $500 tip — tweeting a photo with Waffle House staffers Tyler Spangler and Angi Silen, whom he called a "great crew" and thanked for their "awesome service."On Wednesday night, Wahlberg — who has been documenting his Waffle House meals around the country on social — also took to Facebook live, where he interacted with the staff and patrons while waiting for his order of steak, eggs, grits and bacon to arrive."This Waffle House is happening," he said, panning around the busy restaurant — his first stop in North Carolina after flying in from New York City, where he was filming Blue Bloods. "We need to come to Charlotte more often. This Waffle House is love. Everyone's in a good mood in this Waffle House. Southern hospitality!"RELATED: Celebrities Who Have Left Big Tips at Restaurants"We're just going to have to invite this whole Waffle House to the concert tomorrow," he said, first passing verbal invitations to his waitress, named Chocolate. "You going in the front row too!"Great crew at @WaffleHouse in Edgewater MD! Thanks for the awesome service!

Thank you! pic.twitter.com/AQE5P2WtzA — Donnie Wahlberg (@DonnieWahlberg) June 30, 2017Wahlberg then asked another server named Trina if she's working tomorrow. "You gotta be sick. We're going to give you tickets. Everyone's going."Earlier in the cast, Wahlberg gave tickets to a fan named Jasmine too."She was so nice — we're giving you backstage passes and tickets tomorrow for your mom too," Wahlberg said. "She's bringing her mom. She's coming tomorrow, she's going to meet Boyz II Men and all the New Kids."He knows a thing or two about restaurants too, co-owning the Wahlburgers burger chain with his brothers Mark and Paul. Though he admitted on Wednesday's Facebook Live, "If I'm not at Whalbergs, guess where I am? Waffle House."The Total Package Tour, which launched in May and includes Boyz II Men and Paula Abdul, is wrapping up its final four shows this weekend — with stops in Charlotte; Duluth, Georgia; Tampa, Florida; and Hollywood, Florida.
0 SharesThey may not have had very many lines but their presence in a whitewashed world was enough to get my imagination going.Angelina Johnson from Harry PotterYou know how when you're young and you really, really love a movie? Only there are little to no black people in it and so you cling to the one character in the background who looks like you and imagine this totally detailed world in your head for them?As a pre-teen, I was utterly obsessed with Harry Potter. The whiteness of the wizarding world wasn't lost on me, which is why I loved any mention of characters like Dean Thomas and Lee Jordan. They were reminders that black people – people like me – existed in the world I was so crazy about. One character I especially came to like was Angelina Johnson, to the point where I couldn't help but make up complicated storylines for her in my head. Just picture it: The Adventures of Angelina Johnson. While trying to avoid whatever fatal threat Hogwarts attracts each year, star Quidditch player Angelina Johnson struggles to keep family drama at bay, as her recently divorced muggle mother and wizard father butt heads over the safest environment for their only daughter. As the difficulty of her classes increases, the pressure is also on to find a career path that suits her. Will she decide to start her new adult life in a wizarding world that can be as painfully oblivious to its own prejudices as the muggle one she grew up in? Will she ever manage to get some quality alone time with her favorite Weasley twin? Can't any year at Hogwarts ever just run smoothly?Honestly, you don't know how badly I wanted this story to exist. I still do.Missandei from Game of ThronesI've never been a fan of the 'person who is freed then decides to serve as a choice' narrative. It's never struck me as genuine, or even realistic. Rather, it's a way for the (usually white) protagonist to continue to oppress people while still getting to keep their Good Guy title.Ever since her introduction, I've been waiting to learn more about Missandei. There's got to be something underneath that veneer of polite devotion. How does she really feel about Daenerys? What was her life like before Westeros's favorite white savior showed up? What does she really want to do, now that she's free?At this point in Game of Thrones, I'm so annoyed with so many of the plotlines that I'm really tuning in for the little things. I want to find out when Missandei and Grey Worm are going to start going steady. After that intense scene in the lake and the conversation that followed, they're officially my Game of Thrones OTP (One True Pairing). Here's hoping that Missandei can disentangle herself from Daenerys and whatever is about to go down with her next season. Does anyone else have the feeling that it's not going to be good?Jacqui from The Walking DeadA part of me knows that I should not have had high expectations for a show where a black man called T-Dog managed to exist for nearly 3 seasons as a sort-of main character without the viewer ever learning anything about his motivations or backstory. Still, I cringed watching the season 1 finale, when the group was content to let Jacqui stay at the CDC and end her own life through an explosion, but God forbid we lose Andrea. We never even got a hint of who Jacqui might be as a person. We couldn't take a break from Lori's messy love life or Andrea and Amy's boring fishing metaphors to learn how Jacqui came to be all alone?In an interview with AMC TV, actress Jeryl Prescott (who is a former university professor and seems like the coolest woman ever) shared her theory that Jacqui was rescued by Morgan and together they raised his adorable son.Head canon accepted!Tamara, that one black female hunter on SupernaturalBeing a hunter in the Supernatural universe is so dependent on not only being able to lie effectively, but to get other people to believe you. Thanks to the magic of being a white male, Sam and Dean are able to put on a Good Will suit and convince just about anyone that they're supposed to be wherever it is they're sneaking into. Would a black person impersonating law enforcement or the FBI have the same results? What about a black woman?On top of that, a lot of hunters seem like, well, rednecks. At least the ones Sam and Dean are exposed to. Being country doesn't mean you're racist, but there's bound to be some overlap, and I would love to see how things would play out for a black female hunter navigating two very different worlds that, unfortunately both suffer from similar problems.Are there any black female characters who you saw in the background of

Product ResearchFeaturesControlsInputs and OutputsFeaturesCEA-2006 Compliant: CEA-2006 is a new system of testing & measurement methods for mobile audio amplifiers. This voluntary standard advocates a uniform method for determining an amplifier's RMS power output and signal-to-noise ratio. The criteria for measuring power uses a DC input voltage of 14.4 volts and the RMS power output is measured into a 4-ohm load, with 1% or less Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) plus noise, and at a frequency range of 20 Hz to 200 Hz when applicable. Signal-to-Noise ratio is measured in weighted absolute decibels (dBA) at a reference of 1 watt into 4 ohms. CEA-2006 allows consumers to compare car amplifiers and receivers on an equal basis. The Kenwood KAC-9103D under CEA-2006 regulations is rated at 500 Watts RMS x 1 channel with a 94dBA signal to noise ratio.Mono-Power Amp Design: The Kenwood KAC-9103D is designed with specific features to power your subwoofers with a frequency range between 5-200 Hz. This amplifier is not designed to power a full-range speaker.1-Ohm Stable: The Kenwood mono-amplifier is capable of handling load impedances down to 1-ohm. The amplifier is rated at 900 Watts RMS x 1 channel in 2 ohms at 100Hz with 1.1% THD. The amp is rated at over 900 Watts RMS x 1 channel in a 1ohm load.Class D Amplifier Design: The KAC-9103D is a Class D mono-block amplifier, which uses digital switching to amplify audio signals. This design results in high efficiency and less heat.MOS-FET Switching Power Supply: The amplifier utilizes a MOS-FET switching power supply providing thermal stability and efficient switching speeds guaranteeing performance and dependability.Parallel Connection: The amplifier is equipped with two pairs of gold-plated speaker terminals for an easy parallel subwoofer connection.Dressing Cover: The Kenwood KAC-9103D features a top cover that conceals all of its controls. This provides a very clean look as well as protects the amplifier's controls from being accidentally changed. The cover is held in place by two hex head screws. An allen-wrench is supplied to remove the cover.Low-Pass Filter: The KAC-9103D has a built-in 24dB/octave low-pass filter that is continuously variable from 50Hz to 200Hz.Bass Boost: The bass boost is adjustable from 0-18dB at 40Hz.Infrasonic Filter: This amp features an 18dB/octave Infrasonic Filter. Ultra-low frequencies that cannot be reproduced by a subwoofer do not become sound but become unnecessary oscillations, which affect sound by causing distortion. These frequencies also waste amplifier power and can cause damage to speakers. Setting the Infrasonic filter switch to 15Hz or 25Hz cuts the frequencies below the respective frequency to improve the reproduction performance of the speakers by eliminating harmful distortion.Phase Inverter: The amp has a switch that allows you to invert the phase of the speaker output. You can select 0° or 180°.Line Level Inputs: The RCA type line-level inputs have a gain (Input Sensitivity) control. The Input Sensitivity control will accept an input signal of 200mV to 5.0 Volts.Speaker Level Input: The KAC-9103D comes with a speaker level input harness. This feature makes it easier to add an amplifier to a factory radio or to a receiver with no preamp outputs.Line Level Output: The amplifier has a set of line level outputs for feeding a full-range stereo signal to another amplifier. It is the same signal that is input through the line inputs. The amplifier's crossovers have no effect on the line level output signal.Fan: There is a fan on top of the amp to help dissipate heat and ensure cool, reliable operation. There is a blue-LED that illuminates next to the fan when power is supplied to the amp.Power Indicator: When the power is turned on to the amplifier, the Power indicator will light up. This indicator will turn off with the amplifier and will turn off if the amplifier goes into protect mode.Protection circuitry: The amplifier features protection circuits that will turn the amp off in case of the following events to protect the amplifier and your speakers:Speaker output contacts groundSpeaker wire short-circuitsUnit malfunctions and DC is sent to speaker outputInternal temperature is too highLoss of ground
Fitness fanatics should reach for the mustard and NOT spinach if they want to look like PopeyeFitness fanatics looking to build muscle should consider reaching for the mustard, a study has found.The steroid homobrassinolide, found in the mustard plant, increases muscle mass, the size of muscle fibres and appetite, research suggests.In addition, the effect when tested on rats was similar to anabolic steroids, which promote the growth of muscle and which are used illegally by athletes to improve performance.Spinach is out, and mustard is in as one way to build your muscle strength, according to a new studyA team of scientists exposed rat muscle cells to different amounts of homobrassinolide and measured protein synthesis – the process in which cells build proteins – in cell culture. The result was increased production – vital for building muscles – and decreased breakdown of protein in the cells.Researcher Dr Slavo Komarnytsky, at North Carolina State University, said: 'We hope that one day brassinosteroids may provide an effective, natural, and safe alternative for age and disease-associated muscle loss, or be used to improve endurance and physical performance.''Because some plants we eat contain these compounds, like mustards, in the future we may be able to breed or engineer these plants for higher brassinosteroid content, thus producing functional foods that can treat or prevent diseases and increase physical performance.'Old school: Cartoon character Popeye missed a trick on not including mustard in his strength-dietDr Gerald Weissmann, editor of the FASEB Journal, in which the study was published, added: ' The temptation is to see this discovery as another quick fix to help you go from fat to fit, and to a very small degree, this may be true.'This study identifies an important drug target for a wide range of conditions that cause muscle wasting.'During the research healthy rats then received an oral dose of homobrassinolide daily for 24 days and changes in body weight, food consumption and body consumption were measured.Rats receiving the steroid gained more weight and slightly increased their food intake.Body composition was measured and showed increased lean body mass in the animals treated.This study was repeated in rats fed high protein diets and similar results were seen.
Story highlights China says U.S. anti-missile plans don't "help to solve the issue"North Korea has recently threatened to attack South Korea and the United StatesThe Pentagon plans to add missile interceptors on the West CoastThe United States' plans to beef up its missile defenses against North Korea are likely to inflame tensions that are running high over Pyongyang's nuclear program, China said Monday."Bolstering missile defenses will only intensify antagonism, and it doesn't help to solve the issue," Hong Lei, a spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said at a regular news briefing in Beijing.The United States will deploy additional ground-based missile interceptors on the West Coast as part of efforts to enhance the nation's ability to defend itself from attack by North Korea, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel announced Friday.The U.S. announcement came after North Korea recently threatened a pre-emptive nuclear attack on South Korea and the United States in response to stepped-up U.N. Security Council sanctions over its latest nuclear test last month.The threat from the regime of young leader Kim Jong Un was part of a recent barrage of vitriolic statements, which included a vow to nullify the armistice agreement that stopped the Korean War in 1953.Photos: Kim Jong Un and North Korea's military Photos: Kim Jong Un and North Korea's military North Korean leader Kim Jong Un meets with North Korea's first female fighter jet pilots in this undated photo released by the country's state media on Monday, June 22.

Roman Polak didn't want his teammates to visit. The big scowling Czech defenceman was lying in a hospital bed, drifting in the fog delivered by his post-surgery painkillers. He is pretty sure he didn't have a TV, but he had a laptop ... yes, he definitely had a laptop. When asked about those five or six days, he can't remember much of what he did. But he remembers that he didn't want his teammates to see him like that. That stuck.It's been a long, slow, painful recovery for Leaf blueliner Roman Polak. ( Graig Abel / Getty Images )"They had a tough schedule, and I didn't want them to see me, there," says Polak now, five months after 13 screws were installed to repair the broken leg he suffered in Game 2 of the Toronto Maple Leafs' first-round series against Washington. "I'd rather stay by myself. I don't know. I didn't feel good after the surgery, and it was painful, and I didn't want anybody to see me as I'm laying there in the bed, you know, struggling. I don't like that." He almost stumbles, the big tough guy, before a grin pushes his heavy, permanently five o'clock-shadowed cheeks to the side. "And I was on drugs too, so mostly I was just high. I probably wouldn't remember it."Article Continued BelowPolak is in camp for the Leafs, and you can tell. In one drill at a morning skate before Tuesday's pre-season loss to Ottawa he pokes at centre Dominic Moore, and knocks down Patrick Marleau. He is also part of what might be the last generation of true smash 'n' bash defencemen. After he cross-checked Connor McDavid during a World Cup warm-up and Auston Matthews retaliated by cross-checking Polak, Polak's assessment of the Matthews hit was, "good technique." "He likes to hit people," says Matthews. "That's what that definitely told me. He actually hit me pretty good earlier that game." And while it's hard to be a basher in a league that gets faster every second, Polak was one of coach Mike Babcock's security blankets last season. But the injury — that half-twirl into the air, the landing — was gruesome, and it's a long road back. Goaltender Frederik Andersen was right next to former Leaf Stephane Robidas when he suffered one of his broken legs, and thought right away this was the same thing. "Well, he's just got to get healthy," says Babcock. "To tell you the truth, I haven't paid any attention to him, until he's in a situation to play in a game, it's just a matter of him on rehab." The night of the injury Polak was devastated: As teammate Nazem Kadri puts it, "he wasn't in good shape." Beyond his emotions, it was the most pain Polak had ever experienced, and that included the time a puck tore through his cheek and he returned to the bench with stitches. As the Leafs landed back in Toronto he felt the cabin pressure squeeze his leg: surgery provided some relief. And that was the start."After three weeks here I went home, and I felt just useless," says Polak. "Because you are on the crutches and playing with the kids or something, and I just can't do anything. So you're there but you're not there, because you just can't help. So basically for my wife I was basically like the third kid." His 5-year-old daughter Isabella would dote on him, bringing him cookies, candy, and drinks; his 2-year-old son Markus delighted in swinging the crutches around. "He was smacking everything," says Polak, with a note of fatherly pride. (He has both their names tattooed in script on his right arm, and once wore matching Halloween costumes with Isabella.) He spent three months on crutches. When the cast came off, he found he was a one-legged man.Article Continued Below"Oh, there was nothing there," said Polak. "The thigh and the calf just disappeared."Roman Polak lies on the ice after being injured during the second period of Game 2 against the Washington Capitals ( Molly Riley/The Associated Press )The rehabilitation clinic is outside his hometown of Ostrava, and it specialized in car crash victims — as Polak puts it, "they teach people to walk again, so they were prepared." He started by walking in the pool. But, uh, Roman ... how did you get there? "Yeah, I shouldn't have been driving," he says, abashed. "But I had a left foot on the brake and the right foot on the gas, and I had to lift

From the NY Times, excerpt "Falser Words Were Never Spoken."…Gandhi's words have been tweaked a little too much in recent years. Perhaps you've noticed a bumper sticker that purports to quote him: "Be the change you wish to see in the world." When you first come across it, this does sound like something Gandhi would have said. But when you think about it a little, it starts to sound more like … a bumper sticker. Displayed brightly on the back of a Prius, it suggests that your responsibilities begin and end with your own behavior. It's apolitical, and a little smug.Sure enough, it turns out there is no reliable documentary evidence for the quotation. The closest verifiable remark we have from Gandhi is this:"If we could change ourselves, the tendencies in the world would also change. As a man changes his own nature, so does the attitude of the world change towards him. … We need not wait to see what others do."Here, Gandhi is telling us that personal and social transformation go hand in hand, but there is no suggestion in his words that personal transformation is enough. In fact, for Gandhi, the struggle to bring about a better world involved not only stringent self-denial and rigorous adherence to the philosophy of nonviolence; it also involved a steady awareness that one person, alone, can't change anything, an awareness that unjust authority can be overturned only by great numbers of people working together with discipline and persistence.When you start to become aware of these bogus quotations, you can't stop finding them…"~Bonus: Gandhi: how to be an effective Activist.

Here are two small tricks that can help if you're making an isometric 2D game in Unity. Ok, so not actually isometric, but that's the term we're used to in videogames, so we'll go with it. These are quite basic and if you're working on such a game you've probably already tackled them your own way. This is our take on it, hopefully it's useful to someone.Sprite OrderingNormally in a 2D game there is no concept of depth, so if you simply place the sprites in the world, you'll most likely have objects appearing in the wrong order than what you'd expect in an isometric game.Thankfully Unity exposes Sorting Layer and Order In Layer properties for Renderers.A quick fix is to set the value of Order in Layer to depend on the Y position of the object.[ExecuteInEditMode] [RequireComponent(typeof(Renderer))] public class DepthSortByY : MonoBehaviour { private const int IsometricRangePerYUnit = 100; void Update() { Renderer renderer = GetComponent(); renderer.sortingOrder = -(int)(transform.position.y * IsometricRangePerYUnit); } }This solves the problem for the simplest case, when we assume all objects rest on the ground.Let's assume we want to have an object that is above the ground in the world, like placing a bird house on that tree. Just trying to place it in the world will treat the pivot of the object as being at ground level, with no way to both place it at a proper height and sort it correctly.There are several options for this. Just to get it out of the system, the first option is to add empty space to the texture below the bird house to make sure the pivot is at ground level (in Unity, the pivot can't be outside of the sprite). This is baaaad! This is wasting texture space, and all instances of that object will need to be at the same height in the game. There are other, less insane, options.One is having a height property in the DepthSortByY behavior and subtract it from transform.position.y when computing the sorting order.Another solution (which we went with) is allowing the DepthSortByY behavior to make the depth computation based on another object's transform. This way, the objects will be considered to be at the same point in space as their target and they'll have the same depth order, even if they're at different Y positions in the scene. In the bird house example, the bird house uses the tree's world position for its depth computations.This solution works better for our game, because it allows artists to move the item freely while staying at the depth (and not have to deal with editing the "height" parameter). And mainly because all the gameplay takes place in the ground's 2D plane anyway so all objects are guaranteed to have a root object that has the ground position. In your own game, it might be easier to just use the first option.[ExecuteInEditMode] [RequireComponent(typeof(Renderer))] public class IsometricObject : MonoBehaviour { private const int IsometricRangePerYUnit = 100; [Tooltip("Will use this object to compute z-order")] public Transform Target; [Tooltip("Use this to offset the object slightly in front or behind the Target object")] public int TargetOffset = 0; void Update() { if (Target == null) Target = transform; Renderer renderer = GetComponent(); renderer.sortingOrder = -(int)(Target.position.y * IsometricRangePerYUnit) + TargetOffset; } }This is how this example is set up in Unity:And this is how it behaves in practice:Ground ProjectionFor certain visual elements and effect, we wanted them to look properly projected on the ground, but also not spend too much time on making art for them. The 'isometric' view of the game means that anything that is horizontally on the ground should look squashed vertically.For simple sprites, this is quite easy. Just draw them directly with the correct perspective and place them in the game.Things get more complicated when you need something that should be able to rotate in any direction. Like something to show the direction the character is moving in, or some visual effect sweeping the ground towards your attacking direction. Especially if these are things that are animated, drawing them manually for all possible orientations is out of the question (or so the artists claim).Our solution is: the artists draw and animate these effects as if viewed top-down, and the programmers take care of transforming them at runtime to look as if they were projected on the ground. Without any transformation
At first, when considering the possible presidential candidacies of Republicans Jeb Bush and Mitt Romney, you might think, "How could these patrician white scions of political families be any more alike?" When you think the word "could," the tone of your voice should bend upward, like a lady in a black-and-white film from the 1950s.So you might be surprised to find out that, in fact, there are several ways in which Bush and Romney—neither of whom have officially confirmed they are running, by the way—are actually quite different from one another. And, if they do decide to run for the Oval Office, these differences will play a major role in determining which becomes the favored choice of all the other patrician white men in the country. Because make no mistake: if the GOP voting bloc is a pie, then Bush and Romney are competing for the exact same slice.FAMILYAs the Republican primary campaign shapes up, both Bush and Romney appear to be the legacy choices available to voters with a mind for the history of our beautiful, bizarre nation. The legacies they represent, though, differ significantly. Mitt's father, George, was elected governor in Michigan three times, by increasingly large margins. That's an improvement on Mitt, who gave up on being governor of Massachusetts after just one term. He left office in 2007 to focus on the first of his (so far) two unsuccessful presidential bids.On the presidential level, Romney made it further than his old man. Though Mitt and George share the same number of failed White House runs, George never won the Republican nomination. He briefly challenged Barry Goldwater in the 1964 primary before withdrawing, then got thrashed by Nixon in 1968, after attributing his previous support for the Vietnam War to "brainwashing."Jeb's family looks a little different. Aside from his father's 1992 re-election campaign, the Bush men have dominated their attempts to hold elected office, both as governors and presidents, a stark contrast with the Romneys. If there's a more dynastic family in the United States than the Bush clan, there are being very quiet about it.RELIGIONAs you know—and if you don't, congratulations on just learning how to walk—Mitt Romney is a Mormon. This does appear to have played a role in voters' conceptions of him; a Pew research poll in 2011 said a remarkable one out of four voters would be less likely to vote for a Mormon candidate.Although you might assume that, like his older brother W., Jeb is a card-carrying evangelical booster, that isn't true. He's actually a Catholic, having converted to his wife's religion two decades ago. This could come in handy appealing to Hispanics, a demo that Republicans have had their eye on for a while, and it will also likely increase his appeal with the evangelical cohort that tends to make up a large percentage of Republican voters. Because Jeb's Catholicism hasn't hurt his social-conservative bonafides—as governor of Florida, he opposed stem-cell research and abortion rights, and famously stepped in to intervene in the 2003 Terri Schiavo case—all of which will make him an acceptable candidate for the far right, even if he isn't Mike Huckabee or Rick Santorum.CONSERVATIVE BONAFIDESOn that note, the big question for both Bush and Romney is whether either is conservative enough to win the Republican nomination. Twice previously, Romney has proven he can twist and warp himself to be palatable enough for his party's conservative base, but not without serious effort and grumbling from the right-wing. In 2008, the man who'd brought socialized healthcare to Massachusetts ran as the party's conservative option, suggesting that he had switched sides on both abortion rights and healthcare, and that he had also championed the war in Iraq. As the Atlantic's David Graham points out, Romney knew he couldn't get to the right of the Tea Party in 2012, so he, focusing on a promise to turn around the country's economy. Graham suggests that Romney's ID in 2016 will be "Compassionate Conservative Champion of the Poor," which, considering his 47 percent speech in 2012, is sort of like Ted Turner going vegetarian.Meanwhile, Bush's positions on social issues may be party-approved, but he has two huge red flags to address. The first is his position on immigration reform, a stance that has become more progressive since leaving the governor's office, particularly in his support for a "pathway to citizenship" for undocumented immigrants. The second is his championing of the Common Core education system, which conservatives hate. Like really, really hate. Nate Silver claims this won't be as big a deal as we might think, but the Breitbarts of the world beg to differ, and if Bush is going to carry his support into the nomination, he'll need to talk the GOP into it.PRIVATE

Men are everywhere. We're the politicians, the church leaders, the business owners and the sports stars.Pick up a paper and the media's full of us, we're the murderers, the rapists, the scandal makers and the crooks.Tune into a random radio phone-in and you'll soon find out what we think about football or politics.You'll see us in the cinema; we're the goodies and the baddies in almost every major film – the protectors and the perpetrators, the cowards and the clowns.So why do we need an International Men's Day ? Are 364 days of patriarchal power and privilege not enough for us?Well, we may always have a point of view about the world outside – and we may still occupy most of the senior positions in the outside world – but what's happening inside men?Twelve of us men will kill ourselves today, in the UK alone, and for each man who dies there will probably be an external factor we can point to, such as a divorce, drug addiction, debt or unemployment.But what's happening inside the dozens of men who die from suicide each week, when the internal pain of living another day becomes greater than the fear of killing yourself?And what's happening inside the rest of us men, those of us who aren't suicidal but still face challenges in life: the overweight, the unemployed, the lonely and the sick? The fathers struggling to connect with their kids, the partners in unhappy or abusive relationships, the stressed-out workers with not enough life in their work-life balance and the low-paid and unemployed men who face the emasculating shame of being a man who can't provide?On the surface men have it all – the jobs, the money, the cars, the clothes, the power, the authority and the free time to play golf, watch football and laugh at Jeremy Clarkson. On the outside men are always acting out – drinking to excess, harassing women in the streets, grooming kids for sex and keeping the police and prison service busy.But what's happening inside men?From the day we are born, we are fed a story that there are only two types of men in the world. Men are either heroes or villains, we're either strong or weak and there is no shade or colour between the black or white choice of being a good man or a bad man.What's it like for men, living within these narrow confines, between a heroic rock and a villainous hard place?Take the daily onslaught of social media campaigns repeatedly telling the world how awful men are to women. How is the average man expected to respond?We have two choices – pick a box – hero or villain.Either we step into the protector role, like a good little man and speak out against the bad men ruining the world for our womenfolk – or we're a villain.Men's expected role in the gender war – as in every other war – is to choose a side; goodies or baddies. You either wear the "this is what a feminist looks like t-shirt" or you're a woman-hater; you either fight against the Germans or you're a traitor; you either support Emma Watson's #HeForShe campaign or you're a misogynist or a rape apologist.What's it like for men to have such limited choices – and if men have all the power, why don't we just give ourselves more choice?The challenge we face as men, is that these rigid masculine roles have been locked in place by a silent conspiracy between the socially conservative and progressively liberal.The sexist rallying cry of traditionalists has long been "women and children first"; for the liberal feminists, their sexist motto is "women and girls first". Can you see who's missing from both of those slogans? It's the invisible gender in both his forms – the good man and bad man.Who puts women and children first? It's the good man. Who do women and girls need protecting from? It's the bad man.When William Hague was still Foreign Secretary, he made an official announcement that "all men" should feel shame about war crimes against women – and to fail to do so was "unmanly". That's right male citizens – you're either a good man feeling shame or bad "unmanly" man – pick a box.So what's happening inside of the nation's men when we are repeatedly called upon to pick a box? Goodie or Baddie? Hero or Villain? Perpetrator or Protector?The truth is, most of us are neither good nor bad. Most men are somewhere in the middle of the statistical bell curve that defines the male population.Most men are not murderers, rapists, wife beaters or street harassers. Most men are not politicians, church leaders,
State officials in West Virginia have filed a civil rights lawsuit against a middle school, alleging that it covered up the sexual assault of at least two girls by two male students who are relatives of employees of the school district.The compaint alleges that the two boys sexually assaulted several female students repeatedly. When the students sought punishment for the offenders, members of the Burch middle school administration attempted to conceal the case and threatened the girls with discipline and, in some cases, also took retaliatory action against them.The state attorney general, Patrick Morrisey, filed a suit in the Mingo county circuit court on Thursday against the Mingo county board of education, five of its employees and the two minors accused of the assault, along with their parents. He said the school has "continued conduct and actions" against the girls since a guidance counsellor was first informed of the accusations in the spring of last year."The two male students have avoided criminal investigation, prosecution, or meaningful punishment due to the actions and conduct of the administrators and teachers at Burch middle school and the Mingo county board of education," Morrisey said in the suit. "Instead of a meaningful investigation by the school, upon information and belief, the female victims have been disparately treated and punished, while the alleged male perpetrators have been 'taken care of'."The school is in Delbarton, West Virginia – a 579-person town less than 10 miles from the Kentucky border, in the heart of West Virginia's coal mining industry.The two boys accused of committing repeated acts of sexual abuse against female students at the middle school are relatives of school district employees. One of the victims said that during one assault, one of the boys told the other: "Don't worry, [your relative] will take care of us."The first victim listed in the complaint did not immediately report the case because of fear and embarrassment, but two other girls, who said they had been abused, told the school guidance counsellor, Hester Keatley, that the victim had been attacked. Keatley, a defendant in the case, questioned the girl and the school principal, Jada Hunter, said she would be calling the girl's mother.The suit states that the two suspects abused the girl on the school's campus and on school buses.The girl told her mother for the first time about the accusations before Hunter's phone call, but did not go into detail about the abuse until later, at which point her mother repeatedly called the principal, who did not reply for several days, eventually calling the mother and telling her "she had taken care of it".A meeting was held with the parents of the victim, the fathers of both male suspects and Melvin Cunningham, a teacher and coach at the school who is also a defendant in the case. One of the fathers said his son had admitted he committed the acts, but Cunningham and Hunter said there were no witnesses so the girl's accusations could not be proven. Both threatened disciplinary action against the girl if she continued to make complaints.During the current semester, the victim shared a class with one of the defendants. On the first day of school, he saw her in class and promptly walked out of the room, the suit says. The victim's schedule was soon changed so she had classes with students in a lower grade.Hunter told the victims' parents she would take action, and told them not to call police. They understood this to mean Hunter was contacting authorities. In March of this year, they learned she had not done so.School policy mandates a call to law enforcement within 48 hours of disclosure of sexual abuse."Every action taken by defendants was either to minimalise the allegations against the boys and/or to protect the alleged male juvenile perpetrators," Morrisey wrote. He also said that relative of one of the boys was "directly involved in the handling and investigation into the allegations against the relative" and in decisions relating to his punishment.Morrisey called the school's investigation "ineffective, non-existent and/or designed to elicit contradictory and/or less incriminating statements from the females."The other victim in the suit, a 13-year-old girl, was subjected to sexual abuse in the school's computer lab, where she sat next to the boys. Another attack occurred on a field trip, where she was "forcibly penetrated".The day after she was first questioned by police, in April, middle school administrators cited her for "bullying" after she had blocked her Facebook account from a niece of a teacher at the school. A day later, she was written up again for "insubordination".On 24 April, Melissa Webb, the middle school's current principal and a defendant in the case, blocked a trooper from taking another victim's statement.The injunction seeks to block the defendants from intervening in the state's ongoing criminal
PORTLAND, Ore. February 1, 2012. Yellow-cedar, a culturally and economically valuable tree in southeastern Alaska and adjacent parts of British Columbia, has been dying off across large expanses of these areas for the past 100 years. But no one could say why--until now."The cause of tree death, called yellow-cedar decline, is now known to be a form of root freezing that occurs during cold weather in late winter and early spring, but only when snow is not present on the ground," explains Pacific Northwest Research Station scientist Paul Hennon, co-lead of a synthesis paper recently published in the February issue of the journal BioScience. "When present, snow protects the fine, shallow roots from extreme soil temperatures. The shallow rooting of yellow-cedar, early spring growth, and its unique vulnerability to freezing injury also contribute to this problem."Yellow-cedar decline affects about 60 to 70 percent of trees in forests covering 600,000 acres in Alaska and British Columbia. The paper, "Shifting Climate, Altered Niche, and a Dynamic Conservation Strategy for Yellow-Cedar in the North Pacific Coastal Rainforest," summarizes 30 years of research and offers a framework for a conservation strategy for yellow-cedar in Alaska.Some key findings include:The complex cause of yellow-cedar decline is related to reduced snow, site and stand characteristics, shallow rooting, and the unique vulnerability of the roots to freezing in low temperatures.Low snow levels and poor soil drainage lead to impact root injury and the eventual death of yellow-cedar trees. The tree thrives in wet soils, but its tendency to produce shallow roots to access nitrogen on these sites made it more vulnerable when spring snow levels were reduced by climate warming.Yellow-cedar health depends on changing snow patterns, thus locations for appropriate conservation and management activities need to follow the shifting snow patterns on the landscape.Some responses to shifting climate are expected to be complex and difficult to anticipate. Long-term multidisciplinary research was needed to determine the true role of climate in the health of yellow-cedar and untangle it from other processes and natural cycles in forests.The yellow-cedar is a slow-growing tree; many are 700 to 1,200 years old. The tree has long been culturally significant to Native Alaskans who use it to make paddles, masks, dishes, and woven items. The wood is also very valuable commercially (for home and boat building) because of its straight grain, durability, and resistance to insects.Attention is now directed toward a solution to protect and manage yellow-cedar, as coastal Alaska is expected to experience less snow but a persistence of periodic cold weather events in the future.Scientists are working with partners in the Alaska Region of the Forest Service to use this new information as the framework for a comprehensive conservation strategy for yellow-cedar in Alaska in the context of a changing climate."We also have ongoing projects with colleagues in the Tongass National Forest in Alaska on planting and thinning to favor yellow-cedar on suitable habitat," adds co-lead author and station scientist Dave D'Amore, "especially on well-drained productive soils where most of the commercial forestry exits. Silvicultural techniques can be used to nudge the ecological niche of yellow-cedar, making it more competitive on these favorable sites."###Other coauthors of the synthesis are Paul Schaberg, U.S. Forest Service, Northern Research Station; Dustin Wittwer, U.S. Forest Service, Alaska Region; and Colin Shanley, The Nature Conservancy.

A recent survey found that 67% of the Americans polled had a favorable view of Microsoft. It's too bad the question was so vague, I'd like to know if that same percentage trusts Microsoft without any reservations. In general, the coverage of the court findings in the Microsoft case have not mentioned any of the facts that led Judge Jackson to rule against Microsoft. So I thought it might be a good idea to go over some of the specific allegations against Microsoft that have been ignored in most discussions. Rather than going through them all, and there are plenty, I'll concentrate most on Microsoft's campaign to squash an one of their competitors in the early 1990's, Digital Research Inc. To set the scene, I'd like to take a stroll down memory lane. As someone who lived through this seemingly early phase in computer history, I am recalling this from memory, so bear with me. Back in the days when computers were not rated solely by MHz, but also by which Intel processor they had in them, a single office might have "286", "386" and "486" computers in them all at the same time. Windows 2.something was out, and it ran on top of DOS 4. At that time, basically the early 1990's, Windows was not a clear standard operating system. However, it was a step in the right direction, and it ran neatly on top of DOS (disk operating system), which was the operating system that all PCs used back then. IBM had a faltering version of DOS (IBM DOS), Microsoft has it's version (MS DOS), and a new star on the scene, Digital Research Inc., had come up with a new and improved version of DOS, known as DR DOS. The problem with DOS back then was the infamous 640Kb memory barrier, and how to use extended or expanded memory for applications larger than 640Kb. There was a heck of a lot of idle memory in PCs at that time, and people were looking for ways to use that extra memory, other than setting up a "RAM-drive". Digital Research was about to release a new version of DOS, "DR DOS 6", and Microsoft was very worried. According to Microsoft's own documents and internal email messages, DR DOS 5 was a superior product to their own upcoming "MS DOS 5", it was cheaper, and it would be out first. At that point, they began a campaign to flood the information channels with hype about MS DOS 5, and how it had advanced memory management, and was superior to all other products. This is standard business practice, but what followed, as outlined in Microsoft's own internal documents and memos, went far beyond that. Microsoft released MS DOS 5 in 1991 and Windows 3.1 in 1992. They were both big hits. DR DOS 6 was coming out, and was considered a superior product by many power users, and sold well. Then owners of DR DOS started getting error messages when they tried to install Windows 3.1 on their systems. It turns out that the developers of Windows were instructed to "make sure DR DOS has problems with Windows". The following are selected Microsoft emails that were entered into evidence in the trial. Microsoft's David Cole emailed Phil Barrett on September 30 1991: "It's pretty clear we need to make sure Windows 3.1 only runs on top of MS DOS or an OEM version of it," and "The approach we will take is to detect DR DOS 6 and refuse to load. The error message should be something like 'Invalid device driver interface." Microsoft had several methods of detecting and sabotaging DR-DOS with Windows. One was to have Smartdrive detect DR-DOS and refused to load it for Windows 3.1. There was also a version check in XMS in the Windows 3.1 setup program which produced the message: "The XMS driver you have installed is not compatible with Windows. You must remove it before setup can successfully install Windows." This was not true, but rather, was an attempt to undermine the competition. Brad Silverberg, the Microsoft exec who had been responsible for Windows 95, emailed Jim Allchin (now Senior Vice President of MS) on September 27th 1991: "after IBM announces support for dr-dos at comdex, it's a small step for them to also announce they will be selling netware lite, maybe sometime soon thereafter. but count on it. We don't know precisely what ibm is going to announce. my best hunch is that they will offer dr-dos as the preferred solution for 286, os 2 2.0 for 386. they will also probably continue to offer msdos at $165 (drdos for $99). drdos has problems running windows today, and I assume will have more problems in the future." Jim Allchin replied: "You should make sure it has problems in the future. :-)". Andy Hill emailed David Cole, Windows group manager: "Janine has brought up some good questions on how we handle the error messages that the users will get if they aren't using MS-DOS.
Pope Francis Has Unsettled MeI'll be honest. I was shocked at what Pope Francis said in an interview published yesterday. I was disturbed because I knew that his comments would be used against pro-life and traditional marriage activists. I knew that sidewalk counselors would be told by those supporting abortion that the pope told them not to be "obsessed" with abortion. Traditional marriage supporters would also be told that the pope said, "Who are you to judge?"I'll be honest, I was disturbed. While it's clear that the pope is not changing Church teaching he is clearly changing the emphasis. The pope with a few words has unsettled so much. With a few words the pope has unsettled me.But I thought and prayed about it yesterday and finally came to the realization that maybe that's not such a terrible thing. The Catholic faith was never meant to be a settled one. We are called to light the world on fire with love. And I wondered if this was a moment to afford me the opportunity to consider my faith differently. To deepen it. I know that I can be guilty of being a bit abrasive and mocking towards those who disagree with the Church's teaching on life and marriage.Smarter people than me can tell you what the pope was saying but what I took from it was that the pope was telling us that there is so much more to the faith than the anti-abortion movement and the defense of marriage. He wasn't discounting them, but he was inviting us to a deeper understanding of the faith. Our faith is not an either/or. We are called to live in the fullness of the gospel.We are called to love everyone. Everyone. And I think that's something I need to work on. It's not enough to be right. We're called to love. It's much harder.I think the pope was reminding us that we are a religion of "yes." It's like when you get married your "I do" is also an "I never will" to millions of women on the planet. But that's, of course, not what we focus on.This pope has unsettled me. And I am grateful.
In response to an article from Daily Beast reporter Yashar Ali published on October 26, Green Party presidential candidate Dr. Jill Stein challenged "the willful misinformation and manipulative framing" of the Daily Beast article as "a blatant smear attack and hypocritical attempt to suggest conflicts of interest in my environmental and economic justice-focused campaign."Dr. Stein noted: "If Mr. Ali is truly interested in conflicts of interest of political candidates and their families, where is his disclosure on the conflict of interest posed by Chelsea Clinton's position as a director of the corporate owner of the Daily Beast, IAC? He has created an imagined conflict of interest, perhaps to distract from the very real, harmful conflicts of interest in the Clintons' pay-to-play schemes, back-room fundraising, and quarter-million dollar speeches for the predatory banks, health insurance industry, and fossil fuel tycoons, who have directly benefited from Hillary Clinton's policy record as Senator and Secretary of State, as well as from Bill Clinton's actions as President."Mr. Ali has failed to show a conflict of interest in Dr. Stein's investments, as her policy positions have consistently opposed the interests of the companies that form a portion of most index and mutual fund profiles. By his logic, he insinuates that the 50 million plus Americans who have retirement accounts invested in mutual and index funds - including school teachers, public workers, and employees of any company that provides such funds to workers as a benefit - can never speak out or organize against corporate abuses. This disingenuous shaming exercise is an effort to silence dissent, and a blunt attempt to bully people into refraining from exercising their democratic rights to free speech and political action.Below is Dr. Stein's full rebuttal to the Daily Beast, which updates her original comment sent prior to publication:Like many Americans who hold retirement accounts, pension funds, or who invest in the American economy, my finances are largely held in index funds or mutual funds over which I have no control in management or decision-making. Sadly, most of these broad investments are as compromised as the American economy - massively degraded as it is by the fossil fuel, defense and finance industries. Over the years I have taken steps to divest from the worst of these holdings - transferring my checking and savings accounts from Bank of America largely to a credit union, and divesting from GE, Dupont and Merck stocks I had been given decades ago.While I have explored "green" mutual funds, I found their investments in fracking and large scale biofuels not much better than the non-green funds. I have not yet found the mutual funds that represent my goals of advancing the cause of people, planet and peace. Admittedly I have not spent a lot of time researching elusive ethical investments. I prefer using my time fighting for social, economic and ecological transformation, and recycling capitalist money into the fight to do so.I was fortunate to have inherited over a half-million dollars from my parents. I have used this resource to help build the social and political movements needed for transformative change. I used this money to jump start my presidential campaigns in 2016 and 2012, statewide campaigns before that, and to help build the Green Party -- because, unfortunately, the most green, just investments won't count for squat if the corporations and the super rich funding the Democrats and Republicans are still calling the shots. I also used this money to support my work with radical non profits, including the Massachusetts Coalition for Healthy Communities, and the Global Climate Convergence.Of note, my husband and I hold separate investments that reflect somewhat different approaches to money management. These separate holdings are reported as such in my FEC filing.Participating in the American economy by holding investments in mutual funds, retirement accounts, and index funds is a far cry from the Clintons' back room fundraising and quarter-million dollar speeches for the predatory banks, health insurance industry, and fossil fuel tycoons. It's also a world apart from the predatory economics, taxpayer bailouts, and tax-dodging of Donald Trump. To the contrary, these investments are what tens of millions of working Americans must do to secure crucial resources for retirement.To suggest an equivalence betrays either mind-boggling cluelessness, or more likely, the attack-dog mentality of the Clinton-protection press, hitting on true proponents of social change in order to defend the precarious empire of the political elite.The Daily Beast is suggesting that participating in the American economy is incompatible with working to change it. This is comparable to the position taken by anti-climate change press (like at Fox news) who say that riding in a car or airplane means you cannot criticize fossil fuels. Unfortunately, to change public policy, one must participate in the economy enough to generate the resources to create change, ideally in a way that minimizes damage and maximizes change.We need real options for ethical investing, including investments in the cooperative economy. Retirement security should be a human right, guaranteed through expanded Social

Gabbiadini's future has yet to be decided and is currently in stand by. At the moment a sale seems to be blocked because Napoli is not intent on selling him until they have secured a replacement. Fiorentina would like 15 million on top of Gabbiadini and this has been considered too much by Napoli.His future is still up in the air as Everton make a rebound offer of 23 million. Napoli has already said no as they refuse without having an alternative and having secured a substitute as there is still no deal with Fiorentina for Kalinic. The azzurri aren't accepting, Gabbiadini's future is still up for grabs.@EddieBenedetti
Kudzu and the California Marriage Amendmentby Rick MoenAugust 25, 2008(last updated August 6, 2018)This past century, large portions of the American South have been consumed by an unintended side-effect.I refer to the infamous "kudzu" vine, imported from Japan for its stunning erosion-control properties. This tactic worked: Crumbling riverbanks and hillsides were stabilized all over the South — but, then, everyone realized with mounting horror that this hardy legume is almost completely unstoppable anywhere protected from hard freezes, growing at the awesome rate of a foot per night and reaching heights of 100 feet. Entire abandoned houses have been observed to vanish under a kudzu carpet, over a summer growing season. It's now considered a pest; sometimes, an outright menace.The plant can be used with caution, where its invasive side-effect is known and planned for — but the point is that it was deployed without understanding its full effects.Laws' side-effects, likewise, can render them self-defeating (though, on the bright side, bad laws are easier to eradicate than kudzu): I'm going to explain, below, why recently popular marriage-definition legislation like California's November 2008 "California Marriage Protection Act" (an initiative state-constitutional amendment) creates kudzu-class unintended side effects its proponents haven't anticipated and will find horrific — in that they're going to end up mandating and legally sanctifying exactly the sort of same-sex marriages they're intending to ban.Please note: Yr. humble author is deliberately avoiding the question of whether same-sex marriage is desirable, an offense against God, and so on. (For what it's worth, said author is a heterosexual genetic male, happily and monogamously married to qty. one (1) heterosexual genetic female. So, this essay is not a sneaky ploy to induce gender confusion in unwary citizens.) It's not that I don't have opinions on that contentious question. It's just that they're not relevant to what I'm writing about.In short: I'm going to show that recent legislation restricting marriage to "a man and a woman" — regardless of whether you consider that effort good, bad, or indifferent — is going to produce harmful, unintended side effects (maybe even for you, your family, your friends, and so on), exactly the opposite of what proponents intend.I'll not be moralizing, and this isn't lobbying from the "intersex" movement or anyone else. I'm just a regular hetero guy, quietly telling you what's starting to happen, why, and how to see for yourself. OK?Marriage Protection Meets BiologyHere's the sort of law we're talking about:Proposition 8Eliminates Right of Same-Sex Couples to Marry: Initiative Constitutional Amendment SECTION I. Title This measure shall be known and may be cited as the "California Marriage Protection Act." SECTION 2. Article I. Section 7.5 is added to the California Constitution, to read: Sec. 7.5. Only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California.Now, that's simple and should have predictable, orderly results, right? I'll bet the Soil Conservation Service guys in the 1950s thought that about kudzu, too.The biggest problem is that laws like the California initiative will make the courts decide who is male and who is female — and all available decision criteria create unavoidable miscarriages of justice that will, or should, dismay initiative proponents.You're probably thinking, about now, that I'm going to exaggerate the sex-definitional1 problem: Probably, you and everyone you know is unambiguously male or female — or at least has always believed himself or herself to be so, and nobody's challenged that, and nobody's likely to.That's true, absolutely: Only maybe one live birth in 100 has some non-standard sex anatomy, and genetic anomalies are slightly rarer than that. However, let's talk about those 1-in-100 or 1-in-1000 cases — because those could be you, or your aunt, or your best friend — and because our system of law has to deal with 1-in-1000 situations, too.An illustrative example: Let's say you're an adult woman. You were always female; you never had any doubts about this. You have all the right parts and none of the wrong ones; you think of yourself as a gal. You get married. (Yes, I do mean to a man.) Somewhere down the road, your genes get tested: To your astonishment, it says you're not only not XX (double-X being the classic female chromosome pairing), but in fact XY (classic male chromosomes). Testing shows your blood to be loaded with
Dear Parent of the Average Child,I'm sorry. Your child is wonderful.  She is always at school on time, does her homework most everyday, works well on her own and is patient with those around her.  I really wanted  to go tell your daughter how proud of her I was of the work she was doing today.I was about to but you see I had a young girl  over in the corner crying because she hadn't had breakfast. Another was tromping around the classroom in winter boots. It's May. When I asked her to change she told me she didn't have any other shoes. I needed to send them and my CEA down to the office to see if we had some food and any extra shoes in lost and found. Oh and over in the other corner there was a  boy screaming at the top of his lungs because, well no one is sure why. He is on a list to see a specialist, they hope to have a plan in place for him soon. Of course it has been 3 months, but the specialist teacher is overworked and only at our school a few days a week so we have to be patient. More children trickled in. One girl told me that her backpack is at Mom's but she was at Dad's last night. He forgot to send a lunch. She also wanted to tell me about her Dad's new girlfriend but she told me I wasn't  to tell mom because it's was secret.  A young man tells me his cat died last night. Another lost a tooth! Exciting until he sees the blood, thenthe fear sets in.A child came in a little late looking afraid and tentative. She watched carefully what was going on but was too afraid to join in.  Everyone agrees that the child's fears aren't normal and that she needs some counselling but there are only so many hours in a day. They might be able to see her for one or two sessions next month. I started to head over to help her. Your daughter, wonderful child that she is, helps her put away her things and leds her to her desk. I was about to head over and say thank you but I notice 3 boys in the corner playing rough. I ran over to stop them and have a conversation about expected behaviour at school. I also tried to throw in a lesson on non-violence while I was at it.I turned back to look for your daughter. I haven't forgotten that I wanted to check in with her but I look up and realise I should probably begin teaching the lesson of the day. I told myself I would check in with her later. This was all before 9am. Many other things  happened during the day that made it very difficult for me to check in with your wonderful daughter.  Students with learning disabilities, diagnosed and not diagnosed. Students with special needs and with behaviour problems. Students who are needier or put up their hand more often. Students who yell louder.I realised after a day of running from child to child and crisis to crisis, I never did get a chance to check-in with her today. I don't mean to leave your daughter alone but she seems to be doing just fine without me. I hope it is true. I'm sorry. I feel terrible. Would you mind telling her how proud I am of her? Let her know I appreciate her? I will check-in with her tomorrow.From Your Child's TeacherAuthors Note:I have 23 little treasures in my room. I care about them all. I want to teach them all and see them all succeed. I've had more days like this one than I would like to admit. When I think about a classroom without class limits or I think about a school system with even less specialist teachers and less services for our students, I worry. I wonder how many average kids go unseen everyday. I honestly don't think I can do this job under those conditions. Somedays I wonder how I do it now.  I know for a fact I won't be able to do it well.  Please, please please understand how important this issue is.  I didn't become a teacher for the paycheck or the glory. I became a teacher because I wanted to help kids do amazing things with their lives.  I want that for all my students. I want to do my job well. That means that I need the tools to do that. This includes a reasonable class size and help from specialist teachers. That is why I'm willing to take a 10% pay cut and walk out inspite of the threats. For me isn't about the money. Its about the kids.
SARAH FERGUSON, PRESENTER: After a series of scandals, the live animal export trade is supposed to be enjoying a boost, with strong support from the new government and the recent reopening of key markets in the Middle East.But now there are allegations that some rogue traders may be putting the whole industry at risk.A 7.30 investigation has discovered a trail of paperwork suggesting export documents may have been falsified, flouting strict national and international laws designed to protect countries from importing diseased animals.We've also uncovered evidence that one of Australia's biggest exporters may be breaching the system set up just three years ago to protect Australian animals overseas.The Australian Department of Agriculture is now investigating these allegations and has formally requested 7.30 hand over evidence obtained for this story.Matt Peacock has this exclusive report, which contains some confronting imagesMATT PEACOCK, REPORTER: Once again this month, Australian livestock is being transported to Bahrain and Egypt, following long suspensions of a trade that's been dogged by controversy.But now 7.30 has uncovered possible criminal conduct at the heart of the industry. There is evidence to suggest that key export documents have been falsified.MELISSA PARKE, LABOR MP FOR FREMANTLE: Well I think that if there has been doctoring of any documents, then the full force of the law should be brought to bear on that. That's criminal action.MATT PEACOCK: After the trade to Indonesia was suspended three years ago, new rules called the Exporter Supply Chain Assurance System, or ESCAS, were introduced, which hold exporters responsible for animal welfare all the way from the farm through to an approved abattoir overseas.BARNABY JOYCE, MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE: This system tries to balance the needs of having a trade that brings a fair return back to Australian farmers and the desire by the Australian people to have animals treated humanely.MATT PEACOCK: But 7.30 can reveal a major breakdown in the system, with possible breaches of the law and claims by animal welfare advocates that a Perth-based exporter, Livestock Shipping Services, or LSS, is flouting the rules, leading to ongoing cruelty against Australian animals.It's here in this office in a quiet suburban backstreet in Perth that LSS is based and I've been trying to get an interview with its live export manager, Gary Robinson - so far, to no avail. But Mr Robinson has expressed in other media interviews his contempt for the ESCAS process.GARY ROBINSON, GM, LIVESTOCK SHIPPING SERVICES (ABC Radio, 15 Oct. 2013): It's failing exporters because exporters can't operate their business properly. It's failing producers because producers are receiving half the price that they should be receiving for their livestock. It's failing our customers because they are offended that the Australian Government wants to apply these rules on them.MATT PEACOCK: Gary Robinson is no stranger to controversy. 18 months ago, he was Middle East manager for another major exporter, Wellard, and was involved in one of the most infamous incidents in the history of the live export trade.Wellard's ship, the Ocean Drover, was refused permission to unload in Bahrain after authorities there declared the sheep onboard were diseased. It was a claim that was later disproven. Wellard diverted its shipment to Pakistan. But once the Pakistan Government realised Bahrain had rejected the shipment, it moved in to conduct a brutal cull.Pakistan, on that trip, I remember you stated afterwards that it was horrible, that it was appalling to see.MAURO BALZARINI, CEO, WELLARD: One of the worst thing in my life, definitely. It was touching for me as well. Very - I took it very personally.MATT PEACOCK: 7.30 has now discovered that the documents used to gain permission to land the sheep in Pakistan appear to have been falsified.Each export shipment needs a Certificate of Australian Origin, in Perth, issued here at the Fremantle Chamber of Commerce. Certificates have a series of stamps and signatures to prove their authenticity.The problem is that we've got this document which, unlike your stamp, it doesn't have the date below it. And also up here, it's a written number, but you do what? You put a stamp on that, don't you?VICTORIA WILLETTS, FREMANTLE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE: We do, yes.MATT PEACOCK: According to the Chamber of Commerce, the certificate was never authorised.So that's a stamp there, compared to this where it's just been written in.

Mike Rogers: 'Hundreds' of Americans with ISIL connectionsThe chairman of the House Intelligence Committee says hundreds of Americans are known to have associated with the Islamic militant group fighting in Iraq and Syria.Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Mich.) said on "Fox News Sunday" that it's hard to track all Americans who have traveled to join the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant but that the intelligence community is following everyone it can identify."The problem is there is no sure number," he said. "It's in the hundreds that we believe have at least [at] one time traveled and participated and trained with them."(Also on POLITICO: Rogers: 'Don't do stupid stuff' isn't working)Rogers said the United States does have good legal tools to hinder citizens who are known associates of the group."We have a law on the books; we should use it, and we should be aggressive in using it," he said, referring to the material support of terrorism statute.As ISIL grows in Syria and Iraq, Western nations have become increasingly concerned that citizens who train with the jihadist group will use their passports to return home and recruit or carry out an attack. British Prime Minister David Cameron announced increased security measures for his country Friday and said he would propose measures to make it easier to revoke passports for British citizens with ties to terrorist groups.Rogers called on President Barack Obama to take stronger action against ISIL to make sure it can't recruit Americans and get its members into the United States."ISIL would like to have a Western-style attack to continue this notion that they are the leading jihadist group in the world," Rogers said.
His children use the "modern art installation" as an impromptu goal, but it also serves as a reminder of the constant need for the Prime Minister to keep thinking of radical solutions to the unprecedented economic and political challenges he faces.Many in his own party are increasingly of the opinion that Downing Street and the Government's key figures may be failing to rise to the challenge.Britain is back in recession and the crisis in the euro looks likely to condemn this country to a lost economic decade. Mr Cameron does not "see a time" when the austerity programme will end.The budget was regarded as a presentational disaster and George Osborne, the Prime Minister's key lieutenant and ally, is facing questions over his position that seemed unthinkable last year.Mr Cameron is struggling to persuade even his own MPs to support government policy and there is a growing clamour for a more Right-wing agenda.The relationship with the Liberal Democrats appears to be in a state of permanent limbo with relaunches for the Coalition an almost monthly occurrence. After a frenetic first 18 months bringing radical new policies for welfare, schools and health, Downing Street aides talk of "mid-term blues" as Labour remain consistently ten points ahead in the polls.TORY DISQUIET WITH THE LIB DEMSMr Cameron says he understands the grumbling and that even he becomes "frustrated" that he cannot always get his own way. But he urges his supporters and the public to give him time to see the fruits of the Coalition's work."If you're in government, you don't get everything you want," he says. "I'm the Prime Minister; I don't get everything I want. Sometimes you have to, we have to, hammer out compromises around the Cabinet table, or in your department. And, if you lose the argument, you have to support the position."Obviously it's been a very tough time to be in government but I think the most important thing is we've given Britain a secure plan for getting out of the debt and the deficit and the difficulties that we inherited."The sense I get of the mood of the British public is of very fair-minded people: they say it's very difficult, they're quite pessimistic about the state of the world and the state of the world economy and their own finances. They know it's tough, they know it's difficult, they know that none of these things are going to be easily done."Mr Cameron appears to have some sympathy for the dozens of Conservative MPs who defied the whips to vote against policy on Lords reform and Europe.Although the rebels are highly unlikely to be offered government jobs in the reshuffle expected this autumn, the Prime Minister indicates that their careers have not been forever blighted."If no one who ever voted against the Government [got a] ministerial office ... [Iain] Duncan-Smith wouldn't be in the Cabinet. I think politics has changed, there are people who come with more strong and independent views. It's difficult in coalition because sometimes you're coming forward with proposals that your coalition partners are more enthusiastic about than you are." The comments are likely to intensify Lib Dem suspicions that the Prime Minister is not really intent on a hard-line approach to ensure that the Coalition's policy deals become reality.THE FUTURE OF THE COALITIONMr Cameron has obviously been dedicating a lot of time to thinking about the changing nature, and possibly form, of the Coalition over the next three years. Key decisions on airports, wind farm subsidies and social care have been delayed in recent weeks, and future assumptions about how the relationship will function are being reconsidered.For example, the Coalition was due to agree a programme for public spending from 2014 to 2017. Discussions are due to begin later this year or early next year, but the prospect of a wide-ranging, three-year deal now seems remote. Instead, the Prime Minister suggests a shorter agreement may be under consideration."We talked about the need to have one. But how many years it runs for, how exactly it works, we're going to spend more time talking about that. I think what matters is taking the big decisions about the future. I much prefer to approach it from the decisions, and then work out how we are going to [do it], how many years. I want us to make some very big decisions about housing policy, welfare policy, how we fund infrastructure. Let's work out how these decisions trade off against each other."He also indicates that the Coalition may function differently in the year before an election. His preference is for the current arrangement to run to May 2015. But asked whether it may switch to "confidence and supply", where Lib Dems would not vote to bring the Government down but would not support a policy agenda, he replies: "I think the Coalition will run to 2015. How exactly you separate before an election and fight an election
As the Internet and its younger retarded brother, the social media, slowly enter the deep-end of the pool together, the frequency of 'morally grey situations' starts increasing.This is only natural—for those that know technology (the users of the Internet) cannot see beyond it, and those who do not know technology (the users of social media) cannot see into it.So when Sagarika Ghose is bad-mouthed on Twitter and the BBC >covers it with an article titled: "Why are Indian women being attacked on social media?", we should refrain from jumping to certain conclusions.Conclusions like Ms. Ghose's assumption that women abused on Twitter tend to be 'liberal and secular' or that her online abusers must be angry at 'women who speak their mind.' Or even (a BBC-drawn conclusion) that the Indian patriarchal mentality is 'carrying over to the Internet.'While the above statements may be justified, and even correct, the broader aspect of online abuse cannot be as simple as that. It is at, its heart, a clash of civilisations. A battle royale between netizens and the Twitterati.From 1995 to nearly 2005 – 2006, the Internet encouraged free discussion of even the most taboo topics—as in most forums, people were able to wrap a cloak of anonymity around themselves. During this period there was no Facebook, no Twitter. Before the advent of social media and its ilk, a person's online identity could not possibly represent the whole of a person's actual identity! This was because for the most part, people functioned on the Internet under some nickname or the other.Indeed, many of the Internet's earliest communities (IRC, various bulletin board messaging systems etc) were built in such a manner that an individual's personal identity played no role in the functioning of these forums. Indeed, a derivative of this principle was that users were actually discouraged to shed parts of their personal identity to be able to function on these forums. Why was this , you ask? For the simple reason that there was no way to verify ones identity, even if you wanted to reveal it!Rubber duckyThis indirectly led to a different definition of identity itself. You could be Indian, Chinese, American, Russian, gay, straight, male, female—all depending merely on what you fancied on being that day. In fact, this phenomenon became so prevalent; the founder of 4Chan put a word to it. He called it 'fluid identity'. Moving from being one person to the other, nobody could stop you.These principles were embraced, which lead to slurs like f***er, w**re, s**t becoming commonplace. Why? Because the Internet initially, was at its essence, home to basically an anonymous pool of people from around the world.And when you call somebody a w**re, what you are essentially doing is reducing their identity down to the most simplest level. It was commonly assumed that everybody would lie about who they were, and by slandering everyone with an insult, they could move discussion forward from there onwards.Almost how in certain tribal groups, when a boy becomes a man, he is given a new name and then only allowed to lead his life. Similarly, bringing your own ethnicity or political affiliation or orientation of any form to the Internet was simply not necessary - as the Internet would remove it anyway. In some forums, it was considered almost rude to draw attention to yourself in that fashion.And this is what people, who take offense to online abuse, are truly missing. You see that blue, ostentatious check mark symbol next to Sagarika Ghose's Twitter handle?The Twitterati and Facebook personalities who embrace the confirmation of their own real-world identities—and indeed broadcast to the whole Internet that "yes, this is the true Sagarika Ghose" are trying to bring the physical world's notion of identity onto the Internet. And this is where our problem starts.Political scientist Samuel Huntington gained prominence for his theory—t >he Clash of Civilisations— where he postulated that all sources of conflicts in the future would not be ideological, but rather cultural in nature.Identity mismatchAnd do we not see this happening, twenty years later, on the Internet? On the one hand you have the old users of the Internet with notions of fluid identity, and on the other hand you have social media users who wish to reclaim their right to be offended! It is a clash between users of websites with different identifying natures, with different cultures. The point here is that, for users of the old Internet, it is not just Sagarika Ghose who is a s**t, but in that everybody is a s**t.What would be ideal at this point, however, is for both camps to understand each other's stance and together develop a new concept of online identity
ISL 2017: Bengaluru FC beat India U-19 National Team, Daniel Lalhlimpuia scoresThe Blues missed Sunil Chhetri and Udanta Singh, who were busy with national team duty.A near-full strength Bengaluru FC were made to sweat on Friday when they faced a resilient India U-19 national team in a friendly. The Blues won the match 1-0, courtesy Daniel Lalhlimpuia's first half strike.The Indian Super League (ISL) side missed the services of star players Sunil Chhetri, Gurpreet Singh Sandhu and Udanta Singh, who left for Macau along with the national team.The defending champions of the Federation Cup will be facing North Korean side 4:25 SC in the second leg of the AFC Cup semi-final on 13th September, having thrashed them 3-0 in the first leg at home.On the other hand, the India U-19 team also has its hands full, with the SAFF U-18 championship slated to start in a fortnight. With all players born on or after 1st January 1999, the India U-19 team will have the full squad to choose from in the U-18 tournament.India have been grouped with Bangladesh and hosts Bhutan, and will be eager to win their maiden title having finished second best behind Nepal in the inaugural edition.Article continues below"It was a good effort by our young boys, especially against a strong Bengaluru FC who also had foreigners in their line-up," Floyd Pinto, the coach of the U-19 team told Goal after the match.Bengaluru had earlier played two friendlies in Spain during their pre-season tour, but lost 4-2 and 3-0 against UCAM Murcia and Bani Yas respectively.
Update:The Carolina Panthers announced Saturday that they have exercised LB Luke Kuechly fifth-year option in the coming months.———To no surprise, Panthers GM Dave Gettleman told reporters on Tuesday that they will exercise LB Luke Kuechly fifth-year option in the coming months."I'd have to be brain-dead not to," Gettleman said, per Joe Person.Because Kuechly was a top-10 pick back in 2012, his fifth-year option will be based on transition tender for his position, which would be the average salary for the top-10 inside linebackers last year.It's worth mentioning that this tender is guaranteed for injury only, and won't prevent them from working out a long-term contract extension in the coming months.Kuechly, 23, already has a Defensive Player of the Year award and is clearly in the discussion for being the best inside linebacker in the league.Kuechly is entering the final year of his four-year, $12.58 million rookie contract and stands to make a base salary of $2,105,265 for the 2015 season.In 2014, Kuechly recorded 153 tackles, three sacks, one interception, a forced fumble, a recovery and 11 pass defenses for the Panthers. Pro Football Focus has him rated as the N0. 1 inside linebacker out of 60 qualifying players.
When A$AP Rocky sat with director Dexter Navy to flesh out the visual conceit for the rapper's song "L$D," he wanted it to be "trippy.""Whenever a fellow emcee, or a rapper, or somebody puts out a music video that's dope, I'm either hating or inspired," Rocky told TIME. "I really enjoy good visuals."And what better opportunity to experiment with imagery, than with a psychedelic, drug-induced love song about LSD? The music video borrows heavily from Gaspar Noé's 2009 psychedelic fantasy film Enter the Void (which, if you ask Noé, also inspired Kanye West's 2010 music video "All of the Lights")."I watched that film," said Rocky, "and at the end of the day, we wanted to do something that was inspired, that paid homage to it without taking from that storyline or that plot."The Jim Jonsin-produced record is the third single from Rocky's sophomore album, At. Long. Last. ASAP., which debuted at #1 on both the Billboard 200 and the R&B/Hip-Hop charts. This is his second consecutive #1 on the Billboard 200. The Harlem native is currently on a joint tour with Tyler the Creator with special guests Danny Brown and Vince Staples. In January 2015, Rocky's record label founder A$AP Yams died of a drug overdose.
TORONTO, ON - SEPTEMBER 18: Head coach Tom McLellian looks on from the bench while playing Team Finland in the second period during the World Cup of Hockey at the Air Canada Center on September 18, 2016 in Toronto, Canada. (Photo by Gregory Shamus/Getty Images)That sure didn't take long. About as long as McDavid to Matthews to Eichel, turns out, as this Team North America have gone from longshot on the World Cup of Hockey odds board to favoured to knock off Russia in Monday night's feature, and now the third choice to win the whole tournament.That's a pretty staggering turnaround in terms of perception. Online sportsbook Bodog pegged Team North America's 23-and-under young 'uns as 11-to-1 to win the tournament just before it began, with Russia the four-to-1 second choice behind favoured Canada. Earlier in the summer, the kids were as long as 20-to-1.Now, off a pair of contrasting openers - NA was way too much for Finland in their opener, while Russia looked humdrum in losing to Sweden - and the kids are favoured to beat the Russians and go to 2-0 according to the latest odds on Monday's game, and sit right behind Sweden at 4-to-1 to win the tournament, while Russia has dropped to fourth in the reckoning at 9-to-1. In Europe the spread between the Swedes and team NA is a little wider, though not by much.Canada remains odds-on to win, of course, and this one against Russia will doubtless be a much different proposition than the opener. But at least as far as the betting numbers are concerned, the Canada vs. North America final matchup that would warm the cockles of the continent's puckheads, not to mention Gary Bettman, looks very much alive.
Which Spanish language paper should I enrol in?The appropriate entry point for Spanish language papers depends on your current level of Spanish. Each enrolment is ultimately at the discretion of the Spanish Programme, but the following broad guidelines apply.Students who have never studied Spanish or whose experience of Spanish is minimal and dates from many years ago, or who have only completed one year at high school, should enrol for SPAN131. This paper is designed for complete beginners.Students who have studied Spanish for two or three years at high school in the relatively recent past, or have completed SPAN131, should enrol for SPAN132.For students who have completed four to five years at high school, or who have NCEA Level 2 or 3 in Spanish, or an equivalent qualification, SPAN231 or SPAN232 might be the appropriate paper to enrol for. This paper reviews and consolidates the major grammar points from NCEA Levels 2 and 3.eVision does not understand that students may be eligible for a paper such as SPAN132 or SPAN232 on the basis of their prior learning and current level of Spanish - eVision will only see a student who does not have the prerequisite (SPAN131 and SPAN132 respectively) and will require that you seek "Special permission" to enrol in that paper. "Special permission" is easily acquired - email languages@otago.ac.nz if you have any further queries or need assistance with your enrolment.To see the programme requirements for a BA in Spanish, BA(Hons) in Spanish and DipLang in Spanish – click herePapers*Not offered in 2018100 Level Papers200 Level Papers300 Level Papers400 Level Papers (Honours)

However, this is the primary reason Bitcoin is failing. Techno-geeks tend to get wrapped up in the technology -- not the conceptual potential -- and end up talking about topics only a small group of people (other techno-geeks) can understand.To help better explain what Bitcoin actually is, take a $20 dollar bill (or any other amount) out of your wallet and look at it. What is it worth? "Well, $20 dollars of course," is most likely the usual indignant reply. But what does $20 dollars mean? Where does it come from? We all know The Federal Reserve issues all currency for the United States. And then further elucidate on how it becomes $20 dollars. Believe it or not, U.S. currency was created out of thin air. The whole value of our currency is a faith-based system. We all accept the same belief that it has value. And such it is with Bitcoin. All it requires is the belief in it. And as of now, a lot of people believe Bitcoin is about as real as a unicorn.Although technically the Fed can create money out of thin air, the central bank cannot simply print money as it wants. As with anything that has a higher supply than demand, the value will go down. As long as people have faith in a currency, a central bank can issue more of it. Since Bitcoin has no central bank, there will only ever be the capped supply of 21 million bitcoins. That finite amount creates an inherent scarcity within the Bitcoin system, which creates value.Unlike gold, if Bitcoin does fail, it cannot be melted into a pretty piece of jewelry. So whether we are talking about gold or bitcoins, gold only has a higher "store of value" because more people believe it does, and not just because it can be made into something else.In reality, Bitcoin is no different than gold -- a faith-based system with less followers. There is a floor to the value of gold because of that faith, but only from our perceived belief that mining has any value. And if faith-based systems (like religion) have shown us anything, it's that they have an amazing ability to survive regardless of the "reality" that tries to poke holes in its beliefs. However, because this little religion of Bitcoin has fewer followers and leaps-of-faith required to suspend logic, we can decide -- en masse -- not to believe in it. And then Bitcoin is just worth nothing."Didn't that Bitcoin exchange in Japan lose all of those peoples' money? See it is unsafe!" The transparency of Bitcoin is actually far superior to our current banking models. In fact, it is now becoming clear that instead of following basic Bitcoin security and transparency practices, Mt. Gox (the oldest Bitcoin exchange that recently shut down) was operating in an opaque centralized model more akin to existing banking systems. Following the banking model and not the Bitcoin model is what led to its demise.This is where some people, who do not realize how our monetary system works, either get excited with me or want to shut me up for completely frying their synapses.The difference between bitcoins and regular moneyA notable difference between the U.S. monetary system and Bitcoin is that Bitcoin technically has no banking system. As such when people exchange the currency between each other there are no bank fees (or ones so extremely negligible as to have little to no fiduciary meaning). And that is where the first transformative aspect of the currency is. It's like cash -- when you exchange it with someone, there is no bank involved taking a cut. However, unlike cash, there is actually a simple record of the exchange -- how much and between which wallets. There is a very public and transparent record of every Bitcoin exchange ever done. The currency is inherently more transparent than cash.Why is it so transformative?It's transformative because of its two unique properties: no bank fees and no personally identifiable information being exchanged. And it is these two qualities that the U.S. banking system does not possess. To show you how transformative and powerful those two unique properties are, there are a whole range of possibilities. However, let me explain three business models and one unique group of people who will be profoundly affected by Bitcoin.Publishing and content modelsThe internet was supposed to usher in a whole new era of publishing -- and it did. But what that publishing model became was neither what we deserved nor what we wanted. What

What do antiques and sandwiches have in common? They bring people together.It stood solid. The cast-iron stove a pillar of warmth and comfort. It was the hub, the water cooler if you will, of the late 1800s and early 1900s. It brought people together to share in a source of warmth, meals, and conversation. Today this antique stands as the symbol of Potbelly Sandwich Shop to convey their neighborhood shop attitude: THE POTBELLY STOVE.This symbol can be seen throughout the shop:Originally founded as a small antique shop in Chicago, Illinois, Potbelly Sandwich Shop has made its way to Bethlehem. It is now nestled in the Schoenersville Centre as of November 2015. This franchise was named as one of the nation's 500 fastest growing companies by INC Magazine in 2005, but do not let that deter you. Potbelly aims to shy away from becoming another fast food establishment. How? Through good vibes.LOCAL IMMERSION: First, each franchise owner is responsible to decorate their shop with antiques from the city they reside in.LOCAL LIVE MUSIC: Second, they have live music every Monday and Wednesday. Their current entertainers are: Ken Purcell and Clint Dye. To book a gig at Potbelly you can shoot an email to Ethan, the Franchise Owner, at shop515@potbellyshops.com.SERVICE: Third, they also guarantee no more than an eight minute wait time. Their promise: Fresh, fast, and friendly.This brings me to an interesting tidbit I read in a Thrillist article "11 Things You Didn't Know About Potbelly Sandwich Shop." #3.) They have hidden pig-themed messages in every shop. I even spotted one in the Bethlehem location – a wooden silhouette of a pig with a "P&H" on it. The "P" stands for pigs and the "H" for hogs. This sign stands as a reminder that: pigs get fat and hogs get slaughtered. This slogan acts to teach employees to never to skimp the customer, cheat the customer, or serve the customer something unless is was made that day. Sounds a bit intense, but the sentiment is to be appreciated!If you haven't heard of Potbelly, that's a-okay! Let me introduce you more to what they are known for:Hot PeppersIf you skim the Internet for Potbelly Sandwich Shop you will see oodles of posts noting their Hot Peppers. This condiment is actually an Italian relish of pickled veggies called Giardiniera. Their website totes it as "a unique hot pepper recipe with just the right amount of heat." I agree. It was on the A Wreck sandwich (soon to be described) and they had a nice kick!Straw CookiesPresentation can be everything. That's why I had to get a milkshake when I visited Potbelly! They have mini sugar cookies they thread onto the straw of their hand-dipped milkshakes. I saw them all over Instagram and they are adorable. Talk about dessert after dessert!Both the hot peppers and straw cookies are also retail products at the shop.POTBELLY CHOICEPrepare yourself for this one. Potbelly serves both Pepsi and Coca Cola on one fountain soda dispenser. Wild, huh? Potbelly made the choice not to make the choice between their soda vendor, merging the battle of the brands.Now onto the meaty details of the main dish: SANDWICHES.THE SANDWICHESThe sandwiches I tried were A Wreck and The Mediterranean.A WRECK: Salami, roast beef, turkey, ham, and Swiss cheese (additions: hot peppers, lettuce, tomato, mayo, and spicy mustard)I highly suggest the addition of the hot peppers as it amps this sandwich up a notch.THE MEDITERRANEAN: Zippy hummus, feta cheese, artichoke hearts, crispy cucumbers, and roasted red peppers (additions: chicken and avocado)This sandwich had everything I love shoveled on freshly made bread. The artichoke hearts were my favorite! Their zippy hummus was also delicious. Plus you can never go wrong adding avocado to anything.There is also a Potbelly Secret Menu. This consists of a lot of sandwich combinations. One is the Wrecking Ball which is the A Wreck sandwich above with the addition of meatballs. The whole list can be found on Thrillist.Bethlehem-wise, the current most popular sandwich is The Italian and the most popular milkshake is the Oreo.So if you're looking for a quick
This is the parable of the bottle of wine that promises so much and delivers so little. It begins with my mother who called to say she'd been given a bottle that looked very impressive. What was it, I asked.''Oh, I knew you'd ask that. I don't know. It's a New Zealand sauvignon blanc. That's good isn't it? And it's from Marlborough, which I know is good too. [Heavy sigh] All right, I'll go and look… It's called, I don't know how to pronounce it but… Wairau Cove.''I'd never heard of it but as it turned out I got to try it the very next evening when my friend Olly brought a bottle to a dinner, saying he'd ''bought it for a fiver, reduced from £10 so it ought to be fantastic".Oh dear. This wasn't auspicious. Wine sold at "half price'' is rarely worth any more than you pay for it, and sometimes not even that.The psychology works like this: even though many of us are suspicious of ''half-price deals'', since they're usually created by hiking the initial price so high that it can be dropped again, we still have a hazy idea that hidden away in the £5 we are not forking out there must be some sort of bonus.What bothered me even more was the New Zealand connection. This country isn't known for discounting heavily. Instead it forged a reputation based on quality, persuading us to spend a bit more to buy a mouthful of its clean, green land, as the slogan goes. New Zealand wines commanded a higher average bottle price here than any other country's wine and the premium worked in our favour, too: we paid for good wine, we got good wine, a state of affairs more unusual than you might think.Admittedly, some were better than others, but by and large New Zealand, because it hadn't rushed to supply supermarkets with low-priced, undrinkable tat, was a brand you could trust.The erosion began in 2008 when a huge harvest led to a grape glut. Wine, much of it still good, was sold off cheap. Problem: once you introduce people to cheap, they start expecting it. Result: that's what they get, often at the expense of quality.A year ago we paid an average of £6.43 for a bottle of New Zealand wine. Today, thanks to increased discounting, it has dropped to £6.02 per bottle (still way ahead of France, its closest competitor at £5.01, or the general average of £4.39).Wairau Cove (which I discovered is sold at Tesco) – now back up at £9.99 – is as good an example as any of the sort of NZ sauvignon blanc £5 buys you. The best I can say about this wine is that it had a strong elderflower taste and would have been a brilliant buy to add to a punch made of cordial, soda, wine and lemon juice.As a glass of wine it smelt tired, had lost its fresh zing and had the starchy, watery taste of slices of raw old potatoes. At dinner, I noticed my friends trying small sips then abandoning it for something – indeed, anything – else on the long, crowded table.If you can't rely on the name of New Zealand to guarantee the quality of your wine, you end up having to play detective and here, besides the offer, there were two big clues that all might not be well.The first was the name: Wairau Cove is neither a winery nor a place. It might sound familiar because Wairau Valley is a subregion of Marlborough (incidentally, asked if the grapes actually come from there, Tesco could only say that ''the vast majority of them had") but Wairau Cove doesn't actually exist. The second was the small print on the back label that indicated the wine was bottled in the UK. Together these two clues point in one direction: bulk wine.Bulk wine is wine sold off in liquid mass by co-operatives and wineries who don't want to bottle it themselves. In the case of established wineries this might be because they want to get rid of tanks they don't consider good enough to sell under their own label, or because they have a surplus from a rapidly ageing vintage they need to jettison before the next one comes on-stream, or for some other reason.With Wairau Cove, the bulk wine comes from several sources but there are four key suppliers. Tesco refused to say who but I understand these include Pernod-Ricard (whose Montana – or Brancott Estate, as we must now call it, but that
Kass McQuillen stands in the jungle with Tasha Fox, holding a hatchet in one hand, and Spencer Bledsoe's life in the other. They are debating what to do with his future. Tribal Council looms, and the two Luzon women must make a call: Cut Spencer, the challenge asset they don't trust, or cut J'Tia Taylor, the challenge disaster they do trust. Tasha agonizes over the decision, unsure of which way to turn, so much so that she'll still question the call later that night at Tribal. For Kass? It's whatever. She does not care if the hatchet falls on Spencer. She does not care if the hatchet falls on J'Tia. She just wants to bury the hatchet and move on. "To me, just make a decision, and live with it," the California-based attorney says, describing the situation. "But that's my life. I have to make decisions for people and live with them all the time. Am I the hatchet man for J'Tia or Spencer? I can live with either decision. Either one is the same gamble for me, because I can't predict what's going to happen tomorrow." This is how Kass views Survivor. Cut this person, cut that person, cut all of the persons, as long as you're cutting forward. But she believes people view her as someone who cuts aimlessly. "The public perception is that I'm an idiot," she tells me on the day before Survivor: Cambodia — Second Chance begins. "That's great, because I personally know that I'm not. Every move I made was the only thing I could do to further my game." I don't know how many of the Second Chancers view Kass as an idiot, but I do know that several of them view her as dangerous, unpredictable, and at least a little bit terrifying. Exhibit A: Stephen Fishbach. "She scares me," he tells me a couple of hours after my chat with Kass. "She seems so rational and funny and smart, but uniformly I have heard that she's erratic and vindictive." There are many pop culture touchstones one can use to describe Kass McQuillen, one of the single most iconic villains of the modern Survivor era. Lucy yanking the ball away from Charlie Brown is the one we hear the most. It's a fairly innocuous comparison, but there are more merciless metaphors to explore. In fact, let's dig into it with a game. Who said the following: Kass or The Joker? 1. "Upset the established order, and everything becomes chaos."2. "I want to destroy it."3. "We all know I'm chaotic sometimes."4. "I'm not a monster. I'm just ahead of the curve." Spoiler: Kass owns two of the four. The first and final quotes come from The Dark Knight, the second comes from Survivor: Cagayan, and the third is from our conversation in Cambodia. This is the person who crowned herself Chaos Kass on the same night she burned an entire alliance to the ground, without remorse, without blinking an eye, with a single flip of the vote. This is the person who baffled the winner of her first season so thoroughly that he started speaking llama, the way a Gotham City gangster would lose his mind at the slightest whiff of Joker venom. ("My goal is to make everyone speak an animal language by the end of this season," she tells me.) Anarchy for anarchy's sake is not her sole purpose; you probably won't see Kass burning a pyramid of cash anytime soon, at least not intentionally. But when it comes to the game, she derives visible, undeniable pleasure from her enemies' pain. It's no wonder that so many of her future competitors are freaking out. "Kass named herself Chaos Kass. Do I need to say more?" says Kelley Wentworth when I speak with her. "She's [expletive] nuts, and I'm sure she's coming in here saying we're all [expletive] idiots." Well, to be fair, Kelley, she isn't saying that about all of you. When I first see Kass at Ponderosa, she's heading toward my cabana, walking slow, cutting through the rain with her gaze aimed low. She's the first and last person of the day to deny me when I offer her a spot in front of the fan. She's done with creature comforts. She's all about the heat of the land at this point. How about the rest of her cast mates? "They're cracking already," she grins with glee. "It's great." Kass is not wielding a weapon when we speak, but within the first five words of our conversation, I know that she packed the hatchet. ON THE NEXT PAGE: Chaos in CambodiaThere are few places to hide at Ponderosa. The Survivors sleep in tents, positioned in front of
Andy Dalton is basically Peyton Manning, Jr. Or something. (USATSI)When you think of Peyton Manning -- even the FIESTY 2014 version -- you think of an all-time great signal callers, a legend in the pocket, gigantic, red forehead marks and the word elite. Andy Dalton? Not so much minus the redhead part anyway.But turns out, as NBC noted on Sunday night when Dalton's Bengals played the Cardinals, the two have remarkably similar numbers through three years in the NFL.Dalton and Peyton Manning's numbers in the first 3 years of their careers are remarkably similar #SNF pic.twitter.com/1bqeM8B314 — SNF on NBC (@SNFonNBC) August 25, 2014Now none of this means Dalton will go on to become the next Manning. It's much easier to throw touchdown passes in this day and age and the Bengals certainly offer a better opportunity for success than Manning's Colts.But it also points to the fact that Dalton is an undervalued property in the NFL. He gets ripped for never winning a playoff game and for having great weapons and a great defense. But the guy has put up some good numbers his first three years.
The incident occurred in the midst of a heated national debate over the public prominence of the Confederate battle flag (CBF) after Roof was revealed to have posed for a photo with the banner before embarking on his murderous rampage.The Southern Poverty Law Center documented a spike in rallies and "flaggings" — events where supporters march or ride with the CBF to show their "rebel pride" and "southern heritage" — in the aftermath of the shooting. Groups like the Sons of Confederate Veterans (SCV), Virginia Flaggers and young upstarts like the South Carolina Secessionist Party, all object to perceived attacks on their constructed cultural memory. While the participants at such events are generally older white males, the CBF has found unlikely supporters in a small group of African American neo-Confederates who identify with the banner.The very existence of these black "southern heritage" activists is as infuriating to the neo-Confederate movement's militant right as it is confusing to the mainstream left. The split over who can claim southern identity reveals deep rifts within the movement that have become more pronounced since 2015.The derisive term "Rainbow Confederates" refers to those who acknowledge the contributions of African Americans and other minority groups — willing or not — to the extension of the longest violent uprising against the federal government to date.In 2014, League of the South (LOS) President Michael Hill published a piece on the LOS website, titled "If The South Was Right Then Why Are There Rainbow Confederates?"Notice, however, that I'm not saying a person is a Rainbow Confederate if he merely is interested in the historical accuracy of who fought for whom. After all, history is history. I am saying a person is a Rainbow Confederate if he takes that position in order to placate the Cultural Marxists and to justify the Southern cause in the name of political correctness.For Hill and the League, acknowledging the contributions of black Americans to the Old South's last ditch struggle for survival is tantamount to acknowledging that they have a right to exist in the present day. Within the black Confederate narrative lies a threat to their assertion that the "southern nation" consists solely of "anglo-celtic" Christians.Discussing the sentencing of the individuals who participated in the Douglas County armed confrontation, Matthew Heimbach of the Traditionalist Worker's Party described the flagging incident that spurred it as "not a white nationalist Confederate flag rally" but a "multicultural one, a 'Rainbow Confederate' one".In a video, titled "The Constitution Does Not Apply To White People," Heimbach stated that the event was one where:"…the South wasn't about fighting for the great Anglo-Saxon Southland as George Wallace would say, or as many of our founders and the men who actually fought said, that they were fighting for white interests, and of course the creator of the Confederate Battle flag said that it was a white man's flag. But that doesn't matter to "Rainbow Confederates". Much like conservatives, they care more about an agenda, about freedom and enlightenment era principles, instead of what the history is."African Americans did provide physical and material support to the CSA throughout its existence by performing tasks normally associated with chattel slavery in that period, and in scattered instances toward the close of the war by taking up arms. Most often appeals to this fact by "Rainbows" disregard the core truth that black Confederates were operating in a system of coercion and oppression where the penalty for non-compliance was corporal punishment or death.In touting African American neo-Confederates like H.K. Edgerton, Arlene Barnum, and Anthony Hervey, "heritage" groups are attempting to distance themselves from the more radical wing of the neo-Confederate movement, with its calls for a second secession and return to the slave state.In his "Rainbow Confederates" piece Hill stated:The plain fact of the matter is that the Confederate armies were led and staffed overwhelmingly by white men. And they were fighting for the particular interests of their own Folk.The interest of those folks — as Hill makes clear by citing Robert E. Lee, Jefferson Davis, and Alexander H. Stephens — was the preservation and expansion of the southern slave state.Hatewatch does not list heritage groups like the SCV or Virginia Flaggers as hate groups, though they choose to spend their time and money valorizing the darker parts of our history. Yet in their effort to gloss over the legacy of slavery in the South, these groups strengthen the appeal of Lost Cause mythology, opening the door for violent incidents spurred by the rhetoric of cynical individuals like Michael Hill and Matt Heimbach when the public prominence of those icons is threatened.That this climate emboldened a group demanding blacks "respect the flag" to terrorize a young girl's birthday party
More than just a fancy name. TURNIGY nano-tech Lipoly batteries were designed from the ground up with serious performance in mind. Utilising an advanced LiCo nano-technology substrate that allows electrons to pass more freely from anode to cathode with less internal impedance. In short; less voltage sag and a higher discharge rates than a similar density lithium polymer (non nano-tech) batteries.For those that love graphs, it means higher voltage under load, straighter discharge curves and excellent performance. For pilots it spells stronger throttle punches and unreal straight-up performance. Excellent news for 3D pilots!Unfortunately with other big brands; numbers, ratings and graphs can be fudged. Rest assured, TURNIGY nano-techs are the real deal, delivering unparalleled performance!!Lithium Polymer batteries are used in many RC hobby industries. Over the last few years, Lipo batteries have become the most popular battery choice for anyone looking for a longer run time and higher power.Lipo batteries weigh less and can be made into almost any size or shape. Lipo batteries have higher capacities, hold more power and have a higher discharge rate, meaning they pack more punch. For safe use and storage of Lipo batteries, you need to follow the rules and treat the batteries with the respect they deserve.Specs:Capacity: 5000mAhVoltage: 8S1P / 8S Cell / 29.6VDischarge: 65C Constant / 130C BurstWeight: 1066g (including wire, plug & case)Dimensions: 153x49x71.7mmBalance Plug: JST-XHDischarge Plug: XT-90Advantages over traditional Lipoly batteries;• Power density reaches 7.5 kw/kg.• Less Voltage sag during high rate discharge, giving more power under load.• Internal impedance can reach as low as 1.2mO compared to that of 3mO of a standard Lipoly.• Greater thermal control, pack usually doesn't exceed 60degC• Swelling during heavy load doesn't exceed 5%, compared to 15% of a normal Lipoly.• Higher capacity during heavy discharge. More than 90% at 100% C rate.• Fast charge capable, up to 15C on some batteries.• Longer Cycle Life, almost double that of standard lipoly technology.The nano-core technology in lithium ion batteries is the application of nanometer conductive additives. The nanometer conductive additives form ultra-strong electron-conducting networks in the electrodes which can increase electronic conductivity.These additives create the ability for imbibition in the carrier liquid to supply more ion channels. This improves the ability of ion transmission and ion diffusion. Through improving electronic conductivity and ion transmission, the impedance is reduced and the polarization of high rate discharge decreases greatly.
The man believed to be the filmmaker behind the controversial anti-Muslim film that has sparked rioting in the Middle East is a twice-convicted felon who has served time in federal prison.Nakoula Basseley Nakoula of Cerritos was convicted in 1997 of possession of ephedrine and hydriodic acid, materials commonly used to manufacture methamphetamine, according to court records.Authorities testified that they found $45,000 of cash in a paper bag when they pulled over Nakoula. A deputy testified that Nakoula was transporting pills from a storage facility in Downey to Lake Elsinore.PHOTOS: Attack on U.S consulate in LibyaAnd in 2010, he was convicted of bank fraud after engaging in a scheme to create fake identities and open credit cards in those names, then draw tens of thousands of dollars from the phony accounts. He was sentenced to 21 months in federal prison but was released early in June 2011.Nakoula has denied being the filmmaker, according to the leader of the Coptic Orthodox Diocese of Los Angeles. Bishop Serapion said Nakoula called him Thursday morning and "denied completely any involvement."The bishop said Nakoula called the reports of his connection to the film "a political thing" and also suggested that the media might have been confused.Since an attack on the U.S. Consulate in Libya on Tuesday that killed a U.S. ambassador and three other Americans, Nakoula has been reclusive and has refused to answer the door of the four-bedroom home where he lives.
byTwo of the most important characters in Navaho mythology are twin miracle-performing sons of White-Shell Woman, Yólkai ?stsán, chief goddess. This plate pictures the leader of the two—the first conceived and the first-born, whose father is the sun. His name means "Slayer of Alien Gods," from aná, alien; ye, gods; agán?, to kill. By him, with the assistance of Tobadz?schí?n?, his twin brother, were killed numerous bird, animal, rock, and human monsters, typifying evils, who wantonly destroyed human life.When the Spirit People came upon this earth from below they made six sacred mountains, four on the distant horizon at the cardinal points and two in the centre, Chó?li and Tz?lhnúhod?íhl?. On the eastern slope of Chó?li, brought forth as the daughter of Earth and Sky, was born Yólkai Estsán, White-Shell Woman. First Man took her to his home near Tz?lhnúhod?hl?, where she matured in twelve days into a beautiful woman with supernatural powers. Later she lived in a home of her own at the foot of this mountain. It was while there that she gave birth to twin boys who became saviours of their people, slaying alien gods who were fast depopulating the earth.Yólkai Estsán would often lie on the eastern slope of the mountain as the sun rose through the morning, and when the day grew warm would seek the shade of jutting rocks from which trickled shining drops of water. Quite unknown to herself she had conceived one day from the sunbeams and the dripping water. When she became aware that she was to become a mother Yólkai ?stsán was made very happy, for she did not enjoy living alone. Soon she found herself the proud possessor of twin boys. The first-born and the stronger came to be known in his youth as Nayé?n?zgan?, Slayer of Alien Gods; the other was always known as Tobadz?schí?n?, Born From Water. Their prenatal life covered a period of only twelve days, and maturity was attained in thirty-two days after passing through eight changes, one of which came every four days.At that time the earth was infested with great giants, foreign gods, who were rapidly destroying the people. Of these, Yé?tso, Big God, as large as a mountain, was the only one in human[pg 099] form. The others were Man-eating Bird, Rolling Stone, that crushed all in its path, Tracking Bear, and Antelope, who killed without mercy. Fearing lest some of these monsters learn of the presence of her boys, Yólkai ?stsán kept them hidden away on the mountain side, but they chafed under confinement, so she made them bows and arrows and let them play about, but admonished them not to stray far from home. The boys promised to obey, but not long afterward, because in reply to their questions their mother told them she did not know who their father was, they became sulky and broke their promise, going off toward the east. They would go and search for someone who knew. When on a small knoll a long way from home they heard a whispered "Sh-h.""Are you afraid, my younger brother?" asked Nayé?n?zgan?."No!" was the quick response.Four times they heard the whisper, and then two of the Wind People appeared. "We saw you travelling eastward," said they, "and came to caution you. The land is cursed with alien gods who kill for pleasure; beware of them! Why do you journey thus alone without your father?""Our father! Alas, we know nothing of him and are now starting on a search to learn. Do you know who he is?" asked the boys."Yes, the Sun is your father; but if you think to find him you will have to travel far eastward and cross the wide, wide waters."Nayé?n?zgan? turned to his younger brother and said, "Síts?l?, let us go."The Sun was then overhead. Being in fact of a holy nature, the boys covered distance rapidly and by mid-afternoon had passed well beyond the limits of their homeland. There they[pg 100] came upon an old woman sitting beside a ladder projecting from a hole. She asked them who they were and whither they were going. They told her to the Sun, whose sons they were, but whom they had never seen.
This week, the management group overseeing Germany's Nürburgring Nordschleife moved to ban manufacturers from attempting and publishing timed laps on the famed, 13-mile course. For car enthusiasts who judge modern sports cars by how quickly they can round the circuit, it's an unthinkable, if not wholly unexpected, turn of events.For Christian Von Koenigsegg, it's even more disappointing; the news comes just days before he was to spend a week at the circuit with the new Koenigsegg One:1 hypercar in hopes of setting a lap record. It's part of Koenigsegg's three-year plan to establish the One:1 as the fastest production car in the world.It was early Tuesday morning when I received an urgent phone call from Christian. In two days, I was to jump on a plane with my team to capture the Koenigsegg lap-time effort for our upcoming 4K documentary, APEX, which we're producing in conjunction with Sony. This is the final chapter in a storyline that follows the past three years of auto manufacturers battling it out for technological dominance in producing halo cars for the next decade, cars including the Porsche 918, McLaren P1, and Ferrari LaFerrari. All have shown what they're worth on the track, but the Koenigsegg One:1 has yet to do so.Now we have a new story to tell: The Nürburgring benchmark of sports-car superiority has come to a screeching halt, and the Koenigsegg One:1's place on the leaderboard is in jeopardy. We'd been on stand-by to fly across the Atlantic (on moments' notice) to capture Koenigsegg's attempt. This time, helicopter crews were ready to go, logistics were sorted, and travel was booked. The sudden notification from Nürburgring management couldn't have come at a more inopportune moment for everyone.The decision to ban timed laps stems from an accident earlier this year at a VLN race, involving driver Jann Mardenborough, in which a spectator was killed. Track management reacted by imposing a speed limit at Flugplatz, where the crash occurred. Since then, management has imposed further restrictions in other high-speed sectors. This is a particularly disappointing development for Koenigsegg, since the One:1's flat-out speed in those sectors would likely have given it a lap-time advantage. In Tiergarten, for instance, a long, fast section where Christian estimates the One:1 could easily hit 300 kph, speed is now restricted to just 200 kph.Official word from Nurburgring management is that these restrictions will be reviewed at the end of the year, but for the time being, manufacturers like Koenigsegg are banned from attempting lap-time runs — even if they've rented out the entire track for themselves. The Koenigsegg team and the One:1 are now stuck in a holding pattern. They have a car that's ready to attack the northern loop. Their simulations and data suggest they've got a good chance to best their competitors. Even Koenigsegg's past track data suggests their best segment times, when stitched together, would undercut the Porsche 918's official 6:57 time by double-digit seconds.But there's a twist to the story. After the initial restrictions were in place, Lamborghini ran its new Aventador SV and published a sub-seven-minute lap time. Nürburgring management claims Lamborghini's attempt happened one day before they issued the latest round of restrictions. Yet at the same time, WTCC laps have been allowed to ignore all speed limits all together? What's the deal? We're investigating.So what's next for Koenigsegg and our film, APEX? The helicopter crews are ready, the One:1 is ready, but we don't have anywhere to run the car.Is there a new benchmark to be set? Should nearby Spa Francorchamps, another long, high-speed track with motorsports provenance, become the new venue for lap time tests? Maybe a stateside circuit like the four-mile West Grand course at VIR would fit the bill? What about setting an endurance record? Let the Reddit car forums march with their keyboards and pitchforks.Author: J.F.

About Locale Emulator and the concept of locale emulation itselfI came across this program a while ago myself, and was just as amazed by its premise. I looked at the source code, and saw lots of involved low-level NT kernel voodoo I don't understand, instead of the code I tend to use to solve this kind of problem. Truly, this must be an amazing piece of software, I thought... until I tested it with th135 and noticed that it rendered the Music Room text as exactly the same garbage you see when running the game without any locale emulation. Yeah, it did display 東方心綺楼 in the title bar and correctly referenced the 御首頂戴帳 folder, but overall I'd consider this to be a worse alternative to AppLocale.So I did some research, and it turns out that this thing merely implements the bare minimum of functionality necessary (namely, changing the system ANSI code page in memory) to purportedly keep games from crashing. Anything just a bit more involved (and the text rendering in recent Tasofro games certainly is) appears to be outside of its scope. I wouldn't trust it. (But hey, at least it produces nice crash dumps.)Oh, and of course th14 would still crash if it is in a path containing characters outside its emulated locale. It saddens me that we have to continue to play this locale game, with any inferior AppLocale knock-off being heralded as The Perfect Solution. On the other hand, thcrap is the proof that you can most solve issues with this locale crud and then some by writing wrapper functions that expect and return UTF-8 instead, and defining a fallback code page (not "locale") for compatibility. Yes, it's a mostly stupid and mindless affair (there are some functions you need to wrap more creatively, but they are few and far between), but given thcrap's premise of being a multilingual patcher, I see no other way. And since it's a rather high-level implementation, it also works on every Windows version since 98, as well as in Wine.So, for those who are on XP, Vista or Linux and need a solution other than AppLocale, this is how you would use thcrap's UTF-8 wrapper part for any application:Download thcrap and extract it.Open Notepad, paste {} , and save this as null.js .Right-click thcrap_loader.exe and create a new shortcut.Right-click the new shortcut and click Properties.Add null.js , followed by a space, followed by the full path to your game's executable, to the end of the the Target field. For example, if you wanted to play Hopeless Masquerade, you'd have something like "C:\Full\path\to\thcrap_loader.exe" null.js "C:\Full\path\to\Touhou 13.5 - Hopeless Masquerade\th135.exe" in the Target field.Rename the shortcut, and put it anywhere you like.Run the game by clicking the shortcut.There will be bugs. I'd like to keep this thing small and simple, and hence, I'll only add functionality once I notice that something needs it; I also wouldn't have a test case otherwise. As a result, it might even break things that would work if you ran the game without any locale emulation at all. Please tell me; I'd like to get these fixed, too.About Unicode and locales on WindowsFirstly, there is no such thing as a "Unicode locale" (or, to use correct terminology, a system ANSI code page for the UTF-8 encoding). Yes, if Windows had one, we wouldn't have these problems to begin with. However, Microsoft shows no signs of ever moving into this direction. They even have valid reasons; this would break with the entire history on Unicode in Windows, but more on that later.Instead, every Windows system is set to a specific system code page, which can be one of these. And yes, even though UTF-8 appears in this list, it is impossible to use it as an ANSI code page (which is exactly what we would need).I agree that changing your system locale is an overly drastic measure that should be disapproved of. If you look at the definition of the term "locale", the code page is only one aspect among many others. It saddens me that this term is used almost synonymously to "code page" in the otaku scene, only because locales on Windows are fixed entities (you cannot, for example, run your system in an American English locale using the Shift-JIS encoding, although that would make perfect sense

While proponents of mandating a higher minimum wage claim it would help Michigan residents get off food stamps, the evidence from past increases shows this not to be true.In 2007, the minimum wage in Michigan increased from $5.15 an hour to $6.95 an hour. That year, the number of people on food stamps increased from 1.1 million to 1.2 million. In 2008, the minimum wage increased again from $6.95 an hour to $7.15. Again, the number of food stamp recipients went up from 1.2 million to 1.26 million.Yet, the left-leaning Center for American Progress recently released a report that claimed raising the minimum wage to $10.10 would get at least 110,000 families in Michigan off food stamps. President Obama and political allies are pushing for the higher mandated wage. The Center for American Progress has strong ties to the Clinton and Obama administrations. The group's president, Neera Tanden, worked as director of domestic policy for the Obama-Biden presidential campaign and also has worked as policy director for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign."The economy is complex and there are many factors working among each other," said James Hohman, assistant director of fiscal policy at the Mackinac Center for Public Policy. "Michigan's experience shows that the direction of the economy is the most important factor in whether food stamp rolls increase or decrease."The Employment Policies Institute cited a half dozen studies and analyses from 2003 to 2009 that highlights why a correlation between minimum wage and food stamps is on shaky ground.EPI pointed out that in 2009, the average family income of those earning minimum wage was more than $48,000. The 2009 U.S. Census stated that 16.5 percent of those earning minimum wage were raising a family on minimum wage. The remaining 83.5 percent were teenagers living with working parents, adults living alone or married couples with dual incomes.And EPI cited a Ball State University study that found when the federal minimum wage increased by 40 percent from July 2007 to July 2009 there were 550,000 fewer part-time jobs as a result of the increase.According to EPI, when employers are faced with higher labor costs, they hire workers with more work experience and higher skill levels. Workers with lower skills and less work experience are pushed out of the market for jobs.Mandating a higher minimum wage also is associated with job losses. A Congressional Budget Office report released in February said increasing the wage mandate to $10.10 per hour would lead to the loss of about 500,000 jobs. The report also said some employees would be paid more, but that would come at the expense of others being laid off. The laid off workers would be more likely to use food stamps and other government programs.The results of the Center for American Progress study contradict what studies have shown about minimum wage, said Antony Davies, an associate professor of economics at Duquesne University."Increases in the minimum wage may or may not result in an increase in overall unemployment," Davies said. "However, increases in the minimum wage do result in a shifting in employment away from lesser skilled, lesser educated workers toward higher skilled, higher educated workers. Minimum wage increases provide increases in incomes for workers who keep their jobs, but cause decreases in incomes for workers who are laid off."Davies said in times of prosperity, food stamp use declines because more people are working. Also, when the economy is thriving, there tends to be an increase in minimum wage."There is no causal relationship between minimum wage and food stamps, rather rising incomes are driving both of the measures," Davies said.Small business owners in Michigan say a mandated wage increase would lead to layoffs and higher prices.~~~~~See also:Who Is Behind the Minimum Wage Increase Drive?Bars, Restaurants Could See 280 Percent Increase In Costs With Minimum Wage Ballot ProposalSchauer, Other Michigan Dems Call For Higher Minimum Wage While Paying Their Interns NothingDebate Du Jour: Minimum Wage Takes Center StageMinimum Wage For Thee But Not For Me?Harming the Competition: Why some companies want a higher minimum wageMinimum Wage Increase: A Serious Effort or Just Rhetoric?Minimum Wage, Maximum HarmBig Business Supports Minimum Wage Hikes

"The Art Behind the Tape" is a Coffee Table Book exploring the History of Mixtape Cover Art.For those that know me and specifically those who are in my email database,it is a known fact that i have been toying around with this "History of Mix tapes" project for quite some time. After purchasing a book on rappers and there jewelry collection(BLING BLING),i started to think about what other hip hop related stories there are that haven't been told. Very naturally it dawned on me that no one has told the story about the history of mix tapes,especially the cover art. I found that interesting, especially since it's such a global phenomenon. For months i wrestled with the idea, i even thought i would give it to another writer,and let them tell the story(bad idea,glad i didn't do it). So i took to the drawing board and started to put pen to the pad and jot down a list of dj's who shaped the game. Finally my idea started to take some shape and form. The initial idea shifted a little though. At first i was going to write a coffee table book based on the entire history of the mix tape movement. Then i decided,nah maybe i will film a documentary on the history of mixtapes (in the works as i type). So now that the idea has some form and shape to it,i again put pen to the pad and started to shake it up a bit. Since i plan on directing a documentary on the entire history of mixtapes, I figured the book should be a little different. Me and my creative team decided to focus on the cover art instead of the dj's. This new direction allows for the documentary and book to focus on mix tapes but from two different angles.I remember as a kid i would stare at album covers and marvel at some the art work. For instance A Tribe Called Quests "Low End Theory", De La Soul's "3 Feet High and Rising",to Big Daddy Kane's "Long Live the Kane". All three covers gave you a mental picture of the music before you heard one song. Surprisingly mix tape covers have taken on the same role. For example, Dj Drama's early Gangsta Grillz series artwork looked better than some of those artists album covers. When Dj Clue wanted to separate himself from the pack,it was the imagery done by the crew from P Type Graphics. History was starting to repeat itself in a very important way.With all of these thoughts bouncing in my head,i thought what better way to represent them than to write a book displaying this very dope piece of mix tape history. From that thought forward i decided to put together a coffee table book displaying a visual history of mixtape art. From the days when the Kid Capri's of the world just wrote dates on their tape "Kid Capri 2-18". To the current era where a mix tape dj would commission a skilled graphic designer to craft a piece of marketable art that would allow the tape to compete with an album.So there you have it,my idea in all its glory. I felt the best way to do it is for me to do it. Going the traditional route and seeking a publishing house would be cool,but what if they wanted to change the direction? What if they only wanted to cover the dj's they felt were MTV material,no thats not the real story. I want to tell the story from an insiders perspective,from the perspective of a kid who bought and coveted mix tapes. I want the visual history to include the Dj Green Lantern's as well as the Dj iroc's,and everyone in between.At its core hip hop is all about independence and self expression. I feel it is my duty as a card carrying member of the hip hop community to tell this story the right way!-DJ MARS
Playboy magazine is putting the clothes back on.Executives for the magazine's parent company revealed that the publication will no longer publish fully nude photos of women as part of an upcoming redesign in a piece published Monday by the New York Times.The change will take effect in March 2016.According to the Times, Playboy editor Cory Jones approached magazine founder Hugh Hefner last month with the idea to drop nude photos from the print edition. Hefner, who is still listed on the masthead as editor in chief, gave the idea his blessing.Also Read: Playboy Slaps MediaTakeOut With Lawsuit Over Azealia Banks Nude Photos"You're now one click away from every sex act imaginable for free," Playboy CEO Scott Flanders told the paper. "And so it's just passé at this juncture."Playboy's print circulation, once measured in millions, is now about 800,000, according to Alliance for Audited Media.The magazine will still include photo spreads of women in provocative poses. But the move marks the latest step away from depictions of nudity, which were banned from the magazine's website last August.

"Signs point to Dexter Fowler staying in Colorado," writes ESPN's Jerry Crasnick, citing both the Rockies' large asking price for the outfielder and potential trade partners' concerns about Fowler's ability to hit outside of Coors Field (Twitter links). Fowler has a career .882 OPS at home and just a .698 OPS on the road over his five-year career, and he put up an even larger set of splits (.984 OPS home/.720 OPS road) in 2012 when he posted a career-best .300/.389/.474 slash line for the Rockies.A rival executive tells Crasnick that the Rockies are asking for a "sky high" return for Fowler, who is projected to get a raise to $4MM in his second year of arbitration eligibility by MLBTR's Matt Swartz. The Braves were interested in Fowler but balked at giving up two top prospects, according to CBS Sports' Danny Knobler. Fowler would have been Atlanta's leadoff hitter, as the Braves are still looking for a table-setter since they intend to use the newly-signed B.J. Upton in the middle of the lineup.The Rockies want a similarly large trade package in exchange for Michael Cuddyer, Knobler reports. Cuddyer is seven years older than Fowler but comes with cost-certainty (two years and $21MM remaining on his contract) and is more proven as a hitter outside of Colorado.
Preferring composition isn't just about polymorphism. Although that is part of it, and you are right that (at least in nominally typed languages) what people really mean is "prefer a combination of composition and interface implementation." But, the reasons to prefer composition (in many circumstances) are profound.Polymorphism is about one thing behaving multiple ways. So, generics/templates are a "polymorphic" feature in so far as they allow a single piece of code to vary its behavior with types. In-fact, this type of polymorphism is really the best behaved and is generally referred to as parametric polymorphism because the variation is defined by a parameter.Many languages provide a form of polymorphism called "overloading" or ad hoc polymorphism where multiple procedures with the same name are defined in an ad hoc manner, and where one is chosen by the language (perhaps the most specific). This is the least well behaved kind of polymorphism, since nothing connects the behavior of the two procedures except developed convention.A third kind of polymorphism is subtype polymorphism. Here a procedure defined on a given type, can also work on a whole family of "subtypes" of that type. When you implement an interface or extend a class you are generally declaring your intention to create a subtype. True subtypes are governed by Liskov's Substitution Principle, which says that if you can prove something about all objects in a supertype you can prove it about all instances in a subtype. Life gets dangerous though, since in languages like C++ and Java, people generally have unenforced, and often undocumented assumptions about classes which may or may not be true about their subclasses. That is, code is written as if more is provable than it really is, which produces a whole host of issues when you subtype carelessly.Inheritance is actually independent of polymorphism. Given some thing "T" which has a reference to itself, inheritance happens when you create a new thing "S" from "T" replacing "T"s reference to itself with a reference to "S". That definition is intentionally vague, since inheritance can happen in many situations, but the most common is subclassing an object which has the effect of replacing the this pointer called by virtual functions with the this pointer to the subtype.Inheritance is a dangerous like all very powerful things inheritance has the power to cause havoc. For example, suppose you override a method when inheriting from some class: all is well and good until some other method of that class assumes the method you inherit to behave a certain way, after all that is how the author of the original class designed it. You can partially protect against this by declaring all methods called by another of your methods private or non-virtual (final), unless they are designed to be overridden. Even this though isn't always good enough. Sometimes you might see something like this (in pseudo Java, hopefully readable to C++ and C# users)interface UsefulThingsInterface { void doThings(); void doMoreThings(); } ... class WayOfDoingUsefulThings implements UsefulThingsInterface{ private foo stuff; public final int getStuff(); void doThings(){ //modifies stuff, such that ... ... } ... void doMoreThings(){ //ignores stuff ... } }you think this is lovely, and have your own way of doing "things", but you use inheritance to acquire the ability to do "moreThings",class MyUsefulThings extends WayOfDoingUsefulThings{ void doThings { //my way } }And all is well and good. WayOfDoingUsefulThings was designed in such a way that replacing one method doesn't change the semantics of any other... except wait, no it wasn't. It just looks like it was, but doThings changed mutable state that mattered. So, even though it didn't call any override-able functions,void dealWithStuff(WayOfDoingUsefulThings bar){ bar.doThings() use(bar.getStuff()); }now does something different than expected when you pass it a MyUsefulThings . Whats worse, you might not even know that WayOfDoingUsefulThings made those promises. Maybe dealWithStuff comes from the same library as WayOfDoingUsefulThings and getStuff() isn't even exported by the library (think of friend classes in C++). Worse still, you have defeated the static checks of the language without realizing it: dealWithStuff took a WayOfDoingUsefulThings just to make sure that it would have a getStuff() function that behaved a certain way.Using compositionclass MyUsefulThings implements UsefulThingsInterface{ private way = new WayOfDoingUsefulThings() void doThings() { //my way } void doMoreThings() { this
A few months ago it came up that someone was able to get audio to play in my preferred programming language, R. Even better, the piece they orchestrated was the highly litigated "Birthday Song" that was even more recently freed from copyright purgatory. I quickly realized that this was an excellent opportunity to finally get the precision I wanted from the experimental Bach Canon that I had previously composed. So that's what I did!Old SchoolYou can listen to my original version to while reading my original verbose explanation below:The Endlessly Rising Canon (Canon a 2, per tonos; Bach's Musical Offering) was made known to me by Douglas Hofstadter's Pulitzer-winning book Godol, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid. The canon consists of an eight measure phrase beginning in C minor. "What makes this canon different from any other is that when it concludes-or, rather, seems to conclude-it is no longer in the key of C minor, but now is in D minor… And it is so constructed that this 'ending' ties smoothly onto the beginning again… After six repetitions of the canon it returns to the key of C minor, but now one octave higher." […] Anyone who has played with a record player knows that as the speed of an audio track increases, so does it's pitch. A sound played twice as fast has the same pitch as before, but one octave higher. I exploit this audio-timescale/pitch-modification connection to play the canon in 16 different octaves. I record one iteration of the canon and speed it up digitally by a factor of 2^1/6 or 1.1225 (or 12.25% faster) to get the next iteration of the canon… just as recording a C4 tone and increasing its tempo by a factor of 1.1225 will result in a D4 tone. Repeating this process six times results in the tempo doubling; i.e. a power rule of exponents. With six iterations recorded I am able to paste them together as one audio file and digitally double the tempo to get the next six iterations that are one octave higher. This process was repeated 16 times resulting in the canon being played in 16 different octaves (C4 to C19), with the tempo doubling 16 times (60 bpm to 3932160 bpm ( or 2^16 = 65536 beats per second (bps) ) ). To make the speed/tempo increase smooth throughout the canon, each measure is 2^(1/6*1/8) or 1.01455 times (1.455 %) faster than the previous measure.New SchoolI'm going to walk through the code that I used to create this piece in R. The major contributions here are that I had to figure out how to:create polyphony from two sine waves speed up the a wave's tone while increasing its pitch create mathematically precise accelerandoWarning: You'll need to be able to at least copy/paste code into R to listen to this piece. Also, the audio package doesn't have native Linux support. If someone gets it working key me know.I worked off of the original StackExchange piece, but it had a very new school style of R coding utilizing the magrittr and dplyr packages. My brain works much more clearly in vanilla R so I converted many of the pieces back to something more familiar to me. For that reason, the code is a bit of a hodge-podge of naming conventions. Also, I code at work all day, so I'm letting my hair down on this one.First, I loaded the audio library and then I hard-coded the notes and their corresponding numbers that were later used to create the actual sine waves.library("audio") notes <- c(G2 = -14, Ab2 = -13, A2 = -12, Bb2 = -11, B2 = -10, C3 = -9, Db3 = -8, D3 = -7, Eb3 = -6, E3 = -5, F3 = -4, Fs3 = -3, Gb3 = -3, G3 = -2, Ab3 = -1, A3 = 0, Bb3 = 1, B3 = 2, C = 3, Db = 4, D = 5, Eb = 6, E = 7, F = 8, Fs = 9, Gb = 9, G = 10, Ab = 11) notes.num <- notes + 48Next I used the almost the exact same make_sine function, except that I removed the last sample from the wave vector. I did this so I would get the desired number of samples and not the desired number plus 1.make_sine <- function(fre
Ulster's Democratic Unionist Party, which is expected to prop up Theresa May's minority government over the coming months, has spurned Tory Remainers who hoped they would force the Prime Minister to ask the EU for a so-called 'Soft Brexit'.According to ITV's Robert Peston, a source within the DUP "was very keen to be quoted" as saying that his party "completely backs [May's] vision of Brexit" – and not that of her Chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond.While both May and Hammond campaigned for a Remain vote during the EU referendum, the Prime Minister has subsequently endorsed what supporters call a "Clean Brexit", taking Britain out of the bloc's Single Market and its associated Free Movement regime, as well as the Customs Union which precludes member-states from conducting an independent trade policy.Remain diehards, who want a 'Soft Brexit' in which Britain would remain party to the Single Market and Customs Union in order to maintain the closest possible links to the European Union, term this a "Hard" or "Extreme" Brexit.Hammond's team at HM Treasury – the engine room of the Remain campaign's 'Project Fear' under his predecessor George Osborne – are said to have entered "street-fighting mode" as he canvasses support for such a deal.DUP backs Theresa May's vision of Brexit, not Philip Hammond's – ITV News https://t.co/am8htKLfJD — Robert Peston (@Peston) June 15, 2017If Peston's source is reliable, however, it seems the 'Soft Brexit' faction have lost crucial leverage. It had been claimed that the DUP, which is keen to see a minimum of economic friction between Ulster and the Irish Republic after Brexit, would at least back their calls for Britain to stay in the Customs Union.The ITV presenter has been led to believe that the DUP is "100 per cent committed to the UK leaving the Single Market AND the Customs Union" – having preferred to use its bargaining power to press for plans to introduce means-testing for the winter fuel allowance and scrap the pensions triple lock to be dropped.Leavers within the Government are predicting ferocious resistance to Brexit from without the Cabinet as well as within, with one minister predicting "utterly bitter, trench warfare" as opposition politicians and Tory rebels "fight us line by line, in committees, on the floor and in the Lords, for months and months on end."

byThere are so many areas of conventional democratic governance being challenged or eliminated by the Stephen Harper wrecking crew it is hard to keep up. Those searching for a line in the sand that even this government won't cross still haven't found it. So far, it seems, there is nothing (save the military and prisons) that is sacrosanct.Minimally, all governments take seriously the protection of their citizens; otherwise there is scarcely any point in having one. Yet recent reports reveal that that the Harper government has virtually eliminated monitoring of the ozone layer over Canada. The government has shut down four of five very sophisticated monitoring stations leaving only a single station – at UBC in Vancouver – still gathering information about this critical aspect of our environment.In doing so, Canada is once again demonstrating that it is becoming a rogue state. It has already established this reputation by walking away from its Kyoto commitments. The monitoring of the ozone layer – which protects the earth from harmful radiation – is an international task requiring the co-operation of many countries. Canada, because of it enormous territory and its large share of the Arctic where the ozone layer is most threatened – is absolutely key to global monitoring. Last week, according to CBC TV's Environmental Unit , "…five scientists from high-profile U.S. universities and NASA released a scathing critique of Canada's cuts to its ozone monitoring, saying it is jeopardizing the world's ability to watch for holes in the ozone layer and pollutants high in the atmosphere."But beyond the contempt shown for the international community, the deliberate sabotage of ozone monitoring again demonstrates two of the most prominent features of the Harper government: its disdain and even hostility towards science (and its own scientists) and its determination to promote the oil industry and protect it from any possible criticism.It is not just ozone monitoring that has been gutted. In a response to the revelation Environment Canada acknowledged that other pollutants-monitoring was also being downgraded: "The number of staff in measurement activities for the monitoring of ozone, tropospheric pollution and atmospheric transport of toxic chemicals has remained constant but their work now includes other departmental priorities."Tropospheric pollution is essentially pollution particles caused by combustion – industrial, automobile, forest fires, etc. – the kind of pollution that is the most dangerous to human health.The same day that the revelations about the Conservatives' cuts to pollution monitoring were published, an article in the New York Times reported on several new studies that revealed living in polluted air is even more hazardous to your health than previously thought. One study found that air breathed by most Americans (it's hardly any different in Canadian cities) "…greatly accelerates declines in measures of memory and attention span." A study in Boston concluded that the odds of having a stroke increased by 30 per cent even on days when pollution was classified as moderate – a category that is supposed to suggest minimal danger to health. It went up to 60% for bad pollution days and the effects were almost immediate – within 12-14 hours.A study published in the American Journal of Medicine revealed that common pollutants – carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide – "…raised a person's immediate risk of suffering a heart attack..", increasing heart rates and thickening the blood, accelerating the development of atherosclerosis.Why would any government deliberately take steps that they know will make it more difficult to protect the health of its citizens? A health Canada report published in 2005 concluded that 6,000 people a year in Canada died as a direct result of air pollution and that the health costs of that pollution were a billion dollars a year.But the Harper government's priority is not the health of Canadians or the quality of the air we breathe and the water we drink. Its single-minded purpose is to promote the oil industry and protect it from any criticism. Demonizing critics of the tar sands as enemies of the country is just one small part of that goal. Eliminating scientific data that could link the oil industry to negative health effects is another. Why else would the government stop monitoring for pollution?If the message is giving you trouble, shoot the messengers. That's exactly what Harper has done and will continue to do in his March budget. Last fall Environment Canada announced that some 700 scientists and researchers would be losing their jobs. Sixty were fired in January.MURRAY DOBBIN, now living in Powell River, BC has been a journalist, broadcaster, author and social activist for over forty years.

One of the longest-running horror film series began with this gory shocker from director Sean S. Cunningham, who had previously produced Wes Craven's classic Last House on the Left. Entrepreneur Steve Christie (Peter Brouwer) re-opens Camp Crystal Lake after many years during which it has been cursed by murders and bad luck. The young and nubile counselors all begin to die extremely bloody deaths at the hands of an unseen killer during a rainstorm which isolates the camp. A woman is chopped in the face with an axe, another has her throat sliced in amazingly gruesome fashion, a male counselor (Harry Crosby) is pinned to a door with arrows, and a young Kevin Bacon has an arrow shoved through his throat from below a bed. Victor Miller's script is not particularly impressive, but Cunningham's tense direction, and some remarkable special-effects by acclaimed makeup artist Tom Savini are enough to make it worthwhile. 1950s quiz show regular Betsy Palmer appears as the cook whose son, Jason (Ari Lehman), drowned 25 years earlier while neglected by romancing counselors. Palmer was reportedly cast because she was willing to drive her own car to and from the set. Trivia buffs should note the decapitation scene near the end, in which the female killer exhibits rather hirsute hands clutching at the air. The hands belong to Savini's assistant, Taso N. Stavrakis. Friday the 13th made nearly 40 million dollars at the box office and spawned numerous sequels. ~ Robert Firsching, Rovi
John Milius's jingoistic direction and pulpy screenplay fit perfectly into this film version of the Robert E. Howard fantasy story of the sword and sorcery hero, Conan the Barbarian. Complementing Mulius's heavy metal production is Arnold Schwarzenegger's leaden acting, which in any other context would be deadly, but here (as in The Terminator) corresponds nicely with the whole sonorous project. The story begins when a horde of rampaging warriors massacre the parents of young Conan and enslave the young child for years on The Wheel of Pain. The Wheel of Pain seems to have as its only purpose the building up of Conan's muscles, so it's no surprise that one day Conan grows up to become Arnold Schwarzenegger. As the sole survivor of the childhood massacre, Conan is released from slavery and taught the ancient arts of fighting. Transforming himself into a killing machine, Conan travels into the wilderness to seek vengeance on Thulsa Doom (James Earl Jones), the man responsible for killing his family. In the wilderness, Conan takes up with the thieves Valeria (Sandahl Bergman) and Subota (Gerry Lopez). The trio comes upon a weird snake cult, linked to Doom, and Conan wants to trek off to Doom's mountain retreat to kill him. But he is prevented from doing that by King Osrik (Max Von Sydow), who wants the trio of warriors to help rescue his daughter who has joined Doom in the hills. ~ Paul Brenner, Rovi
Five people, including a 10-year-old boy, are dead after an SUV driver going east apparently lost control of his car and crossed a Long Island Expressway median in Manorville—and then went airborne hitting two other vehicles. Many first responders called it one of the "worst" crashes they'd ever seen.The crash occurred around 9:35 a.m. near Exit 68 on the LIE, and the Suffolk County police said that Carmelo Pinales, 26, was driving east in the Subaru Outback that barreled into the westbound lanes, hitting a Honda and a BMW. Suffolk County Chief of Detectives Gerard Gigante said, "It looks like the Outback went airborne, hit the top of the Honda — the Honda doesn't have front-end damage, but has significant roof damage. And it appears the BMW and the Outback collided. The engine of the Outback was thrown several hundred feet into the woods. The car is pretty much destroyed. It's broken up into numerous pieces."NEW YORK: UPDATE: 5 people were killed in today's horrific LIE crash; including 10y/o and a former aide to Gov Cuomo pic.twitter.com/hyvMN46Tq3 — KolHaolam (@KolHaolam) August 22, 2016Pinales and his sister Patricia Pinales, 27, were pronounced dead at the scene while his son Christopher Pinales, 10, died at Stony Brook University Hospital. Other occupants of the car, Winnifer Garcia, 21, and Patricia Pinales' three-year-old daughter, were hospitalized for non-life-threatening injuries.The Honda's driver, Scott Martella, 29, was killed in the crash, while his fiancee, Shelbi Thurau, 29, was hospitalized for non-life-threatening injuries. Martella, a former aide to Governor Cuomo, was communications director for Suffolk County Executive Steve Bellone.An occupant of the BMW, Isidore Adelson, 81, died from his injuries last night; the BMW's driver, Marvin Tenzer, 73, and passengers, Sandra Tenzer, 69, and Helen Adelson, were hospitalized for non-life-threatening injuries.Christopher Pinales had turned 10 and the family was reportedly heading to a birthday celebration when the crash occurred.Family: Carmelo Pinales, sister Patricia, 10 year-old son killed in LIE crash were heading to celebrate son's BDay. pic.twitter.com/zWfdypMM7I — CeFaan Kim (@CeFaanKim) August 22, 2016Investigators are looking into whether Pinales was speeding. However, according to WABC 7, "Relatives of the Pinales' family say they believe an earlier accident left an oil spill, which contributed to the crash."Governor Cuomo issued a statement, "I extend my deepest condolences to the family and friends of those lost in the accident that occurred on Sunday morning on the Long Island Expressway... I personally knew Scott Martella who was among those killed in the crash as he served in my administration for more than four years. Scott was a dedicated, beloved public servant who worked day in and day out to improve the lives of his fellow New Yorkers. Scott was always full of big ideas to help solve the toughest challenges of the day, and he was deeply respected for his strong work ethic, candor and fighting spirit. Long Island is a better place today because of his service and dedication to the community."
UFC 168: Weidman vs. Silva II Already One of the Biggest Gates in UFC HistoryUFC 168 takes place on Dec. 28 at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas and features the highly anticipated rematch between middleweight champion Chris Weidman and former titleholder Anderson Silva.UFC president Dana White revealed during the UFC Fight Night 32 post-fight press conference on Saturday night that UFC 168 has already garnered a $5.6 million gate, ranking it as one of the biggest events in the promotion's 20-year history."Anderson is gonna fight Chris Weidman on Dec. 28 in Las Vegas and it is gonna be the biggest fight we've ever done," said White. "That gate is already at like $5.6 million and the pay-per-view is gonna be huge. It's gonna be a massive event and whoever wins, yes, will fight Vitor Belfort, unless something crazy happens and somebody gets hurt."The largest gate in UFC history was UFC 129, which took place at the Rogers Centre in Toronto on April 30, 2011. The event featured welterweight champion Georges St-Pierre facing Jake Shields and brought in a staggering $12,075,000 gate.The biggest gate in the U.S. is UFC 148, which featured Anderson Silva putting his middleweight title on the line against Chael Sonnen for the second time. That event was also held at the MGM Grand Garden Arena and did $6,901,655 in gate receipts.UFC 168 also features the battle of The Ultimate Fighter 18 coaches, bantamweight champion Ronda Rousey and former Strikeforce titleholder Miesha Tate.Like MMAWeekly.com on Facebook and Follow @MMAWeeklycom on Twitter.
Has Dyson's robotic dream become a reality?Has Dyson finally cracked its 16-year mission to create a robot vacuum cleaner? The company's teaser video hints at a new release which looks a lot like a rival for the best-selling Roomba, and perfectly illustrates how fast the conditions necessary to create viable robotic products are evolving.Dyson's mysterious video, posted on YouTube (below), heralds a 4 September release. The only piece of information to accompany it reads: '16 years. 200 engineers. £28 million investment. The result? Tell us what you think it is.'The device moves around a bit and zooms in and out—interesting, but not as interesting as the glimpse of what looks like its location-analysis technology. It hints at a number of other interesting features too.What's certain is that, with one of the best-known brand names around, Dyson has done its research before going public in a market as hot as robotics is right now.Earlier this year, the company invested £5m in a lab at Imperial College London designed to help robots 'understand and adapt to the world around them,' Then, in an interview in February, company founder Sir James Dyson (pictured) suggested a robotic cleaner might be in the pipeline and would use computer vision to navigate a room.Imperial's Professor Davison has also spoken about the importance of location tracking: "We will research and develop systems that allow machines to both understand and perceive their surroundings – using vision to achieve it," he said. "A truly intelligent domestic robot needs to complete complex everyday tasks while adapting to a constantly changing environment."Dyson is also planning a £250m expansion of one of its UK sites, at Malmesbury, which could provide up to 3,000 new jobs.Prime time for consumer roboticsMore than anything, Dyson's upcoming launch proves that consumer robotics is finally ready for prime time. In a great up-sum of why, published on TechCrunch, computer scientists Rudina Seseri and Wan Li Zhu, who both work for VC 's Fairhaven Capital, explain why the conditions now are perfect."In recent years," they say, "we have seen accelerated levels of innovation in both software and hardware that are now driving new possibilities for consumer readiness and adoption of personal robotics."This as happened on a number of levels:Proliferation of devices, compute, and bandwidth. Instead of requiring expensive custom onboard computing, robots are now able to leverage hardware, smartphones and cloud computing for processing and storage. This has implications on both cost and availability of data for machine perception and learning.Progress in natural language processing, speech, vision and machine learning – a self-reinforcing loop: As machines can better understand the real world, they learn at a faster rate.API-fication of online services. The ability for machines to tap into multiple online data sources and services allows them to quickly stitch together value, reducing time and cost to go to market. Location-based data, financial and weather, and increasingly healthcare data are all examples.They and many others active in the field, also believe that the robotics future won't look much like the current mass-visage of the technology and that, instead, "artificially intelligent devices will take on a multitude of forms where the form factor will more closely match its functions and use case."Many more will be in the form of embedded intelligence within everyday systems we are already familiar with. And soft robotics further promises to open up the number of applications the technology will have.The key, according to Suseri and Zhu, is market acceptance, which will be driven by reliability and safety. In lieu of this, the technology's advance will progress slowly, with interim solutions to pave the way. Cars are in the front line, with incremental modifications such as the sensory-enabled brakes already in the market.With a product launch that has many in the industry on the edge of their seats, Dyson is positioning for a leading part in the coming automation of the home and a major slice of the ripening consumer robotics market. It's also an opportunity for a major UK-based company to show some robot muscle.This article was originally published on RAS SIG – the Robotics and Autonomous Systems Special Interest Group – part of Innovate UK's Knowledge Transfer Network.If you liked this article, you may also be interested in:See all the latest robotics news on Robohub, or sign up for our weekly newsletter.

Over the last two weeks, U.S. President Donald Trump has attacked Syria without congressional approval, ratcheted up the use of force in Afghanistan with a huge bomb, and moved to reverse the Obama administration's policy of releasing White House visitor logs. Each of these actions runs completely counter to the views and values once espoused by Trump on Twitter. And they join an amazingly long — and growing — list of old Trump tweets that have become eerily applicable to Trump's own presidency in ways that scream "hypocrisy."U.S. President Donald Trump has a lot of old tweets that have become eerily applicable to Trump's own presidency in ways that scream "hypocrisy."

On Monday, February 15 at 19:30 GMT:Bernie Sanders is the oldest candidate in the 2016 race for US president. If he makes it all the way to the White House, he'd be the oldest president in the history of the United States. The 74-year-old is the longest serving Independent in the US Congress. Sanders had never registered as a Democrat, and Hilary Clinton was considered by many as the favourite to win. So when he announced his run for the Democratic nomination, many pundits and pollsters thought he stood no chance.Yet, the self-described "Democratic socialist" senator from Vermont has been attracting some of the biggest campaign crowds of any candidate. He's inspired countless hashtags and memes. He's raising a lot of money for his campaign, mostly through small online donations. On social media people engage with Sanders' posts more than any other candidate. Some are even getting Bernie tattoos.He continues to surge in the polls and is winning the support of young Democrats along the way. He recently won the New Hampshire primary with the support of 83 percent of voters ages 18-29.Sanders' campaign is focusing on income and wealth inequality, free college tuition, racial justice, getting big money out of politics, a single-payer health care system, a $15 minimum wage and guaranteed sick time and medical leave for workers.Bernie Sanders' bold ideas has generated enough support for him that he is no longer considered a long shot for winning the Democratic nomination. But is the popularity and support of young people enough to put him on the ticket?Joining this conversation:Michael Moschella @MikeMoschellaPolitical Strategistwww.organizing.centerShaidah Ehehosi @noshaidahBernie Sanders SupporterDaye Pope @daye_popeHillary Clinton SupporterSyreeta McFadden @reetamacOpinion Writer, The Guardian USWhat do you think?

Elizabeth Warren (Screenshot/YouTube)Elizabeth Warren fired back at GOP front-runner Donald Trump, who called her "goofy."Warren, a U.S. senator from Massachusetts and a legal scholar at Harvard Law, laid into Trump on his favorite medium, Twitter, even deploying some of his own tactics against him.SPONSORED"I called out [Donald Trump] on Tuesday. 45 million saw it. He's so confident about his 'counter punch' he waited until Friday night. Lame," Warren tweeted.In response to Warren's Twitter onslaught, Trump called her "goofy," which Warren laughed at in an interview posted by Policy Mic on Wednesday."Really? That's the best you could come up with?" Warren said. "I thought Donald Trump said he was a guy who was good with words."In the interview, Warren also warned that electing Donald Trump will only result in economic inequality."I think it will be more of a government that works for a thin slice at the top, and a government that leaves everyone else behind," she said. "And the problem with that is it's not just government. [G]overnment becomes the tool then to have the economy work that way. So increasingly we live in a world where the economy works for a narrower and narrower slice of America."She added that Washington "works great" if you can afford an army of lobbyists and lawyers and make large campaign contributions.Watch the interview, as posted to YouTube, here:
United Nations: Barring three, the remaining six of the nine places cited by India as addresses of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim in Pakistan have been found to be correct by a UN committee.In evidence to show that Dawood Ibrahim is holed up in Pakistan, a dossier prepared by India had listed nine residences of the underworld don in that country and stated that he is known to frequently change his locations and addresses there.India, in a dossier, had cited the nine addresses as those frequented by Dawood. However, after verification, the six addresses provided by India have not been amended as they have been found to be correct.Out of the three addresses, one that has been dropped as the UN Security Council's Al Qaeda Sanctions Committee found it similar to that of a residence of Islamabad's envoy to the UN Maleeha Lodhi.The Security Council's ISIL and Al-Qaida Sanctions Committee amended its entry on Monday concerning Dawood, the mastermind behind the 1993 Mumbai serial blasts, with "underline and strikethrough".In the amendment, the Committee has stricken through the address "Main Property at Margalla Raod F- 6/2 Street no.22, House No.07, Islamabad number 29 in Karachi. This address was later found to be similar to that of a residence belonging to Lodhi.""The amendment also strikes through other addresses "8th Floor of Mehran Square, near Pardesi House-3, Talwar Area, Clifton, Karachi, Pakistan" and "6/A Kjauabam Tanzeem, Phase-5, Defence Housing Araea, Karachi, Pakistan.""On 22 August 2016, the Security Council Committee pursuant to resolutions 1267 (1999), 1989 (2011) and 2253 (2015) enacted the amendments specified with underline and strikethrough in the entry" concerning Dawood on its ISIL (Da'esh) and Al-Qaida Sanctions List of individuals and entities subject to the assets freeze, travel ban and arms embargo, it said.Dawood's other addresses mentioned in the listing "Karachi, Pakistan (White House, Near Saudi Mosque, Clifton)", "House Nu 37 – 30th Street – defence, Housing Authority, Karachi, Pakistan" and "Palatial bungalow in the hilly area of Noorabad in Karachi" have not been amended.It may be mentioned here that Islamabad has consistently denied that Dawood is living in Pakistan.

The Leptin Diet is the secret to getting more energy from less food. The scientific principles upon which it is based are unlikely to ever change. This is not a fad diet, a calorie manipulation scheme, or a starvation routine masquerading as a diet. It does not involve deprivation of pleasure.The underlying principles of The Leptin Diet apply to everyone, whether you need to lose weight or not. It is a lifestyle for eating properly grounded in the science of leptin. It is something you can do happily and healthfully over the long haul. The Five Rules of the The Leptin Diet: Rule 1: Never eat after dinner. Rule 2: Eat three meals a day. Rule 3: Do not eat large meals. Rule 4: Eat a breakfast containing protein. Rule 5: Reduce the amount of carbohydrates eaten. Let's take a look at each of these rules a little more closely.Allow 11-12 hours between dinner and breakfast. Never go to bed on a full stomach. Finish eating dinner at least three hours before bed. One of leptin's main rhythms follows a 24-hour pattern. Leptin levels are highest in the evening hours. This is because leptin, like the conductor in the orchestra, sets the timing for nighttime repair. It coordinates the timing and release of melatonin, thyroid hormone, growth hormone, sex hormones, and immune system function to carry out rejuvenating sleep. It does this while burning fat at the maximum rate compared to any other time of the day. And it does this only if you will allow it, by not eating after dinner.It is pretty obvious when this isn't working so well. Your extra cravings for food may begin around 4 o'clock in the afternoon and certainly later in the evening. These cravings are powered by a misguided leptin signal to eat, causing strong urges that often overwhelm your will power and self control. If you are in this situation you will find yourself circling the refrigerator and cupboards, like an animal hunting its prey. You will find excuses to obtain food and often will then plop yourself in front of the TV and begin to eat. This is the leptin nightmare, the drive to acquire food even though rationally you know you don't need it. Make every effort to not eat after dinner at night.Allow 5-6 hours between meals. Do not snack. It is vital to create times during the day when small fat blobs, known as triglycerides, are cleared from your blood. If triglycerides build up during the day they physically clog leptin entry into your brain, causing leptin resistance – meaning that leptin cannot register properly in your subconscious command and control center. Your metabolism is not designed to deal with constant eating and snacking. Doing so confuses your metabolism and results in you eating much more than you really need.Eating too often is like a repetitive strain injury, like tennis elbow but in this case leptin elbow. Yes, you are supposed to get a snack between meals – but it is supposed to come from your liver. This is how your body naturally clears triglycerides from your blood. Besides that fact that these fat blobs confuse leptin, they are also headed in the direction of your hips, thighs, and stomach. So breaking them down and clearing them out is vital, and this only happens when you allow 5-6 hours between meals. When you clear your circulatory highways of extra fat during the day then leptin works better. When you do a great job during the day then you are much more likely to break down and burn stored fat from your hips and thighs while you are sleeping. Snacking turns out to be one of the worst things you can do. It doesn't matter how many calories you snack on, when you snack you throw powerful hormonal switches that cause leptin to malfunction. The fictitious idea that snacking is needed to stoke your metabolism or maintain your blood sugar is in no small part behind dietary advice that has helped cause an epidemic of obesity.If you are overweight, always try to finish a meal when slightly less than full, the full signal will usually catch up in 10-20 minutes. Eating slowly is important. As you improve you will start getting full signals at your meals – listen to this internal cue and stop eating.One of the traits of the non-obese French population, that is before the American junk food industry swooped down upon them, is that their
• A version of this post ran on the author's blog, thehavananote.com. The views expressed are the author's own.The US embargo turned 50 years old this week. It probably won't surprise most folks to learn that the night before President John F. Kennedy signed a total US embargo of Cuba into force, he asked an aide to buy 1,000 Cuban cigars (just to be safe, the aide got 1,200).Surely Kennedy would have been shocked to learn that his massive stockpile would run out long before his embargo would; just days before his assassination, Kennedy had approved a secret meeting to take place in Havana between a senior US diplomat and Castro. But the meeting never took place, and Kennedy's embargo has remained a fixture now for half a century. Over at the Daily Mail, Lee Moran offers perspective on this week's milestone:"When the embargo began, American teenagers were doing The Twist, the US had yet to put a man into orbit around the Earth and a first-class US postage stamp cost just 4 cents."How is it that 10 presidents and a Cold War ago, the United States cut off nearly all trade, financial, and aid transactions with 11 million people 90 miles away? Never-ending presidentially declared sanctions such as Kennedy's Cuba embargo had a way of piling up in decades past, long past their utility or relevance. This eventually prompted Congress to reform the authority under which a president could use his emergency international economic (sanctions) powers. After that law passed in 1977, any new sanctions would require oversight and could not just continue in perpetuity. Except the Cuba embargo was grandfathered in with the new law, so, as long as the president declared, every year, the pressing national security interest in continuing it (or, rather, his authority to maintain it), the embargo hung on.President Obama last signed that declaration in September. But seriously, where's the emergency? Fifty years ago, in October 1962, the world came as close to nuclear war as it ever has, when the United States discovered nuclear-armed Soviet missiles in Cuba, initiated a naval blockade, and managed to negotiate an agreement with the Soviets for the missiles' withdrawal. That was clearly an emergency, and a definite threat to the United States.And 50 later? There's not exactly any national interest or emergency compelling the president (well, except for his own re-election fortunes in swing-state Florida) to continue this fossilized policy. If there were one, the just-released "Worldwide Threat Assessment of the US Intelligence Community" failed to mention it. The only threat in Cuba, according to the report, is the internet and its potential for undermining the Cuban government's grip on power.On the contrary, our compelling interests surely lie in dismantling the embargo: it harms the Cuban people (and certainly doesn't help them at all), who would be quick to flood the US in the face of any real destabilization on the island. It invites Havana to embrace countries – Venezuela, Iran, China - that really do more materially threaten or at least challenge our interests. It locks us out of the incipient reform process in Cuba, and could also be hindering its progress as it offers Havana hardliners an easy excuse to maintain tight control. And, most directly counter to our national interest, the embargo hampers swift, routine, effective cooperation on shared interests with a willing partner, whether in fighting drug smuggling, human trafficking, or disaster prevention and mitigation.--- Anya Landau French blogs for The Havana Note, a project of the "US-Cuba Policy Initiative," directed by Ms. Landau French, at the New America Foundation/American Strategy Program.Follow Stories Like This Get the Monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox.5 countries with the longest ongoing US sanctionsGet daily or weekly updates from CSMonitor.com delivered to your inbox.

If you have ducks as pet, you will need to take proper care of them while examining their way of living. Ducks need to have a secure place where they can live and can be safe from any predators and it is easy to clean their housing area. Ducks do not prefer spending time inside their housing area as they prefer roaming outside for most of the time, regardless of the weather or the season.There are many people who want to know how to build a duck pen? If you are looking forward to build a nice yet practical duck pen then you need to follow the guidelines that are discussed below.First of all, you need to make sure that the structure of the duck pen offers proper protection to the ducks and is a defensive structure actually. It is important to keep your ducks safe from other animals and predators. You can allow them to roam about during the day time and lock them later during the night. Ducks love to spend their time in water and you can make a small pool near their pen and allow them to beat the heat of sunny days.The design of duck house is just similar to chicken house design except some minor differences such as it doesn't require roost, nest boxes and need some large door with some steps and it must not be so high from the ground.There are two basic designs of duck coop plans. One is knows as the intensive pen design and the other one is called the semi-intensive design.The intensive pen designThe intensive pen design is structured to keep the ducks safe during the day time and night they are locked totally. The shelter is made quite tough to shield the ducks from any pending danger or threat.The semi-intensive designIn the semi-intensive design the ducks are allowed to roam freely within specified boundaries during the day time.When we talk about chicken coop flooring and bedding material we've several options to explore. While constructing the duck pen it is important to give proper attention towards the flooring. To manage litter and to provide cushion (while they are laying and protecting eggs) a wooden flooring or hay is preferred in most of the cases. Choose a flat area for constructing the duck house but the system of drainage must be very good as you need to prevent the chances of any disease out break or any other health issue. The area of duck pen will depend on the number of ducks that you have actually as you need to provide proper ventilation and sunlight.Just like your house, you need to consider the best material for construction. Wood is the preferable item as it is durable and long lasting. For the shape of the duck pen, you can opt for the rectangular one as it will allow more space to the ducks to roam freely. Duck housing designs will help in giving a comfortable environment to the ducks and they will remain healthy and happy. The entrance and the outer limits of the duck pen need to be designed carefully as with the passage of time ducks will continue to grow and will require more area.How to construct a proper duck pen1- As told above the enclosure needs to be well protected and shaded and it must be dry. If, you are planning to construct a pen on DIY basis you need to select the appropriate wood posts. It means that the dimensions of the plywood must be well suitable for a spacious pen. Other accessories that you will need are tarps, wheelbarrow, gravel, cement, straw bedding, cement blocks, well secured latch, vertical hinges, wire mesh, hardware cloth, staple gun and some heavy duty staples.2- For a common or ideal measurement ground you must allow 11/4 square yards of space for three ducks. The location must be well ventilated and must have the features of a good drainage system. On the floor place a good quality hardware cloth and then place gravels on it and for the last touch you can include the straw bedding. It will provide comfort if you are raising ducklings in the pen.3- While erecting the plywood for the pen, you need to bury them at least two feet deep in solid ground. When the posts have been erected properly you can staple the wire mesh to provide proper fencing. This will prevent invaders from entering the pen through any side once the protection and construction has been done properly. There are different duck house plans and you can choose one according to your requirements, area and the amount of ducks you have.4- Backyard duck pens are very successful for Rearing ducks, that is, if you have ample space and can look after the ducks easily. If you've already chicken coop and thinking about Raising chickens and ducks together in the same coop than it is not a difficult task at all, you will need to plan the pens carefully keeping in view some difference in their housing requirements as discussed above and allow the chickens and ducks ample space. Do keep in mind that in rough environmental conditions chickens love to spend their time indoors.
Your prize cowPersona 4 was a story about acceptance. We all have a dark side, some aspect of our personality we dislike about ourselves, something we choose to repress and hide away from the rest of the world. This isn't the healthiest practice, though. Atlus shows us a cavalcade of otherwise normal, healthy people become consumed by the enemy within. By the time the Investigation Team solves the mystery behind the Inaba murders, it's more than clear that accepting our personal weaknesses, flaws, and undesirable traits are key in becoming a stronger, more successful human being who can connect with others and the world around us.Dancing All Night explores a similar motif, revolving around a group of Rise's peers, a band of pop idols named Kanamin Kitchen, who have been made to lead double lives. Having been manufactured by a record label, these girls are made to act and dress in certain ways that aren't reflective of who they really are. Nobody knows the real them. Deep down, they feel fake and isolated, trapped and forced to conform to public perception, like marionettes dancing for the crowd. All anyone sees is their masks, not the identities they're compelled to conceal, nothing that runs contrary to fantasies held by legions of adoring fans who actually care nothing for them.Yes, in some ways, this is a thought-provoking followup to the themes present in Persona 4. It's also a fun little rhythm game.Persona 4: Dancing All Night (PS Vita)Developer: AtlusPublisher: AtlusReleased: September 29, 2015MSRP: $49.99Taking place shortly after the events of Persona 4, Dancing All Night opens with Rise Kujikawa and a couple members of the gang in a dance studio. The former idol is mounting a comeback and has enlisted her friends as backup dancers to perform at a large music festival. Of course, things quickly go awry. A cursed Internet video has droves of people falling into comas, and to top it all off, members of Kanamin Kitchen, the pop group headed by Rise's frenemy Kanami Mashita, have gone missing.We soon find out the women have been transported to an alternate dimension called the Midnight Stage, where a mysterious voice and hordes of Shadows hold them hostage. Kanamin Kitchen's captors prey on idols' identity crises and try to make them fall in line with the image of what people think believe are, or want them to be, rather than wage any sort of painful personal struggle.The Investigation Team naturally comes to the rescue, except in this world they can't use their Personas to fight. The only way to beat back the Shadows and save Rise and Kanami's friends is to dance. It's a contrived plot device to shoehorn in rhythmic gameplay based on Sega's Hatsune Miku: Project Diva series, but honestly, who cares when the end result is a damn good time?The mechanics at work here are nothing revolutionary. Notes appear in the center of a circle and fly outward toward six zones on circle's perimeter in formations based on music. Players are tasked with keeping the beat, the success or failure of which will determine things like high scores, whether new levels are unlocked, and earn in-game currency for purchasing items and costumes.Dancing All Night functions perfectly, and its three main difficulty settings all feel appropriately challenging. Regardless of which you choose, a poor performance will result in a quick hook, though a mediocre one may allow you to complete a level without passing. This can be a powerful motivator, and definitely kept me coming back to some of the tougher stages. On top of the standard fare, there's also an even harder (hidden) difficulty setting awaiting dedicated players. So good luck with that!Aside from the joy of watching familiar faces like Teddie and Chie cavort around in ridiculous outfits, what makes Dancing All Night a blast is the music itself. One of my favorite aspects of the Persona series is composer Shoji Meguro's handiwork, which is obviously thrust into the spotlight this time around. After completing both the story and free dance modes (plus redeeming some downloadable content) I've unlocked 36 songs, spanning everything from original Persona 4 tracks to spin-off theme songs and even a live performance. However, while that may conceptually seem like a decent-sized selection, it doesn't always feel that way.Half of the soundtrack is padded out with remixes that may or may not resonate with players. While I absolutely loved many of them, there are others I will seldom play again. I found it difficult at times to appreciate versions of songs I've adored for years, only to have some DJ somewhere strip the track of nearly all its personality and transform it into something else entirely.Dancing All Night's uneven score wasn't the only facet of the experience that wasn't as compelling
La Cultural Leonesa. La madre que me parió. pic.twitter.com/IRv5U1Shmh — Fran Guillén (@guillenfran) July 31, 2014Spanish team Cultural Leonesa caused a bit of a stir earlier this month when they unveiled a 'tuxedo' style kit for the new season.Some thought it was photoshopped, some claimed it was a marketing stunt and other plainly suggested it was a joke that would never grace the pitch.But Spanish football writer Fran Guillen has posted this snap from Leonesa's latest match, which proves not only does it actually exist, but it's totally glorious.Most of the players in the squad picture don't seem too convinced, but we're absolutely in love with this super smart look, even if the socks do kind of ruin it.Still, just look at the goalkeeper kit!Glorious.MORE: You will want Ayr's new kit after seeing this advert

Two weeks ago, a group of students at the University of California at Irvine removed a U.S. flag from a common area of the student government suite.Shortly afterwards, six undergraduate members of the Associated Students Council of UCI passed a resolution banning the display of the flags of any nation in the office lobby. The resolution was authored by student Matthew Guevara of the School of Social Ecology.Among the reasons the legislative council objected to the American flag were:--"The American flag has been flown in instances of colonialism and imperialism."--"A common ideological understanding of the United States includes American exceptionalism and superiority."--"Designing a culturally inclusive space is taken seriously by ASUCI."--"The removal of barriers is the best option at promoting an inclusive space."--"It is a psychological effect for individuals to identify negative aspects of a space rather than positive ones."--"Freedom of speech, in a space that aims to be as inclusive as possible can be interpreted as hate speech."Two days later a higher ranking student panel, the executive cabinet of ASUCI, vetoed the ban.But the issue did not end there.The hostility that the original legislative council vote engendered -- including, reportedly, death threats -- was used by over a thousand students and dozens of professors as a reason to sign a petition supporting the original ban on the flag.In the words of the petition:"The resolution recognized that nationalism, including U.S. nationalism, often contributes to racism and xenophobia, and that the paraphernalia of nationalism is in fact often used to intimidate. This is a more or less uncontroversial scholarly point. ..."We admire the courage of the resolution's supporters amid this environment of political immaturity and threat, and support them unequivocally."These are the facts. Now to what I believe is the most important question regarding the resolution to ban the flag and the petition on behalf of the resolution: Why were they supported?Here are three reasons:1. Outside of the natural sciences, math, and a few other departments, our universities are essentially seminaries -- teaching what has been the most dynamic religion of the Western world over the past hundred years, leftism. Every -- frequently incoherent -- idea expressed by the resolution and the petition represents years of left-wing indoctrination. Respect for the American flag comes naturally; reasons to hold it in contempt have to be learned.It is not surprising that the author of the resolution is a student at UC Irvine's School of Social Ecology. Visit its website and you will see leftism in one of its purest forms.2. The students and the professors see themselves as citizens of the world. Leftism rejects nationalism, and the most nationalistic of the industrialized Western democracies is America. The left regards nationalism -- as symbolized by hanging or waving the American flag -- as primitive and ultimately fascistic.3. Many professors and students are bored. Compared to the past anywhere and compared to the present almost anywhere, life in America is remarkably easy for the vast majority of college students and college professors.This ease, however, presents them with another problem -- a lack of meaning in life. For nearly all people there has never been a problem with finding meaning. Even putting aside religion -- humanity's greatest supplier of meaning -- life's difficulties have always given people meaning: How will I feed myself and my family? How will I provide myself and my family with a home?But these problems exist for almost no American college student and they do not exist for any American professor. And since so few professors, and increasingly few students, derive meaning from America's traditional Judeo-Christian religions, meaning must be sought and found elsewhere.Thus the left generally and the universities in particular manufacture crises that give the secular middle and upper classes great meaning: fight American sexism, intolerance, xenophobia, homophobia, Islamophobia, racism, material inequality, capitalism and nationalism.That America is in fact the most open, opportunity-giving and tolerant country in world history is irrelevant to these people. To acknowledge this would be to deprive themselves of the greatest human need after food -- meaning and purpose.These are the reasons they want to ban the American flag. That hundreds of thousands of Americans died for what this flag represents -- the American trinity of liberty, In God We Trust and E Pluribus Unum -- means nothing to these students and professors. Thanks to leftism, when they see the American flag they see imperialism and bigotry.
This article is going viral, having been shared on Xenosystems, Slate Star Codex, and elsewhere: Has Western-style democracy become too expensive for capitalism?This short article offers a lot to unpack.The central reason why Western democracy is in decline is that its capitalist bedfellow can no longer afford the financial demands that full-blown democracy is placing upon it. History has shown that capitalism can adapt, consorting with a variety of political systems in the past 5,000 years. Looking ahead, it will probably find another political host to aid its survival. Democracy — capitalism's host over the past century — is far more brittle. …Much ink has been spilled on the significance of 2016's one-two populist punches as thrown by Brexit then Trump. What does it mean for the West? Most analysis concludes that parts of the West are having second thoughts about globalisation, and there is undoubted — if only partial — merit in this assessment.Donald Trump won the US presidential election by convincing disgruntled former factory workers in the critical swing Rust Belt states of Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio and Pennsylvania that factories translocated from the US to Mexico and China had "stolen" middle class jobs from Middle America. A few factories have migrated, though the main effect of Asian and Mexican competition has been to limit wage increases much more than "steal" jobs.There is a trend these days for authors on supposedly reputable sites (Bloomberg, Financial Times, and The Economist) to make these grand proclamations but with scarcely any proof to support them. Technically, all you need are two data points to call something a trend, which in this case is Brexit and Trump. The Financial Times, purportedly reputable newspaper, is going down the same path as Zero Hedge and Rolling Stone by using sensationalism and over-generalizations for cheap ad clicks at the cost of accuracy and journalistic integrity.Anther possibly, as I discuss here, is that these results don't signify anything significant, due to the high degree of randomness. Half the county is going to vote 'left', the other 'right', so it comes down to a small number of undecided voters. The author ignores the French and Dutch elections and how Theresa May lost seats, all of which puts a dent in the thesis.There is growing anti-democratic sentiment online, but it will take longer for this to manifest in real life.The second is that the centre of economic gravity is shifting back from West to East. The connection between these two mega trends is that, although the East has flirted with democracy, its new champions are not democratic nor are there indications that they are likely to be, at least in the sense that the West regards the concept. Only India's ascendancy might yet give Western-style democracy a second chance and a new lease on life.Again with the overgeneralizing and baseless suppositions. According to what evidence? There is scant evidence of such a shift. Of the 2000 largest companies, 540 of them are based in the US, whereas only 200 are in China. The biggest and most influential companies in the world–Google, Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Exxon, Tesla, and Walmart–were all founded in America. Maybe the author is referring to China's manufacturing, which has long since eclipsed that of the United States.What does the author mean by 'too expensive'? This can mean two things: costs of living being to expensive for Americans, which for things such as rent, healthcare, and tuition, costs have exceeded inflation, and or, it can mean 'expensive' in terms of excessive entitlement spending due to ill-conceived social and immigration policies.As McKinsey has noted, almost 70 per cent of households in the 25 most advanced economies — some 560m people — have seen their real incomes stay flat or fall since 2005.Yet despite stagnant real wages for most workers, Americans have a lot of purchasing power, especially compared to the United Kingdom. (Related: Stagnant Inflation-Adjusted US Wages: Putting Things in Perspective) Americans, even the poorest, have a lot of purchasing power. In most counties, standards of living for the poor and middle class are much worse. Look at Walmart and how much cheap stuff there is there–a week's worth of an American's paycheck buys more economic utility than for someone living in Britain. The British pay a higher percentage of their income for heating, utilities, transportation, and other essential goods.In fact, these surpluses have been insufficient since before WWII. But the stop-gap measures of Keynesian-inspired budget deficits — the real glue of democratic capitalist cohabitation — have made up the necessary differences even if these debt-financed transfers inexorably added to overall national debt.This passage alluding to socialism via democracy, the result being an increasing amount of debt to pay for entitlement spending–due to politicians supporting more immigration to expand the electorate,

Monday, January 11th, 2016 will forever be equated with the day that our Aliyah ended. After ten years of building a life for ourselves, ingraining our family into a community and integrating into Israeli life, one miserable eye-opening day made us question our decision to live out our lives in Zion and take stock as to why we are really here. Whether we move back is inconsequential, what matters here is that the belief we held in the State of Israel was demolished with the reality that the land we live in is not free nor just and without major reforms it never will be for the millions of people who call this place home.What happened to us, as I found out is not uncommon in this country. While the circumstances and specific details are different, the fact that the Israel Police overstepped their bounds and turned our lives upside down is not. At six o'clock in the morning on that day the police barged into our home, woke our children and proceeded to tear our home apart. With little explanation and a presumption of guilt they meticulously went through our home in search of illicit drugs. They flashed a warrant which gave them the legal right to do so, however were not particularly interested in respecting our property or us for that matter as they executed their duty.During the search they sequestered me and my fourteen year old daughter, strip searched me when I had asked if I could put on some pants and proceeded to ask where our stash was. We were accused of growing a forest of marijuana and distributing it to kids in Modi'in, the city in which we have lived for the past 9 plus years. One look at our large garden and it should have been obvious right then and there that there was no growing operation, however this did not deter them. Assuming harvest season was over they poked their noses into every corner of our home, every box, every cabinet without care for the valuables which we cherished.Upon realizing that there was not even a crumb of anything illicit, no paraphernalia even for recreational use and no evidence to substantiate their theory, they proceeded to detain me and my young daughter and brought us to the station for interrogation – or what they call investigation. There is no distinction between the two when it comes to the methods they employed. Upon entering the car they told me not to speak to my daughter and slapped me when I ignored those instructions. As stoic as she was she is still fourteen and will forever be my baby, I will always ignore those orders especially when I see her teary eyed and scared.What occurred over the course of the next twelve hours was something out of a movie, even today it is all quite surreal. My daughter was sequestered from me and interrogated without representation. I was put in leg and arm shackles and shuffled from place to place, outside and in the station for several hours without telling me why. I was demanding that I see my daughter, where I come from you cannot simply interrogate a minor without a parent or attorney, however the more I persisted in my demands the more harsh their treatment towards me became.I was as cooperative as I could be. Our phones and computers were confiscated and I offered them the lock codes without even being asked for them – we were not running a drug operation from our home and I had nothing to hide. However even still they acted as if there was evidence to the contrary throughout the day in an attempt to get me to confess to something that was simply not close to being true. I had asked that I be interrogated in English as my Hebrew is fair, not great – I was not. When presented with a document to sign and said I have poor Hebrew reading skills my head was smashed onto the papers with the hard table underneath and asked if that helped me in my ability to read them. When I asked for an attorney after several hours of some physical and a lot of verbal abuse I was denied this request, told that I will have time later to speak with him.I did not even know what was going on with my daughter, had no idea where my family was or what was transpiring outside and did not know I even had a lawyer I could talk to. My wife was at the station with our oldest daughter trying to get the lead investigator to speak with the attorney she had hired that morning. The arresting officer shoved my daughter to the ground, grabbed her phone and hung up on the attorney. To say that every member of my family experienced some abuse that day is to minimize the event, no one was safe that day.What I realized during my time in chains was that the police are either above the law or do not have any to follow. By mid-afternoon I was finally allowed to speak with my attorney, as much as his words were meant to be soothing my ordeal was ongoing and I did not take it as such. I was told that if they take me to prison that day I will have to see a judge within 24 hours and when that happens
Brown: Emanuel backing 4 percent surcharge on Airbnb billsAnother week, another homeless initiative from Mayor Rahm Emanuel.Last week, it was a pilot program to find housing for 75 homeless people camped under Lake Shore Drive viaducts.This week, he's signing on to a proposal by Chicago aldermen to double his proposed surcharge on house-sharing businesses like Airbnb, with the proceeds to be used to provide services for the homeless.The resulting 4 percent surcharge on the bills of house-sharing guests would initially bring in more than $2 million annually for homeless programs, with an expectation of added revenue in the future as the emerging industry grows, administration officials say.The dedicated local revenue stream, long sought by advocates for the homeless, will be "groundbreaking," the mayor promised in an interview.OPINIONSo what gives? Has Emanuel grown a heart, or is he just trying to prove there was one there all along?I'm not sure. Politics most likely, though, to be fair, he's been pretty good on many housing issues.The explanation might be this simple: Finding more money to help the homeless will likely help the mayor gain whatever additional aldermanic support he needs for his underlying proposal to regulate the house-sharing industry.Emanuel said he plans to move forward in May with the ordinance, though he still faces opposition from multiple parties.In a replay of the "new economy" battle playing out between taxi companies and ride-sharing services like Uber, hotel interests object on grounds that Emanuel's regulations are too easygoing on the tech-based lodging services. They contend that some of the house-sharing companies operate what in effect are unregulated hotels that unfairly compete with them.The real estate industry also has concerns. The Chicago Association of Realtors says tenants and condo owners should be required to submit affidavits attesting they have permission from their landlords or condo associations to rent their units. The underlying point: Many apartment and condo dwellers who already house-share don't have such permission.Airbnb is also displeased. The company argued the proposed 2 percent surcharge Emanuel unveiled in January was unfair to middle-class people renting out their homes on weekends. Doubling it to 4 percent doubles that unhappiness.Despite those hurdles, Emanuel said: "I have no doubt we're going to pass the ordinance."I have no position on the underlying Airbnb ordinance without more study.But I think it's a great idea to direct revenue from this new industry to homeless people, given the roundabout probability the Airbnbs of the world are going to further contribute to housing displacement.There's definitely a need for revenue. Even if the city can cobble together funding to provide housing for homeless people, federal and state budget cuts have decimated the services needed to help them stay there.Those can include mental health treatment , substance abuse counseling and job-readiness training.Emanuel's original proposal directed the money to homeless families. With the need to address growing homeless encampments, some funds will be switched there, he said.Ald. Ameya Pawar (47th), who teamed with Ald. James Cappleman (46th) on the idea of doubling the surcharge for homeless services, said doing so was enough to secure his support for the Airbnb ordinance."I think this is a good balance," Pawar said.The Chicago Coalition for the Homeless also supports the surcharge plan.Administration officials said the mayor remains open to considering further changes based on other concerns raised by aldermen but rejects Ald. Brendan Reilly's position that the administration should scrap its proposal and instead enforce the stricter vacation rental ordinance that took effect in 2011.After two weeks of our making nice, the mayor assures me he will do something in the coming week for which I can criticize him. I told him I look forward to it.
Jump to contentQ From Martin Turner, Hong Kong: A simple question, but it's bothering me. Where does crib come from in the sense of a cheat's answer sheet or illicitly copying somebody else's work? It's listed as the same word as the baby's bed, but the connection is beyond me.A It is the same word, though you may not be surprised to hear that a lot more lies behind it. The use of the term for a baby's cot is more common in US English than in Britain, where it's mainly reserved for a model of the Nativity of Christ, with a manger as a bed. The verb to crib in the sense of plagiarism or stealing another's schoolwork is mainly British English, though both US and British English know crib notes. Both varieties of English share the sense of a barred container or rack for animal fodder, a manger. This is the original, which turns up in English around the year 1000 and which is from an Old German word whose descendants are to be found in modern Dutch and German.One sense of crib.There are other senses of crib, especially that of a small house, cabin or hovel (from an extension of the sense of an animal stall), which eventually led to the meaning in the South Island of New Zealand of a small house at the seaside or at a holiday resort, to thieves' slang of the early nineteenth century for a house, shop or public-house and to the slightly later US slang usage for a saloon, a low dive, or brothel (and also the current US Black English sense of one's room, house or apartment). The baby's bed doesn't arrive until the seventeenth century as an application of the barred container idea, others from the same source being a repository for hops during harvest and a wickerwork basket or pannier. A shift from container to contents may explain why it has sometimes meant a light meal or a workman's lunch, though it's also suggested that an eighteenth-century slang sense of the stomach may be the direct link.The basket sense was used in particular for one in which a poacher might conceal his catch. The experts guess this may have led to the thievery sense around the middle of the eighteenth century. Much rests on an appearance in Samuel Foote's play The Nabob of 1778: "A brace of birds and a hare, that I cribbed this morning out of a basket of game." The plagiarism sense arrived at around the same time, though it seems to have become applied to stealing another's school work only in the following century.
Furious owner of a Mercedes-Benz S63 AMG has literally demolished his luxury vehicle with a golf club.A low-res video shows a 33-year-old man with his S63 AMG, protesting the poor service of his local Chinese Mercedes-Benz dealership by smashing the vehicle with a golf club. The man had the car's engine failing for three times and the seller reportedly promised to exchange it if this happens again.When the engine failed again during a family trip, the owner got back to the dealership, where he was told by workers that nothing can be done until their boss returns from a business trip.

New York Rangers defenseman Kevin Klein will be sidelined three to four weeks with an upper-body injury, the team announced Thursday. Although the Rangers did not reveal the nature of the injury, Newsday reported it could be a fractured arm.Klein was hit in the left arm by a shot from Capitals captain Alex Ovechkin during the Rangers' 3-1 victory at Washington on Wednesday. X-rays were taken after the game, and Klein returned to New York on Thursday to be further evaluated by a team physician.MORE: Graphic Guide to Season | Isles take calculated risk with Boychuk extension | GoPro video of Lundqvist in goalA four-week recovery would put him on track to be available for the start of the Stanley Cup playoffs.The 11-year-veteran has established career highs with nine goals and 26 points in 65 games this season while averaging 18:29 of ice time per game.

In the fall of 1962, whilst The Birds was in post-production, François Truffaut carried out extensive interviews with Alfred Hitchcock at his offices at Universal Studios. The interviews were recorded to audio tape and the content eventually edited down into Truffaut's Hitchcock book.Although Truffaut could speak a little English, he hired Helen Scott (of the French Film Office in New York) to act as the translator for the interviews.Truffaut had intended to quickly publish the book of the interviews, but the first edition wasn't published until several years later (1966 in France and 1967 in America). To bring the book up-to-date, Truffaut conducted further interviews to discuss Marnie and Torn Curtain.In 1984, Patricia Hitchcock donated a set of the interview tapes to the Margaret Herrick Library, where they are now part of the Hitchcock Collection. Although Truffaut claimed that the recordings lasted 50 hours, the surviving tapes — which cover the 1962 interviews — last for less than 26 hours.Research by Janet Bergstrom[1] has made clear the fact that the book often does not contain a verbatim transcript of Hitchcock's responses to Truffaut's questions...Certain categories of information seem to have been omitted from the published interview for reasons over and above the need to keep the page count down or omit Hitchcock's slightly off–color jokes and descriptions of individuals that might offend them or even prove libelous. Information was dropped that would be considered precious today, particularly by film historians: explanations of technique were greatly limited compared to the original, references to television and the film industry as such, including observations about people who were not necessarily well–known and what they did, as Hitchcock remembered this or that film or phase of his career.The interviews were used as the basis of Alain Riou and Stéphane Boulan's French stage play Hitch: When Truffaut Confronted Hitchcock.AudioThe audio tapes of the interviews have not been released commercially. However, portions of the tapes were used for a French radio broadcast by the station "France Culture".[2]French Radio BroadcastNearly 12 hours of the interviews were broadcast on French radio as a 25 part series.

An economics professor says his flight was delayed because a fellow passenger thought the equations he was writing might be a sign he was a terrorist.American Airlines confirmed on Saturday that a woman expressed suspicions about a University of Pennsylvania economics professor, Guido Menzio. She said she was too ill to take the Air Wisconsin-operated flight.Menzio was flying from Philadelphia to Syracuse on Thursday to give a talk at Queen's University in Ontario, Canada. He was solving a differential equation, but said he was told the woman thought he might be a terrorist because of what he was writing.American spokesman Casey Norton said the crew followed protocol to take care of an ill passenger and then to investigate her allegations. They determined them to be non-credible, he said.On Facebook, Menzio recounted the "unbelievable" experience in the present tense. "The passenger sitting next to me calls the stewardess, passes her a note."The plane, ready to take off, then returned to the gate and the passenger left. Menzio was then asked to disembark the plane and "met by some FBI looking man-in-black"."They ask me about my neighbor," he wrote. "I tell them I noticed nothing strange. They tell me she thought I was a terrorist because I was writing strange things on a pad of paper. I laugh. I bring them back to the plane. I showed them my math."Menzio told the Washington Post that he was "treated respectfully throughout" the process but remains perturbed by a system that "relies on the input of people who may be completely clueless".
In what witnesses are describing as a horrific scene, former All Black Joe Karam has been found dead along with a number of other prominent Bain supporters, including lawyer Michael Reed and retired Canadian judge Ian Binnie, in the Christchurch home of David Bain.Police say there were five victims in total, but have yet to name the remaining two.The deceased were reportedly meeting with Bain to discuss plans for the ongoing compensation claim concerning his now-overturned conviction of killing his family in 1994. Bain had allowed the five supporters to stay the night, and they were discovered dead early this morning, each in different rooms and with fresh bullet wounds.Police say that the lone survivor of the killings, David Bain, was horrified to discover the men's bodies after returning home from his morning paper round.Bain says he entered the home at around 8:20am, before absent-mindedly walking past several of the deceased on his way to the laundry. Here he discovered a pile of bloodied clothes, which he carefully washed before returning to his living room to fully realise that all his friends were dead.Bain then made a frantic 111 call, telling the operator "Help. They're all dead. My friends, they're all dead. Hurry up."After conducting a full survey of the scene, police discovered Karam's body in the living room next to a large hunting rifle, as well as a message left on Bain's home computer that read "Sorry you are the only one who deserved to stay."Police Detective Inspector Dave Long said that while the investigation was still thoroughly underway, the person responsible for the killings should be "plainly obvious.""We're not willing to draw absolute conclusions at this stage, but it does appear likely to us that Karam, for some reason, has turned on his fellow Bain supporters," he said. "He's taken Bain's hunting rifle, he's shot the rest of them, and then he's gone and changed out of his bloodied murder clothes and put them in the wash."He's then walked into the living room, probably spent a good half-hour to an hour trying to get that rifle against his head, pulled the trigger, he's dead. Now Bain comes home, sees a few dead bodies, makes his way to the laundry to do the washing like he always does. Finds a bloody pile of clothes, washes them, because, well, they're filthy."He then makes his way into the living room, sits down, turns on the TV, and a little while later, suddenly notices that everyone is dead."Long said it made sense because Karam "loved Bain," and that's probably why he let him live.Bain was not expected to be charged following the incident.

Today has brought us tracklists for two anticipated upcoming rap albums, and they couldn't be more different. Kendrick Lamar's DAMN. features only two guests—Rihanna and U2—who, aside from whatever they contribute musically, function as enviable status symbols. Logic's Everybody, meanwhile, sports a deep, bizarre, and intriguing cast of characters—and that's only the beginning.Rappers often seem to operate with a pack mentality when it comes to collaborations. There's always a certain group of artists it feels like show up on more rap albums than not in a given time period. Recently, that group has included Future, Young Thug, Migos, 2 Chainz, Ty Dolla $ign, etc. There's nothing wrong with this, exactly—all of those artists are great, and placing any of them in a new context allows us to hear them in a way we might not otherwise, as Drake did in coaxing a uniquely personal verse out of Young Thug on More Life's "Sacrifices." But it also means that the ever dwindling supply of actual rap "albums" can feel interchangeable, a trend that mirrors the industry's consolidation as a whole.The new album by Logic, a 27-year-old rapper from Maryland, will not have that problem. Everybody, his third official release on Def Jam, looks like this:What an objectively incredible collection of words! Killer Mike, Black Thought, Chuck D, Juicy J. A song called "Black SpiderMan" featuring Broadway actor Damian Lemar Hudson. "AfricAryaN" featuring Neil deGrasse Tyson. A song featuring Ansel Elgort and a song title that is just the National Suicide Prevention Hotline. Could those last two be related?Still, this is only scratching the surface. As you can see at the top of the image, Everybody is billed as "starring" the celebrity astrophysicist Tyson and BIGVON, a longtime DJ and radio personality on 106 KMEL, the premier rap station in the Bay Area. Logic's image doesn't state what exactly "starring" means, but retweeted something that, well…In an interview explaining the album with the site Hard Knock TV, Logic explains that the album was inspired by the novel The Martian, which is about an astronaut stranded on Mars who has to improvise his way back to Earth. (You may have seen the movie starring Matt Damon.) Logic says that he contacted the book's author, Andy Weir, to get his permission to loosely base his album around the book, to which Weir said yes. "I had the idea to do the skits," Logic says of the album's structure. "But then it hit me: What if I actually rapped from the perspective of all the lives this guy is living?" A great question indeed.In the interview, Logic talks at length about how he doesn't think anyone should draw lines around his music, and, you know, as someone who is not a fan of his music, I agree. More albums with Ansel Elgort and Killer Mike on back-to-back songs. At least from this one guy.
President Trump on Thursday quietly changed the order of succession at the Justice Department, wiping out an order issued by former President Obama days before leaving office.The change was made in an executive order published Friday on the White House website, one of the few Trump did not sign in a photo op.The order was first reported by USA TodayADVERTISEMENTBecause Sessions's deputies have not been confirmed, he would be succeeded by Dana Boente, U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia.Trump picked Boente, an Obama appointee, as acting attorney general after he fired acting Attorney General Sally Yates because she refused to defend his travel ban in court.After Boente, the position would fall to Zachary Fardon, the U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Illinois; and then to U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Missouri Tammy Dickinson.Obama changed the order of succession one week before he left office, placing the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia behind the department's senior leadership. Below Fardon was the U.S. attorney for the Central District of California.Trump did not change the top of the succession order, which includes the deputy attorney general, the associate attorney general and "any officers designated by the attorney general."

Kendrick Perkins | Center | #21 Team: Cleveland Cavaliers Age / DOB: (33) / 11/10/1984 Ht / Wt: 6'10' / 270 College: None Drafted: 2003 / Rd. 1 (27) / MEM Share: TweetLatest News Recent NewsThe Cavs have waived Kendrick Perkins. Perkins was picked up during Cleveland's postseason run to serve as an emergency depth guy, but with the Cavs likely going into a rebuilding phase, there's no incentive to keep him around. Source: Adrian Wojnarowski on TwitterThe Cavs will pick up Kendrick Perkins' $2.5 million team option for 2018-19, with the intent of packaging him in a trade. Cleveland can still waive Perkins if he isn't traded, so this just gives them financial flexibility if they need to match salaries for a big fish. It's indicative of their desire to add a big-name player to lure LeBron James back to Cleveland. Source: ESPN.comKendrick Perkins got into a shouting match with Drake on the way to the locker room at halftime on Tuesday, and then got into another exchange of words with the rapper after the game. "What happened was I was talking to my old teammate Serge (Ibaka) walking into halftime telling him 'We about to win this game,' and Drake butted in talking [stuff] to me," Perkins texted to ESPN after the game. "So I said something back to him." In case you missed it, Perk is on the Cavaliers playoff roster, but wasn't active for tonight's game. Perkins' basketball game isn't worth much these days, but he's not a guy most human beings should be picking a fight with, in our opinion. Source: Ardrian Wojnarowski on Twitter
The International Monetary Fund repeatedly succumbed to political pressure from European governments during the eurozone debt crisis, according a damning internal report on bailout strategy that will fuel debate over whether it should continue to fund Greece.In-house inspectors highlighted a litany of flaws in the IMF's "uneven" response, prompting calls for greater clarity over the fund's rescue strategy for eurozone countries.Their assessment raises fresh questions over the failure to restructure Greek debt at the time of its first bailout in 2010. The report, released on Thursday, said key decisions had already been reached in Europe by the time the fund became involved in the rescue effort.Christine Lagarde, the IMF's managing director since 2011, backed some of the inspectors' recommendations for improving internal procedures but dismissed calls from the independent evaluation office (IEO) to fortify the fund's defences against political interference."I support the principle that the IMF's technical analysis should remain independent," she said in a statement. "However, I do not accept the premise of the recommendation, which the IEO failed to establish in its report, and thus do not see the need to develop new procedures."The fund's involvement in eurozone programmes had been a "qualified success" in the face of unprecedented systemic challenge, Ms Lagarde said.Nonetheless, the report is likely to fan suspicions of some emerging market IMF shareholders and some of its staff that it repeatedly bent its own rules to help out the eurozone."It highlights the concerns of many — both inside and outside the fund – that the fund's treatment of developing and emerging market economies is quite different from its treatment of advanced economies," said Eswar Prasad, economics professor at Cornell University and former IMF official."Political factors seemed to play a bigger role than pure technical considerations in matters involving advanced economies."The inspectors said the troika arrangement — in which the IMF worked alongside the European Commission and European Central Bank — potentially subjected the technical judgment of IMF staff "to political pressure" from an early stage."The European Commission, in the area of emergency crisis lending, acted as the agent of the eurogroup, which in turn represented member states and decided whether to provide assistance."Interviews and some internal documents suggest that political feasibility in creditor countries was an important consideration for [European Commission] staff and that IMF staff occasionally felt pressured to accept a less-than-ideal outcome.The inspectors said the IMF executive board, responsible for the fund's day-to-day business, was in the dark on sensitive policy questions for Greece and Ireland, which also received a bailout in 2010.Some executive board members, who usually meet several times each week, learned more from the press throughout the crisis period than from informal board meetings.The board approved the first Greek deal in May 2010 "without seeking pre-emptive debt restructuring, even though its sovereign debt was not deemed sustainable with a high probability"."The risk of contagion was an important consideration in coming to this decision. The IMF's policy on exceptional access to fund resources, which mandates early board involvement, was followed only in a perfunctory manner."The fiscal troubles of Greece remain unresolved, fanning concern about regional instability at a time of upheaval in Turkey. In recent days the US has pressed the country's European creditors to allow a debt restructuring to restore order in its finances.The inspectors, led by Japanese academic Shinji Takagi, found the IMF had considered the prospect of lending to a eurozone country to be unlikely and had never set out how such programmes might be designed.Related article Turkish turmoil strengthens case for Greek debt relief, says US US Treasury secretary says Greece should be anchor of regional stabilityThe report said IMF managers had moved some time before the Greek rescue to explore contingencies. Still, the work of special task forces "was so secret that few within the institution knew of their existence, let alone the content of their deliberations".Ms Lagarde said IMF-backed programmes bought time to build firewalls, prevented the crisis from spreading, and restored growth and market access in Ireland, Portugal and Cyprus."Greece, however, was unique: while initial economic targets proved overly ambitious, the programme was beset by recurrent political crises, pushback from vested interests, and severe implementation problems that led to a much deeper-than-expected output contraction."On the other hand, Greece undertook enormous adjustment with unprecedented assistance from its international partners. This enabled Greece to remain a member of the euro area — a key goal for Greece and the euro area members."Chronicle of a crisisOct 2009: George Papandreou's Socialist party wins the Greek elections.

Florida is moving fast in its pursuit of Mississippi State athletics director Scott Stricklin to fill the same position in Gainesville.According to a report from The Clarion-Ledger, Florida made a second offer to Stricklin on Tuesday after he turned down a previous one earlier this month. Reports surfaced earlier Tuesday claiming Stricklin had emerged as the lead candidate for the position.Current Gators athletic director Jeremy Foley announced in June his plan to step down from the position Oct. 1, though he intends to remain with the school in an emeritus role. The National Association of College Directors of Athletics in March named Stricklin the 2015-2016 Under Armour Athletics Director of the Year.
NEW DELHI: Four proposed power sub-stations which can end electricity crisis in the national capital have failed to see the light of day as land has not been allocated to even one of them by Delhi government, Power Minister Piyush Goyal said today.The Minister said once these four substations at Rajghat, Tughlakabad, Dwarka and Karampura are ready, the Centre could bring in 7,400 MW of power to Delhi, which is substantially higher than estimated demand even in the next few years."I met the Power Minister of Delhi Satyendra Jain and he agreed to resolve the matter, and ensure land availability by working with all stakeholders."I am hopeful that the land will be allotted to PGCIL on mutually agreeable terms expeditiously and work will begin at the earliest, so that people of Delhi are not forced to suffer power cuts in future," Goyal said in a blog written by him on completion of one year as the Union Power Minister.Power Grid Corporation of India Limited (PGCIL) plans to construct four 400/220 KV power substations each of capacity 2000 MVA at Rajghat, Tughlakabad, Dwarka and Karampura, "but land has not been allotted land for even one of them," Goyal said.The Union Minister added that he had to face power crisis in Delhi just three days after assuming the charge and even his residence did not have power in night at that time last year. AAP had abdicated its responsibility in government, and we could not see Delhi and Delhiites suffer the ignominy of the National Capital being out of power. Hence we immediately swung into action and took up restoration activities on a war-footing..." he said.After handling the power crisis, the Centre started working on "inverter and generator-mukt Delhi", Goyal said and added the Power Ministry subsequently finalised and started implementing a Rs 7,791 crore plan for upgradation of the city's power systems for "a robust, reliable and secure transmission infrastructure for the long-term".
"We just can't have everybody in the intelligence community, they have such power to suck up every bit of every transmission, every communication we ever made, we can't just have them willy-nilly releasing that to the public," Paul said on "Fox & Friends."
Over the course of your life, folks are going to tell you what to do… over and over again. Color within the lines; avoid risk; be a good boy scout.Some of this will be well intentioned; many think you'll fare better if you don't rock the boat. Others are ass-faces who find reassurance in knowing that they're not the only ones who chose the safe path.The plan goes like this: study hard, get good grades, attend a respected university, find a decent job, work your way up the ladder, procreate (twice), and upgrade your home every 5 – 10 years. All of which are fine, but this is just one course amongst many.What if there's another way?What if you dropped out of school and walked across the country? What if you decided grades were sort of silly, and instead read all the interesting things you could find? What if you volunteered some time in a developing country and met someone who'd never spent a moment thinking about Chandler and Monica? What if you tasted every taste, saw every sight, faced the things that frightened you, and got a couple of scuffs along the way?You have one life. Live it as you will, but perhaps take a moment to consider an alternative path. There is a wide chasm between the ways you could pass through existence and the lame-ass lives most choose. Besides, should you fail, you'll at least have a couple of good stories to tell.Do whatever you want. I'm not here to prescribe life decisions. At the same time, I feel it's worth reminding you that within 100 years you, and everyone you love, will be gone. All the shit you're stressing out about will be long forgotten.The swarm of convention is a tsunami that absorbs all in its way. You are powerless against it. (Until you decide you are not.)
Description of The IEEEgo BlockExtroverted Intuition (Ne, )IEEs are predominantly motivated by their feelings of interest and boredom. They are attracted to novel ideas, unusual or peculiar goings-on in day-to day life, and new experiences. They may have a tendency to frequently engage themselves in novel life "projects," which can and often consist of novel concepts or fields of thought, new activities, and new lifestyles (this list is not all-inclusive). These types of projects often take the form of activities that are uncommon, concepts that are unknown or avocations that have not been done or tried before. Regardless of the nature of their interests, they often have a tendency to try to accumulate as much knowledge about the field as they can, and sometimes to improve the field by finding new ways of conceptually framing its basic principles (needs an example). Eventually, once there is nothing left to discover, or when they simply become bored, they will follow their curiosity and find a new topic of interest.Many IEEs require a certain degree of freedom from obligation in order to do their work and pursue their sometimes idiosyncratic interests, to the point where they may dramatically eschew conventional lifestyles. Some IEEs may have an irrational dread of working at a desk job or an office where they do not have the opportunity to pursue their whimsical hobbies. However, they often overestimate the torturous ordeal of having to perform specific chores that are not in line with their interests, and many IEEs that are acclimated to the reality of their obligations may not share this trepidation at having to fulfill them.IEEs are often spontaneous and sometimes quite distractible individuals whose natural energy level leads them to be working on something or doing something most of the time (in contrast to dominant types whose natural state is one of inertia and contemplation). However their work is often periodic in nature rather and tends to be on whatever projects they have involved themselves in at the moment, or whatever they are interested in doing at the moment, rather than a consistent schedule or routine. Many IEEs routinely have spur-of-the-moment ideas or curiosities, and may be inclined to look up random information or do arbitrary things that have occurred to them in lieu of whatever they might have been working on previously.IEEs, perhaps more than any other type, often have a tendency to seek out multiple perspectives and viewpoints on controversial matters. They are rarely tied down to any particular ideology and often have an implicit sense of faith that others are as intellectually open as they are. IEEs frequently have a innately optimistic disposition (despite how bleak they perceive the facts of any situation to be), and often earnestly believe in the value of a process of thorough, respectful, and politically correct discussion of controversial matters, and often that through a such due process of formal exposition of viewpoints, most reasonable people will come to a consensus as to the essential facts and truth of the debate.IEEs often tend to mentalize and verbalize matters of personal development, individual qualities, and significant personal experiences, and often develop connections best with others through disucssing matters of personal development that are close at heart to them. They may have a sort of innate tendency to spontaneously try to help others find an appropriate outlet for their particular talents, focusing on the potential positive aspects of their character; they may become engrossed over what people might become rather than what they are currently, and thus have a tendency to be able to see the positive side of everyone.Introverted Ethics (Fi, )At first glance, IEEs are usually friendly, propitious and accepting people. They often enjoy interacting and learning from all types of people and tend to enjoy cultivating a sincere atmosphere of passive good will, where others can feel comfortable and accepted for who they are.Like SEEs, IEEs are usually aware of and highly influenced by their emotional responses towards other people, things, or situations, but unlike SEEs they are less likely to be driven by their emotional reactions quite as viscerally; instead, their emotions are more likely to drive them to be a bit avoidant. They are often disturbed by conflict or aggression, and rather than espousing a confrontational or accusatory attitude, when possible they often prefer to politely smile and avoid being drawn into contentious arguments. They may be also somewhat fettered by and avoidant of situations replete with feelings of social awkwardness or situations in which their autonomy over their activities or choices is threatened.They may be inclined to keep track of a large network of social acquaintances with whom they feel a significant connection. Many IEEs share a common pattern in that for them mental stimulation is often interpersonal; they may extensively enjoy interacting with many different people and find a situation boring if there are no interesting people with whom to engage in conversation.Super-Ego BlockExtroverted Sens

Over President Donald Trump's first 100 days, we're asking him questions that our audience wants answers to. Join the project by tweeting this question to @realDonaldTrump with the hashtag #100Days100Qs.#43. @realDonaldTrump what is your administration's official stance on organized labor? #100Days100QsRight now, about 10 percent of American workers belong to an organized labor union, a number that has dropped significantly in recent decades — about 50 years ago, one-third of the US workforce belonged to a union.President Donald Trump has attacked unions before, and his initial pick to lead the Department of Labor — fast food executive Andy Puzder — was decried by union leaders. Puzder ultimately didn't get the job after he came under scrutiny for employing an undocumented worker, and for allegations that he abused his ex-wife.The president's new pick for to labor secretary — Alexander Acosta — has been well-received by some unions, though he has yet to go through a Senate confirmation hearing."Unlike Andy Puzder, Alexander Acosta's nomination deserves serious consideration," said Richard L. Trumka, president of the AFL-CIO trade union. "In one day, we've gone from a fast-food chain CEO who routinely violates labor law to a public servant with experience enforcing it."The issue of organized labor is top of mind for many, including Takeaway listener Joshua Barclay from New York City."President Trump, you talk a lot about trade agreements — NAFTA, TPP, and how they are incredibly harmful to the American worker, but what is your stance on organized labor in America?" Barclay asked us on Anchor in response to our 100 Days 100 Questions series. "It seems to me like the Republican Party has been enforcing an agenda that weakens the influence of organized labor in this country. So, my question is, like your Republican cohorts, do you plan on continuing to weaken the influence of labor, or are you going to introduce policies that strengthen the rights of American workers and strengthen labor unions, organized labor and things of that nature?"But it's not just everyday people that are concerned with the state of organized labor. Along with US Senator Bernie Sanders, activist and actor Danny Glover joined thousands of workers to march on Nissan's factory in Canton, Mississippi, over the weekend. The workers there are protesting alleged harassment and intimidation of the factory's predominantly black workforce, who have been denied the right to vote for a union.Nissan has union representation in 42 of its 45 plants around the world, but the Canton plant, which began operating in 2003, is not counted among them. In 2015, the National Labor Relations Board charged Nissan with violating worker rights with intimidation tactics designed to prevent workers from unionizing.Glover says the community had high hopes when the Canton plant was opened, but permanent employees have since been largely replaced by temporary workers whose voices aren't being heard."When they opened this plant about 14 years ago, they received about $1 billion in tax incentives from the state of Mississippi, and they hired permanent workers with decent wages," Glover says. "The workers have, for years, all they've demanded is the right to vote on whether they want a union or not. And the company has used every technique [to stop them] — from threatening to move the plant or closing the plant; threatening and intimidating workers; cutting their hours short. They've been cited by the National Labor Relations Board for those activities."According to Glover, 80 percent of the workers at Nissan's Canton factory are black or African American. Overall, black workers were more likely to belong to unions in 2016 than their white, Asian or Hispanic counterparts, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics."Black workers continued to have a higher union membership rate in 2016 (13.0 percent) than workers who were White (10.5 percent), Asian (9.0 percent), or Hispanic (8.8 percent)," the BLS reports.Glover argues that the workers in Canton need to be treated fairly and "have a voice at the table.""All the changes that have happened with respect to benefits, with respect to health care [and] with respect to safety are arbitrarily determined by the company itself, not with a discussion by the workers themselves," he says. "Nissan works with unions around the world. Why is it able to work with unions around the world and not with workers in Mississippi?"According to Glover, worker concerns about safety have gone ignored by the company, and some have been seriously injured or even died while on the job."There's a very, very bad safety record here at Nissan," he says. "Workers have complained that they're afraid to take any time off for anything — an illness or an issue they may have, a physical issue — because they're afraid they may lose their job or place
Steps on how to enable developer mode on your Xbox OneHow to sideload Retrix and use itThe Xbox One now has a port of LibRetro, called Retrix. Thanks to the hard work of @Absestos , they've ported some of the LibRetro cores to UWP, which both Windows 10 and Xbox One users can use. You can currently emulate games from a wide range of systems, like the NES, SNES, GBA, Sega Genesis, PlayStation 1, with even more additions planned in the future, like N64 and Dreamcast. Retrix also allows for 2 player support, as well as savestates. The project is still early in development, but has come a long way in a short amount of time.The caveat to being able to access this, is that users will need a Developer Account, for their Xbox One. The process is simple, but requires $19.99 to activate, permanently. You then receive 3 slots to register any accounts to. You can do that by followingI personally tried out the emulator myself, using the following games.Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island: Works fullspeed, but crashes at randomContra III: Runs well, but experiences slowdown during explosionsSecret of Mana: Works fullspeedSuper Mario World: Works fullspeedAll GameBoy and GameBoy Color games crashed the program.Sonic Advance 3: Runs fullspeed.Pokemon Fire Red: Does not boot.Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow: Runs fullspeed.Fire Emblem: Sacred Stones: Runs fullspeed.All attempted titles besides Sonic Chaos resulted in a black screen.Sonic 3: Runs fine except when you lose rings, which causes slowdownRoad Rash: Runs fine until you get hit, and the game has a runtime errorSonic CD: Works fullspeedShining Force CD: Works fullspeed1. Obtain a developer account.2. On your Xbox One, install the free "Dev Mode Activation" app from the Xbox store3. The Xbox will then give you a 6 digit code, on your computer, go to theand put the code in there.4. Your system will confirm the activation code, and prompt you to restart into Developer Mode1. After the above steps, the console will be in Developer Mode. You will then see your Xbox One's IP on the home menu.2. Type this IP into your browser, which will take you a hub page. You can upload the .APPX for Retrix here. It'll install to your Xbox, and you'll be good to go.3. PlayStation and Sega CD games require BIOS. You'll need these to play games from either of those systems.4. Get a USB with a roms folder on root, put any roms and BIOS files there.5. You're done! Select a given system from Retrix's menu, and load your rom, and it will boot.
Share. So there you go. So there you go.Before PlayStation 4's official reveal, rumors were swirling that the console would come packing some sort of used games block, disabling a gamer's ability to play pre-owned or shared titles. But Shuhei Yoshida, Sony's head of its first-party Worldwide Studios, has confirmed to Eurogamer that that's simply not the case.Exit Theatre ModeIn a rather strange conversation between Eurogamer's writer and Yoshida, a back and forth ended up resulting in the following declaration from the Sony executive: "So, used games can play on PS4. How is that?" The answer came following an exchange between Yoshida and a Sony Japan PR representative, apparently seeking clarification about the particular question being asked.We've reached out to Sony for official clarification, but considering that this comes from a well-established Sony executive in the know, it's safe to assume that PlayStation 4 will indeed be able to play used games.

A total of 50 of Scotland's 59 seats have changed hands in an unprecedented shift to the SNP at the polls.The party now has 56 MPs while Labour and the Lib Dems have seen their standing slashed to one seat each. The Conservatives retain their single seat.How Scotland votedIn 2010, Labour had 41 seats, the Lib Dems 11, SNP 6 and the Conservatives just one. Nicola Sturgeon's party has dramatically overturned those figures, taking 40 from Labour and 10 from the Lib Dems.Labour now holds just Edinburgh South and the Liberal Democrats retain only Orkney & Shetland. The Conservatives keep Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale & Tweeddale.Parties through timeA change of this magnitude has not been previously seen in Scotland in a single election.The Conservatives went from being the largest party (by one seat) in 1955 to being electorally wiped out in 1997 but that decline took decades.Big names voted outSenior figures to lose their seats to the SNP include Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy and Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander.Danny Alexander, Liberal Democrat, Chief Secretary to the Treasury.

Heavy periods are common, but they can have a big effect on a woman's everyday life. They don't always have an underlying cause, but they can result from problems such as fibroids or endometriosis, so it's important to get your symptoms checked out. See your GP if: you're worried about your bleedingyour periods have got heavieryou're also having other symptoms, such as period pain or bleeding between your periods Various treatments are available for heavy periods, including: some types of contraception, like an intrauterine system (IUS) or the combined pillmedicines, like tranexamic acidsurgeryHow much is heavy bleeding? It's difficult to define exactly what a heavy period is because it varies from woman to woman. Heavy for one woman may be normal for another. Most women will lose less than 16 teaspoons of blood (80ml) during their period, with the average being around 6 to 8 teaspoons. Heavy menstrual bleeding is defined as losing 80ml or more in each period, having periods that last longer than 7 days, or both. However, it's not usually necessary to measure blood loss. Most women have a good idea of how much bleeding is normal for them during their period and can tell when this changes. A good indication that your periods are heavy is if you: are having to change your sanitary products every hour or twoare passing blood clots larger than 2.5cm (about the size of a 10p coin)are bleeding through to your clothes or beddingneed to use two types of sanitary product together – for example, tampons and padsSeeing a GP and further tests Your GP will start by asking you about your heavy bleeding, any changes to your periods and any other symptoms you have, like bleeding between your periods or period pain. All women who have heavy periods should be offered a blood test to check for iron deficiency anaemia. The GP may also suggest a physical examination or refer you for further tests to try to find out if there's an underlying cause for your heavy periods. Further tests may include: other blood testsan ultrasound scana hysteroscopy – where a narrow telescope with a light and camera at the end is passed into the womb through the vagina to examine the inside of the womb Read more about diagnosing heavy periods.

Use this list to keep track of all your third-trimester tasks, from doing kick counts to making a birth plan and deciding on a baby name.Activities for your third trimesterKeep track of your baby's movementsPay attention to your baby's kicks, twitches, and rolls and let your doctor or midwife know right away if you notice a decrease in movement. Less movement may signal a problem, and you'll need testing to check on your baby's condition. Your healthcare provider may recommend that you spend some time each day counting your baby's kicks – find out how to do "kick counts."Learn about third-trimester prenatal visits and testsYou'll most likely have a checkup every two weeks from 28 to 36 weeks, then switch to once-a-week visits until you deliver. As you and your provider get to know each other better and as your due date draws near, you can expect a mix of regular physical exams, late-pregnancy tests, and discussions about the coming birth.Find out more about third-trimester prenatal visits.Consider more classesIn addition to a childbirth class, you may want to consider classes on baby care, breastfeeding, and infant CPR. Many hospitals offer these, and you can also ask your provider or childbirth education teacher for a recommendation.Prepare for breastfeedingIf you're planning to breastfeed your baby, learn as much as you can about it now. Talk to nursing moms, read articles to familiarize yourself, and consider calling your local La Leche League International chapter or taking a breastfeeding class. The more you know about how to get started and the benefits of nursing, the better.Choose a doctor for your babyGet names of pediatricians or family practitioners from friends, co-workers, neighbors, or your prenatal caregiver. Make sure the doctor accepts your health insurance, keeps hours that work with your schedule, and has an office that's convenient for you.If you can, schedule face-to-face interviews with your top candidates. If it seems too early to be thinking about this, keep in mind that your baby will have his or her first doctor's visit shortly after birth.Learn more about choosing a doctor for your baby.Think about big decisionsWould you like to stay home with your baby full- or part-time? If you're having a boy, would you like him to be circumcised? Will you have a religious ceremony after your baby's born? What about banking your baby's cord blood? These are some of the big decisions to think and talk about now.Assemble your baby gearThis is the perfect job for your partner or a friend who wants to help. Cribs, bassinets, and strollers can be tricky to put together, especially when you're sleep-deprived, so get started now. Swings, mobiles, and monitors usually require batteries, so make sure you have enough on hand. To save money – and help the planet – consider getting rechargeable batteries and a battery charger.Set up a safe place for your baby to sleepWhether you plan to have your baby slumber in a crib or bassinet, it's important to follow basic guidelines to reduce your baby's risk of SIDS.Find out all about making sure your baby's sleeping space is safe.Talk to your babyYour baby can hear your voice now, and talking to him or her is a great way to start the bonding process. If having an actual conversation with your bump seems odd, try narrating your daily activities; reading a book, magazine, or newspaper aloud; or sharing your secret wishes for your child.This is great practice for after your baby's born, too. Talking to babies is one of the best ways to help them develop language skills.Learn about coping with labor painThere's no one right way to deliver a baby: Every woman's experience with pain is different and every labor is different. But whether you know you want pain medication during childbirth or a natural birth, it's good to learn about your options now.Know the stages of laborFor first-time moms, labor takes an average of 15 hours, though it's not uncommon to last more than 20. (For women who've previously had a vaginal birth, it averages eight hours.) The process is divided into three main stages – learn about them so you'll feel prepared for labor and birth.Create a birth planChildbirth is unpredictable, and chances are you won't follow your birth plan to the letter. Still, it's helpful to figure out your preferences beforehand for pain management techniques, who'll be present during delivery, whether your baby will "room in" with you after birth, and more.Fill out our handy Birth Plan Worksheet and discuss it with your provider.
Continuing to showcase various football shirts in a lifestyle setting, Christian Gideon's 'Untitled Kit Project' moves into the next chapter, touching down with Columbus Crew the club in question.Black and yellow and good to go, the kit is almost secondary to the situation. It's a chance for fans to show their colours and embrace their support and there's few ways that stand the test of time in the shape of aesthetic fandom as the football shirt. This number, like all from the MLS, is made by adidas though it stands out in its own right. A unique colour scheme and badge symbolic of adventurous cool, it's got it all.Undergoing a re-brand in 2014, this is a club that sets a strong creative bar internally with their output on point. The badge, to the kit and a club in a positive trajectory, this series of images pays tribute to football and it's creative game.You can see more from the project and indeed Christian's work, here.
Weekly Journal - Remember NovemberHey everyone,We can't believe we're already in November! Wait, who are we kidding?! It's Montreal, and already freezing cold, so we have plenty of reminders of where we are in the season! Before we know it, it will be Spring, and--after 4 years of hard work--we'll be presenting our game to the world. This is both scary and exciting!We received a lot of pictures from your We Happy Few Halloween costumes and thought they were all wonderful. Thank you for taking the time to make, wear, and share them! It warmed our twisted little hearts.ProductionSamAfter lots of hard work from the team, we're pretty much where we wanted to be with "content complete!". For us, this doesn't mean that content is done - it's not - but it does mean that we have every quest in the game, with its objectives, journals and VO. That's an exciting milestone, because we can now review the entire game, and entire story, to make sure that it works. That work begins next week, along with localization, more finaling, responding to UX tests, bug fixing, and all the final tasks that we have on the project. The team has worked really hard to get here, and it's really shaping up to be a lot of fun.Design Team - David, Hayden, Antoine, Adam, Ben, Eric, Roxanne And BenjiAdamHoly Hell has this been a productive week. I've been working with Cary and Remi to blow stuff up. Big stuff. BIG boom... And you're going to love it when you see it. That aside, as most of you know, I'm in charge of the Mad Scotsman in its entirety. I finished up plugging in all the dialogue last week, and this week I've been focusing on realization (making shit believable), and blockers (bugs which halt your progression). I have to say, I'm super proud of the Mad Scotsman's playthrough… and I also find myself adopting a scottish accent from time to time. Gonnae git back tae it, ya weapons!RoxanneLots of dialogue integration on my side this week. I also found some time to add five new "non-lethal" weapons, for those of you that want to avoid unnecessary deaths.EricWell, Alex wrote a mountain of dialogue for Arthur, and we got most of it into the build this week. Thanks to Hayden, Benji, Ben, and Roxanne for helping me put in something like a thousand different Arthur lines across 30+ quests. Take that Alex!Narrative Team - Alex And LisaLisaI'm...done? We've locked content for 1.0, so mostly what I'm doing for the game now is just dealing with missing bits and bobs, and making suggestions for polish. Happily, I am also writing the How To Be Happy book that will be in the time capsule, so I still get to live in the joyful world of Wellington Wells a while longer!Animation Team - JR, Rémi, Vincent, Mike P, Jules, Raph And FranziJulesHey, everybody! So this week I've worked mostly on the doctor! Especially on his resurrect and healing ability. And also I've made a new hit reaction for the player when he carries the bone saw.Somewhat Dangerous MikeHey guys! So this week I worked on some more cutscenes like last week for something again I can't tell you about. But I REALLY REALLY want to though! Cause it's great! But alas I can't. Guess you'll just have to play the game to find out. I'm on to something far more exciting now though. I know I know, you're saying to yourself: "Self, this seems impossible, with all the awesome." And you'd be right. But really though it's not impossible! At least not for me. It's super exciting. But again it's all hush hush. So that's it for me this week, so tune in next week, same Bat time, same Bat channel!TL;DR: Super Awesome & Hush hush.Engineering Team - Matt, Serge, Michael, Lionel, Rob, Evan, Maarten, Céline, Neil And Guillaume (Sometimes)CélineI've been working on the skills and skill menu with Evan, and we have a first working version! The team is also looking for the best skills that will improve and level the game experience. Additionally, they will be used to highlight some unclear gameplay features which are already implemented. It is progressing quite well and I hope you guys will like that new addition.MichaelThis week I've been taking a look at the conformity

WHAT IS KRATOMA botanical cousin of the common coffee bush with hundreds of years of indigenous use as natural medicine that not only has immunostimulant properties but in addition to being a possible mood booster, antidepressant and effective analgesi has more antioxidant power than a cup of green tea. It's the mitragyna speciosa, a bush indigenous to the jungles of Southeast Asia where it's known as kratom, ketum, ithang or some other name depending on the region. Kratom has hundreds (if not thousands) of years of safe and effective human use in the region where it's found and over a century of research, including an isolate of the plant being synthesized as early as 1921.Kratom has been researched globally and to a great degree. A US patent was granted June of 2013 for a number of "Hybrid opioid compounds and compositions and their pharmaceutical compositions, as well as to methods of treating pain in humans using the hybrid compounds and mixed opioid salts." Both mitragynine and the derivative mitragynine-pseudoindoxyl are referenced in the patent multiple times. This and multiple works of scholarship in regards to the use of kratom and it's chemical makeup and physiological effects go as far back as to 1836.Recent interest in kratom as a means of chronic pain management, alternative energy source and general health tonic and panacea led to Forbes picking up the story. David DiSalvo of Forbes' continued the story as "The Kratom Experiment Begins" in February of 2013. The "experiment" (which was covered at his "Daily Brain" section at his private blog) was evidently a success: "Initially it provides a burst of energy very similar to a strong cup of coffee. Unlike coffee, however, the energy I derived from Kratom was longer-lasting and level. My experience with coffee is that the initial burst is strong but it tapers and descends rapidly, leading to the well-known caffeine crash. The energy from Kratom, on the other hand, would often last for three or four hours, but was subtle enough that at no point did I feel like I was jumping out of my skin. I also did not experience an energy crash with any of the Kratom products I sampled."Lloyd Billingsley, policy fellow at the Independent Institute in Oakland, Californiais also a believer. He writes in the Washington Times: "Scientific research should continue. Federal and state officials need to be open-minded, see where the scientific research leads, and consider all the evidence. […] Banning kratom or banning its ingredients, as Indiana has done, is the wrong message at the wrong time."As we've shown, there is quite a bit of human history and much of that has been legitimate research that has been carried out since the resurgence of interest in Mitragyna speciosa korthals by Dr. E.J. Shellard in the 70's and on.DEPRESSION & ANXIETYA 2011 study in the journal "Phytomedicine" reports that mitragynine "significantly reduced the released of corticosterone in mice […]. Overall, the present study clearly demonstrated that mitragynine exerts an antidepressant effect in animal behavioral model of depression" and did so " without any significant effect on locomotor activity." In other words, the rats were not incapacitated physically or cognitively. Considering the fact that kratom contains constituents that can relieve anxiety, block adrenergic receptors, the same ones responsible for the surge of neurotoxic corticosterones released during the "fight or flight" syndrome, the compounding health benefit to someone who experiences deleterious physiological as well as mental symptoms of depression and anxiety.CHRONIC PAIN and ADDICTIONAccording to the article " Behavioral and neurochemical characterization of kratom (Mitragyna speciosa) extract" by Stolt, Schroeder, et al. kratom "contains several alkaloids and is used in traditional medicine to alleviate musculoskeletal pain, hypertension, coughing, diarrhea, and as an opiate substitute for addicts."Researchers Boyer, McCurdy and Adkins published their patent on kratom as an alternative opioid withdrawal means. Despite being shown to be helpful in treating mild, moderate or severe pain and mitigating opiate dependance and withdrawal symptoms, it's own "abstinence syndrome" is considered no worse than that of caffeine withdrawal with similar symptoms (mild headache, lethargy, etc.). For the same reason it's being looked into for it's mood lifting properties (owing to it's action on the dopaminergic and serotonergic system) the scientists feel that "may also be useful for the treatment of other addictive drugs besides opiate derivatives."Unlike traditional opiate and opioid medications addiction potential and also danger of overdose due to respiratory depression are a factor, along with lowered price

Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders took some heat from CNN's Jake Tapper during an April 3 interview. The topic: The degree of public transparency Sanders has provided for his tax returns.Tapper brought up the topic: "I'm kind of surprised that you haven't gone further on transparency. You released the summary page of your 2014 tax returns. Hillary Clinton has posted on her website the last eight years of her personal returns, all of the returns. Before the New York primary, will you match her? Will you post your full returns for the last eight years?"Sanders responded, "You know who does our tax returns? My wife does our tax returns. We've been a little bit busy lately. So we will get out as much information as we can. There ain't going to be very much exciting in that. I get a salary from the United States Senate, you know, there's not going to be anything new in it that people haven't seen for the last many years, but we will get it out as soon as we can."Tapper wasn't satisfied. "But nobody has seen them at all, I guess, is the point, and whether or not there's anything exciting in them...."At this point, Sanders interjected, "No, that is not true. That is not true. Of course, we have released them in the past. Our financial situation, to the best of my knowledge, has not changed very much, but we will get out all of that information as soon as we can."How transparent has Sanders been with his tax past returns? Not very, compared with others in the 2016 presidential field. Here's a closer look.As our friends at the Washington Post Fact Checker have noted, Tax Analysts, a publisher specializing in tax policy, has been collecting publicly available tax returns of presidential candidates and other top officials for its Tax History Project. This archive goes back as far as the 1913 tax returns of future president Franklin D. Roosevelt.Here's a look at what their current archive of the 2016 candidates looks like:In other words, among the candidates still in the race, Sanders' releases are less extensive than anybody's but Donald Trump. (Trump, too, has faced criticism for refusing to share his returns.)And Sanders' shortcomings are actually bigger than the screenshot above would suggest. The 2014 filings Sanders released consist of just the first two summary pages of his Form 1040 and the equivalent summary pages from his home-state Vermont tax form.Why does this matter? Unlike most of the other candidates, Sanders has not released the succeeding pages -- the nitty gritty detail of things like charitable donations and other types of itemized deductions. For instance, Clinton's release for tax year 2014 is 44 pages long, or more than 10 times the length of Sanders' for the same year.It's worth noting that Sanders, as a member of Congress, files annual financial disclosures, which are accessible online back to 2012. And as a presidential candidate, he also files financial disclosure documents to the Federal Election Commission.But tax returns are much more detailed. And despite what Sanders said in the exchange with Tapper, his campaign did not provide PolitiFact with any earlier, publicly available tax forms. The campaign told the Post that it has not released any other tax returns prior to 2014. (The campaign did tell PolitiFact that they would release his 2015 returns once they are filed.)Tax and disclosure experts we contacted agreed that Sanders' current disclosures are weak by historical standards."If I filed the first two pages of my return with the IRS, it would not take long for them to ding me," said Kenneth A. Gross of the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP and a specialist in political disclosure and ethics. "There is a lot of information on the pages following the cover pages."Joseph J. Thorndike, the Tax Analysts official who heads the Tax History Project, agreed.Sanders "has not, in fact, released his most recent tax return," Thorndike said. "He has released a portion of that return. The IRS would not accept a Form 1040 as a complete return and neither should voters. Also, it's worth noting that Sanders has not released any portion of his older returns. … If Mitt Romney had tried to release an incomplete return in 2012, the media would never have accepted it."Our rulingSanders told Tapper that his campaign has released his past tax returns.Sanders said his 2015 return is forthcoming, and he has made other types of disclosures in the past, including congressional and presidential-candidate filings. But his releases of prior-year tax forms -- the specific documents Tapper asked about -- have been limited in several ways. He's only released information for one year, which pales compared to most other recent presidential candidates, and even that year's release
Table of ContentsDefinition The Subway diet is the weight-loss plan created by Jared Fogle, an obese college student who weighed 425 pounds (192.7 kilograms). The 22-year-old Fogle lost 245 pounds (111.1 kilograms) in 11 months by following a daily diet that consisted primarily of two low-fat sandwiches purchased at the Subway fast-food chain. After losing 100 pounds (45.4 kilograms), the 6-foot-2 (187.9-centimter) Fogle added walking to his daily routine. His dramatic weight loss led to Fogle's appearances in Subway commercials and his role as a motivational speaker and an advocate in the fight against childhood obesity.Origins Jared's Fogle's unique diet led to his weight loss and international fame as the star of Subway sandwich commercials. He created the Subway diet in March of 1998.By1999,heweighed 180 pounds (81.6 kilograms). In 2000, he began appearing in Subway TV commercials. His weight loss was illustrated by the image of the slender Fogle holding his pre-diet jeans with the 60-inch (152.4-centimeter) waist. At that time, Fogle weighed 190 pounds (86.1 kilograms). He had maintained that weight as of the spring of 2007 and wore pants with a 34-inch (86.4-centimeter) waist. The public identified Fogle by his first name or as the "Subway Guy." The Subway diet was one component of Fogle's fame; the public also celebrated his weight loss and his campaign to educate others about the importance of diet and exercise. Fogle drew upon his life experiences when speaking about those issues to the media, on talk shows, and in presentations to schools and other groups.Progressive weight gain Physically, Fogle's ankles and wrists had swelled with edema. His blood pressure was high, and his sleep was interrupted by apnea. Overweight people are at risk of sleep apnea, a condition where blockage causes the person to repeatedly stop breathing. Fogle realized it was time to start dieting, and he described those efforts in his 2006 book, Jared, the Subway Guy: Winning Through Losing: 13 Lessons for Turning Your Life Around.Deciding to diet Fogle decided to lose weight during his junior year of college. He had moved out of the dorm and into an apartment located next to a Subway shop. While the shop was close to home, Fogle tried three other diets before creating the Subway diet. His first diet limited calories to 1,800 per day and involved extensive food preparation. The preparation was time-consuming, and he ended the diet. Next Fogle went to the store and stocked up on low-calorie and diet frozen meals. He disliked the taste of the microwaved meals and embarked on another diet. This one involved drinking diet shakes for breakfast and lunch and eating a sensible meal for dinner. Fogle thought the shakes tasted terrible. He abandoned that diet but was determined to lose weight. He researched and rejected what he called "one-size-fits-all" diets. As spring break approached, Fogle found inspiration in Subway's "Seven Under 6 Grams of Fat" menu, a selection of seven low-fat sandwiches. In March of 1998, Fogle developed a weight loss plan that consisting basically of eating two sandwiches each day. Once he shed 100 pounds (45.4 kilograms) on his customized diet, Fogle started walking to school. He eventually established a routine of walking 1.5 miles (2.4 kilometers) each day. By the following spring, Fogle had shed more than half of his original weight. Fame came when he encountered Ryan Coleman, a college friend who hadn't seen him in some time. Coleman was astounded about Fogle's weight loss and wrote about it for the college newspaper in April of 1999. Organizations including the Associated Press ran the story, and Men's Health magazine included Fogle's story under the heading "Crazy Diets That Work." That led to a Subway menu items with 6 grams of fat or less Menu item Serving (g) Calories Fat (g) Cholesterol (mg) Sodium (mg) Carbohydrates (g) Protein (g) Dietary fiber (g) Veggie Delite® Wrap 159 210 5.0 0 610 37 7 3 Salads Ham 378 120 3.0 20 840 14 12 4 Oven roasted chicken 392 140 2.5 50 400 11 19 4 Roast beef 378 1220 3.0 15 480 12 13 4 Subway Club® 411 150 4.0 35 840 14 18 4 Turkey breast 378 110 2.5 20 580 13 12 4 Turkey breast and ham 388 120 3.0 25 790 14 14 4 Veggie Delite® 322 60 1.0 0 75 11 3 4 Sandwiches Ham, 6" 223 290 5.0 20 1,260 47 18 4 Chicken breast, oven roasted, 6" 237 310 5.0 25 830 48

Gavin Eugene Long, the gunman who killed three police officers and wounded three others in Baton Rouge, La., on Sunday, left a vast and angry online trail documenting his interest in black separatism and fury at police shootings of black men.Long, whose identity was confirmed by a law enforcement official, was shot to death by police after opening fire on officers on Airline Highway, less than a mile from the city's police headquarters in Baton Rouge.One law enforcement official described him as "a black separatist." He carried out the shooting on his 29th birthday, and was from Kansas City, Mo.It's unclear when he came to Baton Rouge.Long went by "Cosmo" online and had registered the domain name ConvosWithCosmo.club in April using his Kansas City address. The website shows a generic page with ads but a similarly named site, ConvosWithCosmo.com, includes links to podcasts, YouTube videos, books of his for sale and various social media accounts.In a video posted on social media, Gavin Long, the man identified by a U.S. government official as the Baton Rouge police shooting suspect, urges fighting back against oppressors. In a video posted on social media, Gavin Long, the man identified by a U.S. government official as the Baton Rouge police shooting suspect, urges fighting back against oppressors.Throughout his postings, Long described violence as the solution to what he saw as oppression of black Americans. He railed against the July 5 police shooting of 37-year-old Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge."One hundred percent of revolutions, of victims fighting their oppressors, from victims fighting their bullies, 100% have been successful through fighting back through bloodshed," he said in a video. "Zero have been successful through simply protesting. It has never been successful and it never will."In a tweet, he called violence an "answer.""At what point do you stand up so that your people don't become the Native Americans … EXTINCT?" it said. In another tweet, he praised Micah Johnson, the man who shot and killed five police officers in Dallas, saying "he was one of us!" and "my religion is justice."In a July 8 video, Long suggested that if "anything happens to me … don't affiliate me with anybody." In a tweet with a video, which he said was filmed with a body camera in Dallas on July 10, Long shouted at black men getting haircuts at a barber shop: "Everyone in this room got a purpose, just figure it out!"He also wrote about his experiences as a U.S. Marine."While stationed in San Diego, California, Cosmo became a highly esteemed and sought after nutritionist and personal trainer," Long wrote on his website.According to military records, Long served for five years, including deployments to Iraq for seven months in 2008 and 2009 and a post in Okinawa, Japan. Much of his time was spent in California. He worked as a data network specialist.Reports say he was honorably discharged in 2010.After leaving the military, he received an associate's degree in General Studies at Central Texas College and studied for three semesters at Clark Atlanta University, according to his online postings.Long dropped out after having a "spiritual revelation," gave away "all of his material possessions" and traveled to Africa, he wrote. The website says he crisscrossed Rwanda, Ethiopia, Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, Egypt, Ghana and Burkina Faso, and wrote three books, including a two-part series called a "A (W)holistic Guide for the Total Transformation of Melanated People."Long's attendance at those universities could not be confirmed, but a spokesman for the University of Alabama said that a student with Long's name took classes there in 2012. He made the dean's list that spring.Besides posting on his own sites, Long appears to have contributed frequently to other forums. On one website, a user named Cosmo Setepenra with an email address associated with Long complained about government surveillance. On stoporgangstalking.com, a user named Cosmo commented about the importance of wearing body cameras and exposing people involved in "gang stalking."Long also appeared to follow at least one online radio show hosted by Lance Scurv, who said he featured a Cosmo Setenepra on his radio show this year in a long conversation about nutrition and health. They stayed in touch, talking on the phone every now and then. Scurv, who is based in Orlando, Fla., said Cosmo spoke from a phone number with a Kansas City area code."He seemed to be like a guy in transition," he said. "But he never expressed rage like there was something brewing."On July 9, Scurv posted an email that Cosmo asked
That's certainly a possibility. Most of the slab is clearly runes. About half were ones I was pretty confident on before consulting anything.But working through I noticed that some appeared to be backwards or inverted. But then I decided to check different eras for the runes and found a few matches I didn't expect. Even still, there's several that look like they "fit" in regards to style etc. but no one has any matches.Which does open up the possibility that more than one region's "alphabet" is in play at the same time.I should clarify a thought I kinda failed to expand on in my first post. I decided to attempt to translate as there's a few instances of repeat runes. The idea being that if they were intended to convey the more symbolic meanings (ice, elk, etc.) then I'd expect symbols not to repeat. Sort of like the runes are carved as blessing. The blessing of isaz or ice would only be transcribed once for instance.I have two alternative theories that could help this make sense:It could be a recorded history, in which the runes at the beginning are "older" than the last line. This would explain the changing style. It might not even be a history lesson, but as the slab is passed down, a new "blessing" or rune is added. In the latter case, a coherent message would be unlikely.Alternatively, it could be sort of like a picture story. Each rune represents the symbolic meaning and is intended to convey a story. So like the first line might have something to do with an ice elkFrom what I have, that would be:Yew Tree*, wealth/cattle, elk, ???, joy, need**???, Sun**, ???, ulcer/torch, Sun, Ice, Need, SunIce, wealth/cattle, year/good year (harvest), man, Tiwaz (a god generally better knows as "Tyr"), Ice*From quick research Yggdrasill might have been a yew tree. Seems interesting to say the least. However, this rune would need another line at the top (heading down and right) to be that rune for sure. It looks incomplete, but with the lower line the "waz" rune looked closest and it's hard to tell if that top line might have been started. Otherwise, "ice" might be reasonable as well.**This one also looks to be possibly incomplete or defaced, so "need" is the best guess I have***This rune could be a separate one or part of the first one on the second lineAssuming I have any of this right, it's interesting thematically. We could have a beginning of "tree," some references to nature, joy and need (driving forces/motivations). This is followed by what could be cyclic use of the word "sun" which as we all should know makes some sense. And it ends some repetition of ice, possible images of bounty (wealth/cattle and good year/harvest) followed by the rune for man, a god known for bravery and wisdom and ending with ice.EDIT: The "elk" rune later turned into the one for man (and changed letters). It is also associated with life.EDIT EDIT: The second rune top line might not be "fehu" or "wealth/cattle." It could also be "berkanan" which means "birch" or other tree associations. So potentially two tree references top line
AMD formally announced its new Naples server CPU today, with up to 32 cores, eight memory channels, and its new, 128-lane Infinity Fabric. Ryzen's consumer performance may be impressive, but this is a straight server play, with AMD hoping to capitalize on strong performance in the 1-2 socket market.The company's strategy is similar to the one it adopted eleven years ago. Back in 2006, AMD's server business was one of the company's biggest success stories. Beginning in 2001, with the launch of Athlon MP and the 760MP chipset, AMD had slowly taken market share aware from Intel, particularly once Opteron launched. Its share of the worldwide server business peaked in Q2 2006, at just under 25% of the market. Today, AMD has less than 1% of the market, which is one of the reasons it's so eager to rejoin that particular fight. Intel's data center business was worth $17.2 billion in 2016, up 8% from 2015. If AMD can capture 5% of that business, that's $860 million of additional revenue per year, and it's revenue that comes with a nice margin.AMD's Naples (that's the design name, not the marketing brand) server CPU is a multi-chip-module design rather than a unified 32-core chip. This makes smart sense for a number of reasons. First, GlobalFoundries has no experience building a 32-core processor on 14nm, and the sheer size of the die would be a bunker-buster. Instead, AMD has glued together multiple four-core CCXs into at least two multi-chip-modules (MCMs). Each MCM has four memory controllers and there are two groups of four in a 32-core chip, which is how AMD hits its 8-channel memory target. Total memory bandwidth per CPU is 170 GB/s.At its Ryzen tech day, AMD showed demos of its Naples CPU platform performing a sparse matrix calculation on a 3D data set. When both AMD and Intel chips were held to the same configuration — 44 cores, DDR4-1866 — the Intel CPU took 35 seconds to complete a workload where Naples took 18 seconds. When given its head and allowed to run all 64 cores and DDR4-2400, AMD cut another four seconds off its time. That's fairly significant performance, though we have to note that AMD released no details on how its Naples CPU was clocked, what clock speeds the chip will target, or even how the two servers were specifically configured. All such benchmark results should therefore be taken with a grain of salt.Then again, after seeing Ryzen's performance in desktop applications, the idea that it could serve up substantially better performance in memory bandwidth-bound applications isn't surprising. Any test that can leverage memory bandwidth is going to love Naples' 170GB/s of connectivity.Why AMD is focusing on the server marketIt may seem odd for AMD to prioritize breaking into servers over mobile, given that the mobile market's revenue is much larger than the data center space, but there are some specific reasons for AMD to target this market.First, Ryzen / Zen is unabashedly a server and workstation CPU. All of our benchmarks show that Ryzen is most competitive in computational workloads, particularly rendering tests. AMD is working on a mobile Ryzen, to be fielded with Raven Ridge later this year, but we still don't know much about the GPU solution that chip will use or what configurations AMD will offer. Bringing up the CPU and GPU together on 14nm is more complex than launching a CPU on 14nm, so it makes sense for AMD to target the easier lift.Second, the data center market is the only PC space that's really expected to grow in the next few years. Consumer PC sales have fallen every year since 2011. The best forecasts for this year are either flat or predict a smaller decrease than previously. AMD is going to enter the mobile market with Ryzen, but it doesn't make sense to prioritize launches in a contracting business.Third, AMD has an opportunity to shine with Naples that it may lack in mobile. It is unlikely, for example, that any mobile APU will offer the same advantages in core count and memory bandwidth the server part can achieve.Since Ryzen launched, AMD has occupied far more spots on Amazon's Top 20 CPU sales, and while this doesn't tell us anything about sales volume or revenue, seeing AMD nearly double its representation on that list is still a sign that Ryzen is in strong demand. (As of this writing, the Ryzen 7 1700 is in sixth place, the 1800X is in 8th, and Ryzen 7 1700 is in 12th place. The other spots are occupied by Piledriver and a lone APU SKU).Naples is unlikely to move in these kinds of volumes. But if server manufacturers pick up the chip the way consumers have, AMD could enjoy significantly improved financials by the end of the year.
NewsDomestic violence has come under the spotlight in Romania after a singer said her boyfriend-manager beat her up in a dispute over money.Marian ChiriacBucharestAlexandra Stan on Wednesday filed a complaint and took her manager and boyfriend, Marcel Prodan, to court for blackmail.In her complaint, Stan, 24, said he beat her up last week to force her to abandon her demand to receive money from her shows.On Saturday, police picked her up from a roadside, and took her to the hospital with clear signs of violence on her face.While many people were shocked, some were more skeptical, wondering whether it could be a publicity stunt.Either way, analysts say the incident highlighs the problem of domestic violence in a country as socially conservative as Romania."For most Romanians domestic violence is commonplace. Polls say around 60 per cent of people accept that a man 'may have reasons' for beating up his wife or children, which is too much," journalist Ramona Ursu said.Police statistics show that 4,800 domestic violence cases were registered in 2010, as well as 99 fatalities. But the real number of such cases is believed to be much bigger.In the country of 19.5 million people, many cases of domestic violence cases go unreported due to feelings of shame and because victims are frightened of their attackers.The government has failed to provide women with appropriate legal and institutional tools to fight back against such abuse, experts say.Police generally do not intervene in domestic disputes, for example, and tend to investigate only if the victim files a complaint. The criminal code also does not allow restraining orders to be issued.
All but 2 per cent of the heavy White Pages phone books that used to be delivered around Melbourne and Sydney went straight to the recycling bin, it has been revealed.Distribution of the phone book plummeted 98 per cent after Telstra subsidiary Sensis started testing an opt-in system in the two cities in 2011. Just 26,000 copies were requested each year in Melbourne and 20,000 in Sydney, a spokesman confirmed.Sensis plans to keep the opt-in program and has extended it to other capital cities, including Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide."There is currently no view to roll this out to regional or Hobart markets," a spokesman said.The Telstra directory business used to deliver about 1.5 million White Pages to both Melbourne and Sydney, which each have populations of more than 4 million. It still delivers that many copies of the White Pages business and government directory – unless a household opt out – and the Yellow Pages.Revelations that so few copies were requested shows how low demand really was for the printed phone directory.

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un called Saturday for government officials to eliminate any remaining "non-socialist" parts of society, showing him tightening his grip on the oppressive nation as he combats sanctions and ever-rising tensions with the United States and other adversaries.Speaking to a group of chairpersons for the country's ruling Workers' Party, Kim said all party members should join the "revolutionary offensive to uproot non-socialist practices" and educate working people to become "revolutionaries" who will defend North Korean culture from outside influence."When our socialist culture and art prevails over the corrupt bourgeois reactionary culture, it is possible for people not to harbor illusions about the enemies' culture but to prevent ideological and cultural poisoning by the imperialists," Kim said, according to the state-run KCNA news agency.Trending: What Supermarkets And Stores Are Open On Christmas Day 2017? CVS, Walgreens And MoreKim Jong Un missile launch MoreSTR/AFP/Getty ImagesKim said that although the party faced "manifold difficulties and hardships in the ways ahead," the party should feel confident in its control of citizens, and he said there would be "more new projects for the people" in the future, though he did not give details.The speech is the latest proof, if any was needed, that the young leader has no plans to bring the reforms that people in the isolated, totalitarian nation had hoped for when he came to power six years ago. Kim has given no hint that he plans to expand human rights or protections in his country, even as it faces unprecedented global scrutiny. Even though North Korea holds elections, the Workers' Party controls all aspects of political life there, while fair elections, free speech, and consuming media from other countries are not allowed.Don't miss: Secret Service Runs First Live White House Drill, Cites Fear of a 'Complex' Suicide AttackBut the address also showed Kim cracking the whip on his country as it confronts the latest international pressures over its spike in weapons testing.The United Nations Security Council last week unanimously adopted sanctions drafted by the U.S. that drastically cut exports to North Korea of gasoline, diesel, industrial materials and machinery, and also tell all countries using North Korean laborer to send them home within 24 months.The sanctions came as a response to North Korea's latest missile test in late November, and its continuing threats to attack the United States, where President Donald Trump keeps countering Kim's hints of impending warfare. Kim said Sunday that he views the sanctions as an "act of war" and expected the U.S. and other supporting nations to pay a price for the punishment. Kim has leveled several similar threats after other sanctions were passed through 2017.This article was first written by NewsweekMore from Newsweek

Friends, relatives, and co-workers are forever recommending movies—with mixed results. But what if those recommendations came from a more knowledgeable source? The Tribeca Shortlist is a relatively new steaming platform that enlists industry insiders and experts to curate a collection of award-winning films available to stream online. One of the films available in May is Julian Schnabel's The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, which, as actor Tom Hiddleston explains in the exclusive clip above, had a profound impact on him.The 2007 film was a festival favorite and showered with awards and nominations for tackling a seemingly impossible adaptation. As Hiddleston points out, the 1997 book on which the film is based was dictated entirely by Jean-Dominique Bauby—a former journalist suffering from locked-in syndrome—blinking his eyes. It's exactly the kind of film that shouldn't have been a success, and because it works so well, many, including Hiddleston, consider it essential viewing for movie lovers. Hiddleston's entire collection of Shortlist movies is called "Stories of Heartbreak and Humor.""We're taking a more human approach to movie discovery for viewers who want to escape the search spiral and find a great movie fast," Tribeca Shortlist president Jeff Bronikowski said when the platform launched last October. "We've found great movies that we're offering to subscribers as part of a high quality, highly curated movie catalog with exclusive 'Shortlist' content that provides context and personal insight, like getting a recommendation from a trusted friend."The service—available for $4.99 per month—is easy accessible via Apple TV, Amazon Fire TV, Roku, iPhone, iPad, and more.

To this day, I am surprised at the number of people who complain about the Journal's binary storage format. Having spent years working as a system administrator, and after years of working with and on syslog-ng - in the capacity of maintainer of the Open Source Edition for more than a year -, I am increasingly puzzled about all the hostility towards non-text storage formats. I am even more puzzled about the arguments against it. Maybe I'm living in a different world, but there are very, very few reasons I see for using text based storage, when there is a better option available. I've been asked numerous times about my logging needs, and why I am so vigilantly against text based log storage, and this is my attempt at answering those questions.Please note that this is not a journal-apology: I've been deploying binary log storage way before the Journal happened, and my recommended solution is not the Journal either. (Truth be told, I like the idea of the Journal, and am enjoying its features on some machines of mine, but it is not a solution to my needs, and never will be.)(As a side-note, in reply to some of the reactions I've seen, I wrote a followup post.)Table of ContentsRequirementsTo start off, I'll describe my systems and my requirements. I have two setups, with different needs, and I originally used different solutions, but converged to a single one later.The Small OneThe easier setup is my personal setup: my own servers, computers and gadgets. It consists of two VPS machines, a PC at home, two laptops (all of these run Debian) and a Raspberry Pi B (running either OpenELEC, whose logs I do not collect or care about; or Raspbian, which is tied in to the above infrastructure). I used to have a router with custom firmware, but I no longer have that.On average, I have a few hundred messages incoming a second.My requirements here are simple:I need one central place to store my logs. I do not care - nor store - logs on each computer. They all send to a central server, and only hold logs themselves if the central is unreachable. If I lose a few messages here and there, that is no problem.The central must be easy to change. While on the go, possibly without internet access, I do not want my laptops to even try sending to central. So I want to be able to pull up a dummy node locally. I don't care whether the temporary local collector node and the central one are mergeable. If need be, I can export my logs from the local one, and import it into central, but I rarely do that.I want to preserve all logs in an efficient way. I need historic data for experiments and some toy projects of mine.I post-process data, and store a structured, processed version only. I take all my logs, may they come from syslog, the Journal or any other source, and post-process them. I extract out key fields, correlate messages, and so on. I'm only interested in this part of the data, the original messages are discarded.I want to do queries that span programs and machines. One thing I reasonably frequently do, is follow the life of e-mail I send: the logs from Gnus that composed the message from my PC, through msmtpd on the same machine, through postfix on the raspberry pi, then postfix on my remote server. That spans three hosts and four programs. I want to ask my system this: "Show me all the logs for the e-mail with message-id X !", or "Show me all the logs of e-mails I sent today that were delayed more than an hour!", and a number of similar questions.I want reasonably fast and efficient ad-hoc queries. While I post-process my logs, I want to be able to do queries that I came up with on the spot, that work on historic data without having to re-process past logs. Of course, this only has to work for fields that I actually extracted. If I want to introduce a new field, I'll either re-process old data, or only care about new logs.The Big OneA more complex setup is a tiny bit bigger. The bulk of it is a five-node cluster of some beefy machines, which collect about 100Gb of raw logs per node a day from the main application-group running on them.The requirements are similar:We need one central place to store the logs. We do not care - nor store - logs on each computer. They all send to a central server, and only hold logs themselves if the central is unreachable. The central storage is redundant, and the local machines can buffer half

OTTAWA — Conservative leadership candidate Andrew Scheer says universities should lose federal funding if they fail to protect freedom of speech on campus.A "troubling trend" has surfaced where small groups on campus can shut down events, prevent guest speakers from giving lecture and ban activities or clubs they disagree with, Scheer said in an interview Wednesday. "Campuses are no longer the bastions of free speech that they once were."Recent examples include a pro-life group having its event cancelled at Wilfrid Laurier University; a student newspaper at McGill refusing to print pro-Israel articles; and protest surrounding University of Toronto professor Jordan Peterson for his views on gender pronouns."There are a lot of people who come to campus who say things that are outrageous. And I vehemently disagree with them. That I find offensive. Professors or guest speakers who say terrible things about everything from Christianity to capitalism," Scheer said."I just don't go to them. It's as simple as that. And it doesn't bother me. It doesn't keep me up at night. It doesn't make me want to go and tip a car over."Peterson has struck a public nerve with his refusal to adopt people's preferred gender pronouns and concerns around the effect of Bill C-16, the Liberals' gender discrimination bill, on freedom of speech.The bill, which is currently making its way through the Senate, would add gender identity and gender orientation to the Canadian Human Rights Act, thus making it illegal to discriminate against someone on those bases.It would also add these terms to a list, in the Criminal Code, of identifiable social groups that may motivate hate crime or "advocating genocide." (The list already includes sexual orientation, sex and other characteristics — ethnicity, language, disability, etc.)Cacophonous student protests have surrounded Peterson since he made comments last fall dismissing non-binary gender identities and suggesting using the wrong pronouns could suddenly become a crime. One rally resulted in an activist being charged with assault. Peterson received warnings from the university, too, and publicly wondered whether a proposal for federal grant money had been rejected because of the controversy.Scheer, who opposes C-16, held up Peterson's right to articulate his point of view as an example of why more incentives are needed to counteract political correctness on campus."People can disagree with him. People can refute his points, and stand up for what they believe in. But what bothers me is this sense of shutting out any kind of dissent on certain issues. I believe that Canada is a mature enough country that we can have these debates," Scheer said.Under Scheer's proposed policy, fostering and protecting free speech would become a criterion on public post-secondary institutions' grant applications to federal agencies such as the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council, the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council, Canadian Institutes of Health Research and Canada Research Chairs.What bothers me is this sense of shutting out any kind of dissent on certain issuesThe goal isn't to create an extra layer of bureaucracy, Scheer promised. "I would instruct the minister to work with these bodies and come up with an easy way to test for it. I imagine in the early days it would be as simple as responding to complaints."If a university had several incidents and identified a problem on campus, it could show that it was doing something about the problem, he explained, whether pressuring student unions through financial means or putting better security plans in place.Students, and not institutions, are often the source of controversial actions on campus — but "I do believe the university does have a responsibility to step in and prevent small rabble-rousing groups from having an impact," said Scheer.Groups can be loud and proud about controversial views on either end of the spectrum, as long as they don't prevent others from exercising their rights, Scheer said. "If universities are allowing small radical groups to infringe on that, I think they have a responsibility to prevent that."Scheer will face fellow frontrunners including Kevin O'Leary, Maxime Bernier and Kellie Leitch at a final leadership debate in Toronto next week. A new Conservative Party leader will be chosen May 27.Email: mdsmith@postmedia.com | Twitter: mariedanielles
Most of us grew up on the concept of LAMP(Linux apache mysql and php) but there are times when that basic setup can become a real pain to maintain and scale. Generally the hardest part to scale out of a LAMP setup is MySQL. When running a large site with lots of data and traffic optimizing/scaling MySQL can be a really complicated undertaking.That is where NoSQL comes into play. NoSQL is a very board term and some options are better than others. At the moment my choice for a NoSQL database is set firmly with MongoDB. Despite being a relatively new comer to the NoSQL scene MongoDB is quite mature and has awesome documentation.If you are on a *nix platform you can simply use pecl pecl install mongoFor windows you will need to download the MongoDB binaries and the php extensionsAlso don't forget to add the mongo extension to your php.ini extension=mongo.soNow that was easy wasn't it? That is almost always a good sign when the installation is a breezeFor those of us who only have experience with relational databases such as MySQL, Postgresql, etc understanding a Document Oriented database may be a bit difficult at first. Lets start by defining some of the key differences between relational sql databases and non-relational documented oriented databases Documents do not have a predefined schema like tablesJoins are not natively supported but can be manually codedEstablishing a connection with mongo db is really easy $mongo = new Mongo();or you can define an address $mongo = new Mongo('127.0.0.1:1234');Now we must select a database to work with. $db = $mongo->ebooks;//or we can also use$db = $mongo->selectDB('ebooks');It is important to note that if the database does not already exist one will be created auto-magically.Instead of using 'tables' like with a relational sql database we use 'Collections'. Simply put these are collections of documents. From a traditional sql developer standpoint these would be comparable to a database table(collection) and an entry within that table(document). However, this is much for flexible than that. Each document can have sub documents etc.Creating or retrieving a collection: $collection = $db->ebooks;//or like above$collection = $db->selectCollection('ebooks');Just as above, if the collection does not exist one will be created. The max length of the collection name is 128 chars. Although, that includes the db name and indexes. So, it is generally better to stick with a name that is 80 or less chars in length.Inserting a document is really easy $authors = $db->authors;$author = array( 'first_name'=>'Thomas', 'last_name' =>'Johnson', 'website'=>'http://www.tomfmason.net');$author_id = $authors->insert($author);The return value of the insert is the object id. Also, you can pass an additional argument 'safe' which tells mongo to return immediately. This is much faster but you wont know immediately if the insert succeeded or not. That option would be really useful if you were inserting a large number of documents.Lets say we have the following ebook documents in our ebooks collection. $ebook = array( 'title'=>'An introduction to PHP and Mongodb', 'description'=>"Mongodb is an up and coming document oriented database that supports many awesome features including native PHP extension, an easy to use query interface and it is blazing fast. ", 'author_id'=>$author_id, 'reviews'=>array());$ebooks->insert($ebook);and $ebook = array( 'title'=>'php and mongo: A simple scalable CMS tutorial', 'description'=>"Some nice description here. ", 'author_id'=>$author_id, 'reviews'=>array());$ebooks->insert($ebook);We can retrieve the author's ebooks like so $filter = array( 'author_id'=>$author_id);$my_ebooks = $ebooks->find($filter);foreach($my_ebooks as $book) { echo $book['title'] . " "; echo $book['description'] . " ";}Something that caused me a bit of trouble was querying using an id. Lets say our author_id is a string like 4cffb213726e24640d000000. If you tried the following you would get back an empty result $author_id = "4cffb213726e24640d000000"$filter = array('_id'=>$author_id);$author = $authors->findone($
The #DeleteUber hashtag is going around Twitter again, and this time the controversy has nothing to do with the Trump administration. In a blog post published Sunday, former Uber engineer Susan J. Fowler describes the institutional sexism she allegedly encountered while working for the ride-hailing company over the last year, calling the experience "strange, fascinating, and slightly horrifying."Fowler, who left Uber in December and now works at Stripe, says that a few weeks after she started at Uber, her new manager sent her messages explaining that he was in an open relationship and looking for women to have sex with. Fowler took screenshots and reported the incident to HR. She says that while both upper management and HR agreed that he was propositioning her, they said they would only give him a warning because he "was a high performer" and it was his first offense. She writes:I was then told that I had to make a choice: (i) I could either go and find another team and then never have to interact with this man again, or (ii) I could stay on the team, but I would have to understand that he would most likely give me a poor performance review when review time came around, and there was nothing they could do about that. I remarked that this didn't seem like much of a choice, and that I wanted to stay on the team because I had significant expertise in the exact project that the team was struggling to complete (it was genuinely in the company's best interest to have me on that team), but they told me the same thing again and again. One HR rep even explicitly told me that it wouldn't be retaliation if I received a negative review later because I had been "given an option". I tried to escalate the situation but got nowhere with either HR or with my own management chain (who continued to insist that they had given him a stern-talking to and didn't want to ruin his career over his "first offense").Fowler decided to leave the team, but as she got to know other women at the company, she discovered they had similar stories about the manager. "It became obvious that both HR and management had been lying about this being 'his first offense,' and it certainly wasn't his last," she says. "Within a few months, he was reported once again for inappropriate behavior, yet those who reported him were told it was still his 'first offense.'" Eventually the manager left the company for unclear reasons.Fowler goes on to describe "a game-of-thrones political war" in the infrastructure engineering department, with upper managers openly working to undermine each other. Fowler says she was shocked and saddened when her transfer requests were blocked, despite receiving perfect performance scores. After much pushing, she was given only vague explanations, such as "performance problems aren't always something that has to do with work, but sometimes can be about things outside of work or your personal life." She says she eventually found out she was being held back because she was one of the only remaining female engineers:It turned out that keeping me on the team made my manager look good, and I overheard him boasting to the rest of the team that even though the rest of the teams were losing their women engineers left and right, he still had some on his team.When I joined Uber, the organization I was part of was over 25% women. By the time I was trying to transfer to another eng organization, this number had dropped down to less than 6%. Women were transferring out of the organization, and those who couldn't transfer were quitting or preparing to quit. There were two major reasons for this: there was the organizational chaos, and there was also the sexism within the organization. When I asked our director at an org all-hands about what was being done about the dwindling numbers of women in the org compared to the rest of the company, his reply was, in a nutshell, that the women of Uber just needed to step up and be better engineers.In another bizarre incident, Fowler says the company promised to buy everyone in her organization leather jackets, then, at the last minute, the women were told they would only go to the men. They company received a discount for buying 120 men's leather jackets, but there were only about six women still working in the organization. Fowler says a superior explained it wouldn't be fair to buy the women slightly more expensive jackets, and if they wanted them "we women needed to find jackets that were the same price as the bulk-order price of the men's jackets."Fowler says the last straw was when HR called her out for consistently reporting incidents of sexism, and asked her whether she was friends with other female engineers, and what email addresses and chat rooms they used to communicate. A week later, her boss called her in for a meeting:He told me I was on very thin ice for reporting his manager to HR. California is an at-will employment state, he said, which means we can fire

President Obama told Jimmy Fallon on Wednesday that he's "worried" about the future of the Republican Party in light of the rise of presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump. President Obama sat down with Fallon on the set of the Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon for an episode that will air in full Thursday."The truth is actually I am worried about the Republican Party. And-and I know that sounds– you know– you know what it sounds like," President Obama said in response to a question about whether he thinks Republicans are happy with their nominee. "You want the Republican nominee to be somebody who could do the job if they win. And you want folks who understand the issues. And where you can sit across the table from them and you have a principled argument. And ultimately can still move the country forward."President Obama has been increasingly critical of Trump as the primary season ticks on, though he seldom mentions the presumptive nominee by name. The President, reports say, is eagerly awaiting an opportunity to stump for the Democratic nominee so he can lambast Trump further. On the Tonight Show, Obama said he has been pained by the actions of Republicans over the past seven years, but he believes they're ultimately good people."There are wonderful Republicans out in the country who want what's best for the country and may disagree with me on some things but are good, decent people," Obama told Fallon. "But what's happened in that party culminating in this current nomination, I think is not actually good for the country as a whole. It's not something Democrats should wish for."The President's comments come in the wake of widespread backlash aimed at the presumptive GOP nominee, who has questioned whether a judge in a lawsuit against Trump University can be unbiased due to his Mexican heritage. When pressed, Trump also said he did not think a Muslim judge could be unbiased against him given his controversial policy proposal to ban the immigration of Muslims.Obama's statements on the Tonight Show also came just one day after his former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was named the presumptive nominee of the Democratic party. The President has not yet publicly endorsed Clinton, though the White House has indicated it could happen in the future. Obama is scheduled to meet with Sen. Bernie Sanders at the White House on Thursday; White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Wednesday a formal endorsement likely would not come before then.Obama told Fallon that he thinks the Democratic primary has been good for the party. "It was a healthy thing for the Democratic Party to have– a contested primary," Obama said. "I thought that Bernie Sanders brought enormous energy and new ideas. And he pushed the party and challenged them. I thought it made Hillary a better candidate."He added that he hopes the candidates will be able to smooth over the "ouchies" they experienced during the campaign. "This is about the country and the direction we're gonna take it," Obama said. "And I think we're gonna have a great convention and we'll do well."

Screen shot (WSBTV)Parents in Johns Creek, Georgia are upset about a middle school visual rhetoric assignment that asked students to identify and analyze features of a Reconstruction-era editorial cartoon depicting blacks in a situation that is "worse than slavery," WSBTV reports.The cartoon, drawn by lifelong abolitionist Thomas Nast and published in the October 24, 1874 issue of Harper's Weekly, depicts a member of the Ku Klux Klan and a member of the White League shaking hands over a cowering black family. In the background, a black man can be seen hanging from a tree. The image is intended to represent the position that even though institutionalized slavery no longer existed, there were still quasi-governmental structures — like the KKK and the White League — that prevented blacks from enjoying the freedom promised to them.SPONSOREDParents at the Johns Creek school, however, see it differently."It looks like a Ku Klux Klan flyer of a lynching," Emzie Glass told WSBTV. Another parent, Jeff Royster, agreed, saying that "I thought that was pretty over the top for an eighth-grader to have to handle."Both Glass and Royster claim that this is merely the latest in a string of racially insensitive lesson plans devised by the school's eighth grader social studies teacher."He had made a comment that slavery should have not ended with a war, but should have ended with just sentiments in the South changing," Royster said. "They're teaching the things that don't offend whites."Fulton County schools spokeswoman Susan Hale told WSBTV that the district had been made aware of Glass and Royster's complaints, but that it had not been able to substantiate claims that there had been a pattern of racially insensitive lesson planning by this teacher.Fulton County Schools released a statement in which it defended the teaching of the cartoon, but acknowledge that it could have been presented in a more culturally sensitive manner."The political cartoon was included in a packet of class materials about the Civil War and Reconstruction," the statement read. "In retrospect, we regret that it was not shared with students in a more culturally sensitive way and that families were not given the proper context for the material. We are reviewing this situation so we can learn from it."Watch a report via WSBTV below.
"Okay, look, I'm not going to rewrite this paper for you, but I will give you a couple of tips that will help you rewrite it. First, the book title Sons and Lovers does not have an apostrophe in it . . . anywhere. Second, unless your ex-boyfriend is an authority on D.H. Lawrence, don't base your thesis on something he said while making out." – Daria MorgendorfferMuch-loved animated sitcom Daria screened on MTV in the United States for five seasons, beginning in March 1997. A spin-off from Mike Judge's hugely successful Beavis and Butt-head, the series centred on Daria Morgendorffer, a smart, disaffected teenager with a caustic wit.While Daria's favourite TV show, Sick Sad World, featured heavily throughout the series, the show was also filled with literary references. Here are 57 books that Daria read or that were mentioned during the episodes, with links to free eBook editions where available in parentheses.

Daniel Greenfield, a Shillman Journalism Fellow at the Freedom Center, is an investigative journalist and writer focusing on the radical left and Islamic terrorism.Akayed Ullah, a Bangladeshi Muslim living in Brooklyn, really hated Christmas. He hated Christmas so much that he used Christmas tree lights (along with a battery and some wire) as a trigger for a pipe bomb. He filled the pipe bomb with screws so that when it went off, metal shrapnel would tear bloody holes through morning commuters in Manhattan.Wearing a hooded jacket and a backpack to cover the pipe bomb strapped to his body, Ullah got on the F Train at the 18th Avenue elevated subway station off Little Bangladesh. Like the Duke Ellington song says, he switched over to the A Train at Jay Street. It was early morning, but there were plenty of people riding the train. Jay Street is a major transit hub. But Ullah was waiting to blow up somewhere else.He got off in the crush at the 42nd-St. Port Authority station. Here a whole lot of people can be found rushing up and down crowded staircases and shoving their way through cramped corridors.Ullah took the long underground corridor that runs between the Port Authority station and Times Square. He strode past movie and beauty ads. He walked under the discouraging poem, "Overslept, So tired, If late, Get fired, Why bother? Why the pain? Just go home. Do it again." But he wasn't going home. And there would be no opportunities to do it again. The Muslim terrorist was right on time.Rush hour was just getting started in the city that never sleeps. The Muslim terrorist probably passed hundreds of people: not to mention a saxophonist or drummer trying out his act on tired commuters.But he was waiting for something else. Finally he saw it. A Christmas poster.That's when he detonated the pipe bomb using a Christmas tree light near a Christmas poster. Because if there was one thing that Akayed Ullah, like his ISIS masters truly hated, it was Christmas.Last month, ISIS supporters had circulated a poorly photoshopped poster of Santa next to a box of dynamite overlooking Times Square. "We meet at Christmas in New York... soon," it read.As he walked toward Times Square, Ullah appeared determined to carry out the ISIS threat. Using a Christmas tree light in his bomb and detonating near a Christmas poster was a clear statement.Ullah came to this country in 2011. Three years later, he had already been 'radicalized'. The Bangladeshi terrorist had come here on a chain migration link that began with a diversity lottery visa. But Ullah didn't actually like diversity. He didn't want to share a city or country with Christians.And so he set out to kill them.In Ullah's native Bangladesh, Christian churches have shut down midnight mass before due to threats of violence."This is the first time in my life that I find Christians celebrating Christmas with such panic and fear," the Bangladesh Christian Association secretary general had said.But with the diversity visa lottery, you don't have to be a Christian living in Bangladesh to be terrorized by Bangladeshi Muslim violence.And maybe that's a diversity we could do without.That same year, Bangladeshi authorities stopped a Christmas Day plot that involves a suicide bomb vest. But this year, America had its very own Bangladeshi suicide bomber. Christians are readying to celebrate Christmas in Bangladeshi churches this year with metal detectors and thousands of security personnel.But these days that's not just Christmas in Bangladesh. It's Christmas in Europe.Muslim Christmas violence spread terror across Europe last year. These ranged from the 'Kindergarten bomber', a 12-year-old Iraqi who planted a nail bomb in a German Christmas market to the Tunisian refugee who rammed a truck into another German Christmas market killing 12 people and wounding 68. These days, German Christmas markets come with car barriers that are gift wrapped with bows.An estimated 29 'lone wolves' were arrested last year in Christmas terror plots in the UK, France, Brussels and Australia. A number of these plots targeted Christmas markets, carnivals and cathedrals.The year before, a Pakistani married couple had opened fire at a Christmas party at the Department of Public Health in San Bernardino. The worst half of the couple had groused about the Christmas decorations. Previous attack plots had included the Christmas Day bomber (the Nigerian terrorist also known as the underwear bomber) and Portland's Somali Christmas tree lighting bomb plot.This is what a religious war looks like.Muslim violence spikes around Ramadan, and around Christian and Jewish holidays, because Islamic violence is inherently religious in nature. Islamic Supremacist terrorists like Ullah are lashing out at non-Islamic religions in
RICHMOND – Virginia Commonwealth University students receive emails from VCU Health last week reporting two confirmed cases and one suspected case of mumps on campus. Other cases have been reported in the Richmond metro area, and health officials are cautioning students and residents to take precautions.Mumps is a highly contagious disease caused by a virus. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the first signs of the mumps are usually a few days of fever, headaches, muscle aches, tiredness and loss of appetite, followed by swelling of the salivary glands. The disease is preventable by the mumps, measles and rubella vaccine, which most children receive before age 4.VCU hasn't been the only target of the mumps these past weeks. Multiple universities have reported cases to the CDC as well:· U.S. News and World Report reported Monday that Kansas State reached 15 cases of mumps since February.· WTOP reported Wednesday that George Washington University confirmed two cases of mumps there.· At Louisiana State University confirmed 20 cases as reported by WAFB on March 28.· The Seattle Times reported that the University of Washington found 20 cases of mumps that were concentrated in the university's Greek system· Chapman University in California found three cases as of April 6, according to the local Fox station.· Western Illinois University, Appalachian State University and others are all on also the list of universities that have broken out in cases of the mumps in the past few weeks.It is unclear whether the VCU students or students at other universities received the MMR vaccine. However, even with the vaccination, prevention of the virus is not guaranteed. One dose of the vaccine is about 78 percent effect and two doses roughly 88 percent effective.This is not the first time the mumps have hit campuses across the states. According to the CDC, there were similar outbreaks throughout many universities in 2011-2013, 2014 and 2015-2016. One outbreak even went as far as affecting the National Hockey League.Dr. Melissa Viray, deputy director for the Richmond City Health District, said that so far, there is no correlation between the outbreaks and university campuses. But one explanation is that mumps spreads easily when people are in close contact with each other, such as attending the same class or living in the same dormitory.Viray said another reason is that people aren't as concerned as they used to be about diseases like mumps."I think what we are seeing overall, not just in mumps but other preventable diseases, is that people are less afraid of diseases like measles, mumps and polio that they don't push getting a vaccine as much," Viray said. "They may not vaccinate their kids on the advised schedule, and it puts their children at risk."The CDC recommend two doses of the MMR vaccine received at a young age. Even if students have received the MMR vaccinations, students should take extra precautions to avoid the mumps. Wash hands regularly, do not share food or drink and stay home if sick.Words By Mary Lee Clark via VCU Capital News Service

The nexus between the right to keep and bear arms and affirming the right to life is the right to self-defense.Proponents of gun control legislation are often staunch supporters of the nebulous "right to choose" an abortion. Conversely, those who staunchly defend the right to keep and bear arms also frequently take the pro-life position. But to gun control proponents this is an untenable, even contradictory, position; "Guns kill people! They're dangerous and deadly! Their only purpose is to kill! Yet you say you're 'pro-life'? You're a hypocrite!"Such sentiments, however, are based on logical fallacies, emotional reactions rather than rational analysis, and a misunderstanding of the role firearms play in a law-abiding society. In fact, the right to keep and bear arms and the pro-life position are entirely consistent with one another. It's the positions of gun control proponents who are also abortion proponents that don't match.The nexus between the right to keep and bear arms and affirming the right to life is the sanctity of human life and the right to self-defense. Gun controllers fail to grasp, or to acknowledge, that firearms are means to ends; they are objects that possess no ability to act on their own, and have no inherent moral qualities. They cannot choose. They must be directed by human intention, and serve the ends of that intention.A Right to Life Includes a Right to Self-DefenseAs objects, they have no choice or say about how they are used. Their "purpose" is not to kill, but to shoot bullets efficiently. Given the likely billions of rounds fired each year by all firearms in all hands across the United States and the numbers of deaths due to gunshot wounds, which number in the tens of thousands, one can easily realize people put firearms to a great number of uses other than harming humans. To look at overall use, then, firearms are notoriously inefficient at killing, were that their sole "purpose."But human intention is paramount in using any tool or object. There are, broadly speaking, two groups of people: law-abiding and criminal. The intentions they have in employing firearms tend to be perfectly opposite. In fact, criminals intend to deprive someone of life, liberty, or property. This is the motivating force that precipitates the situation to which the law-abiding must react. Law-abiding people who are armed can then bring deadly force to stop the criminal actor.The rights to liberty and property are meaningless in the absence of a right to life. Similarly, the right to life doesn't matter when one is deprived of the right and means to self-defense. Firearms, generally, are the most effective means of self-defense. They are not the only ones, nor is their use always the most appropriate in a given situation. But in the hands of the law-abiding, they are importantly employed to defend the right to life.The right to life is not, however, contingent upon self-defense; self-defense aids and abets it. One does not forfeit one's right to life just because one lacks the means, ability, will, or awareness to defend oneself. The unborn human has a right to life, as does anyone who has not forfeited that right through criminal action and society's legal judgment. But the unborn do not possess the means, ability, will, and awareness to defend themselves; they must be protected.Any society that recognizes the right to keep and bear arms as legitimate means to the right of self-defense must then also recognize its obligation to defend the right to life of the helpless among us.The right to life is mutual, and not exclusive, so long as someone doesn't forfeit it through voluntary criminal action. You have a right to life, as do I, as do the helpless. One's right to life does not exclude the right to life of another.You Can't Control Nature, But You Can Control YourselfBut what, then, to make of gun controllers, and abortionists? They argue on the one hand that they have a right "not to be killed" or to "be safe" or to "have a safe environment." On the other hand, they also argue abortion is necessary for the healthy and happy life of the mother of the to-be-aborted child, and that she, and she alone, may choose when and if to end the life within her.These are untenable positions. There are no rights to "safe environments." Rights are natural to human life. They flow from nature, but depend on human volition and moral choice. It is because we can choose either evil or good that we can and must have rights. But those rights are vis-a-vis other humans only—you have no right to life from circumstance or natural action.Will you indict a tiger, or an earthquake? Bring it up on what charges, to appear in
I hadn't been out long, 20 minutes or maybe half an hour but it was dark by the time I got home. I plonked the few bits I had gone to the shop for on the side in the kitchen and listened. It seemed rather quiet, too quiet really and when I went round to the front room the sofa was empty. When I had gone out they had been sitting together on the sofa. That is where I had left them and it hadn't entered my head they wouldn't still be there when I got home.I sat down on the sofa and pulled off my boots and socks letting my feet rest on the soft red rug that covered the centre of the room. That is when I heard it, or should I say heard her, it was a cross between a groan and yelp and was accompanied by the unmistakable sound of a hand striking flesh. I lay back on the sofa and looked up at the ceiling as if maybe I might be able to see through it. The spanking sound came again and again, like a short round of applause filling the silence of the house. I smiled at the sound and my body's instant response to it, dampness between my thighs.I didn't bother gathering up my discarded boots or socks but left them exactly where I had dropped them. In the kitchen I shoved the few perishables from my shopping trip in the fridge and left the rest sitting in the bags on the side, then flicking off the lights I made way to the bottom of the staircase.I waited at the bottom of the stairs for a moment, listening. Had they heard me in the kitchen and stopped? Then she made a noise again, a low throaty moan and I knew if they had heard me they were ignoring my return home and carrying on. I tiptoed up the staircase and across the landing. The door to our bedroom was closed. I bent down to look through the keyhole but the angle was wrong and all I could see was my wardrobe and some of my clothes scattered on the floor where I had left them earlier in the day.The sound of her voice made me jump"Daddy please" she whimperedArgghhh please what? I thought, please touch me, please fuck me, please spank me more or less or…. my imagination flitted through all these possibilities, jumping from one to another like a little series of pornographic gifs playing in my brain. Every single one of them turned me on and as I pressed my ear tighter against the door one of my hands disappeared down pass the waist band of my leggings and my fingertips sort out the hard nub of my clitoris within the puffy folds of my cunt.She moaned again, but this time it was not accompanied by the sound of spanking, instead I could hear the rustling of sheets and the slight creak of our bed frame shifting under their weight. Our bed, I thought, they are fucking in our bed and I am out here in the dark on the landing listening to them. I should be outraged, insulted, sad, but I was none of those things. Instead I was excited, thrilled even, and my body was responding to the touch of my fingers and the sound of them together and the thoughts in my brain.I pressed me forehead against the door, pushing against it slightly as my fingers rubbed frantically inside my leggings and my ears strained to hear them. The door can't have been properly latched because all of a sudden there was a soft click noise and I felt it give way. I watched as it gently swung open just enough for a shaft of light to come slicing through the gap between the door and the frame sending a beam of light across the landing.I waited to see if they had noticed. Had the noise of the door been enough to alert them to my presence? For a brief moment I thought it had as there was a definite silence on the other side of the door but then it was broken with another groan, but it wasn't her this time, it was him."Oh yes Kitten" followed the groan.Instantly my fingers sprang back into action and I closed my eyes and let all the dirty possible things they might be doing together play through my mind but then I realised, the light, the gap, maybe I could see now and so I inched my way over to where the door met the wall and pressed my eye up against the gap.He was fucking her, she was pinned down on the bed beneath him, his hand holding her wrists above her head, and her legs spread wide and her head thrown back as he pushed himself into the soft flesh of her cunt again and again. In our bed, without me.I could feel my orgasm building inside me but how could I ask, he didn't even know I was here and asking would break the moment, it would reveal me to them as
A No-Brainer: Football Leads to Concussions : Chris Miller Keeps Getting Knocked Out and Keeps Going Back"I think concussions are a little overrated," Ram Coach Rich Brooks said. "People in the game also have knee injuries. They have shoulder problems. I think concussions have been made bigger than life."Another Ram-tough man says there is too much hype about those brain injuries that caused Miller to get lost once for more than an hour on a 20-minute drive home."My belief on concussions is, you get whacked over the head enough, your leaking cerebral fluid thickens into a shell that protects your brain," running back Ron Wolfley said. "Miller's problem is that he has not been hit in the head enough ."ST. LOUIS — One Ram-tough man in this town likes to joke about quarterback Chris Miller and those brain injuries that caused him to forget addresses, telephone numbers and the day of the week.One woman in this town does not agree with either man.Each time an opposing player nears Chris Miller during games, her stomach grabs her. So she grabs somebody--a friend on the couch, a stranger in the stands, anybody.She holds tight until the play is over or the quarterback stands up."Earlier this season, two men sitting in the row in front of me felt my sharp nails and thought I was crazy," she said.The last time Miller didn't stand up, she was so panicked she ran to the field and demanded to talk to the doctor. She doesn't want to think about the next time.She is Jennifer Miller, the quarterback's wife and mother of their two young children. She has watched her husband endure four concussions in the last 13 months.She doesn't talk Ram tough."Before every game, I am a wreck," she said. "I worry about him all the time. My No. 1 interest now is to make sure he comes out of the game in one piece. It's hard. It's very hard."Stepping into this great divide on Sunday against the San Francisco 49ers, as he does every week, is Miller.He has been at his unshaven, barking, swaggering best. He has led a team to first place while ranking sixth in the NFL in passer ratings. He has thrown more touchdown passes than Troy Aikman, 11 to seven, and fewer interceptions than Steve Young, three to four.But he has been quietly, vulnerably, caught between the worries of his family and pressure from his associates.Between outside medical theories that the next concussion could kill him, and arguments from NFL doctors that such proof does not exist.It is a battle that can have many winners.But only one loser.Chris Miller stiffens as if challenged to a fight."I don't want to back down," he says. "That's just the way it is."*Nobody will tell Chris Miller to quit.Not after his head was bounced off the artificial turf in New Orleans last season, causing a concussion that caused him to sit out two starts.Not after he was jolted by the Saints again less than two months later in Anaheim and missed another start because of a concussion.
SHARE THIS ARTICLE Share Tweet Post EmailBankruptcies among oil and gas companies have reached quarterly levels last seen in the Great Recession, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.At least nine U.S. oil and gas companies that accounted for more than $2 billion in debt have filed for bankruptcy in the fourth quarter, the bank said Wednesday in its energy economic update for the final three months of the year."Lower oil prices have taken a significant financial toll on U.S. oil and gas producers, in part because many face higher costs of production than their international counterparts do," according to the note written by Navi Dhaliwal, a research assistant, and Martin Stuermer, a research economist. "If bankruptcies continue at this rate, more may follow in 2016."Since peaking in October 2014, U.S. oil and gas employment has fallen by 70,000 jobs, the analysts wrote in the report.
Flip Saunders couldn't win.You simply cannot trade a superstar, an elite talent and get equal value back.Kevin Love is an elite talent (if you don't see that it speaks to your hoops IQ) and he was forcing a trade — Love wasn't coming back and everyone around the league knew it. That wasn't Saunders' fault — it was all the previous GM David Kahn who screwed up picks to put players around Love (drafting Jonny Flynn over Stephen Curry and Wesley Johnson over DeMarcus Cousins) then insulting Love by not giving him a five-year max rookie contract extension — but Saunders could not repair the relationship. It was too far gone.By the time of the playoffs and Finals this summer Love's agent was working hard to get his client out of Minnesota and to a destination of his choosing, using he hammer of where he would and would not re-sign after this current deal is up. That started the build up.By the time of the draft in June there a buzz and the feeling of pressure — the naive on twitter and some talking heads said, "Saunders needs to trade Love right now, the market is never going to get better." But teams were low-balling Minnesota, thinking there really was pressure and they wanted to get the deal done sooner rather than later.So Saunders walked away. He was patient. He knew the low-ball offers would always be there, he could wait for better.In any negotiation, the guy with the power is the guy more willing to walk away from the table. Saunders was that guy. He took a page out of Masai Ujiri's book when he had the same situation with Carmelo Anthony in Denver — be patient, let a trade market really develop, wait for someone to give you something you really want.Better offers did come in, slowly. Chicago came in with Taj Gibson, Jimmy Butler and future picks, but that was not enough. The Celtics had a nice package of potential picks and young players, but Minnesota wasn't ready to go that route.Then the Warriors came in with a tempting offer but Saunders held out for their most prized rookie contract — Klay Thompson. Golden State wouldn't do it. A team who has great former shooting guards in key decision making positions — consultant/owner Jerry West and coach Steve Kerr — did not want to give up on Thompson and pairing him with Curry. So Saunders waited.Eventually, Cleveland threw Andrew Wiggins in a package. Most likely because LeBron James told them to — part of the reason he returned to Cleveland is he and his guys have a lot more power in the organization there. Once Cleveland got LeBron back they became a win-now team and Love fits that better than the developing Wiggins. Credit LeBron for being a smart GM here.Now the Wiggins for Love deal is set, it just can't be executed until Aug. 23.But that worked for Saunders. If not an outright win, it was as close to it as he would get.Saunders got what he needed — a potential elite player back. We don't know how good Wiggins is going to turn out to ultimately be — he is incredibly talented but has a long ways to go — but Saunders got a young player who at the very least will be part of the future core of this team. If not it's leader and cornerstone. And he got a guy on a rookie deal that he can control for a while (Wiggins will eventually sign some kind of rookie contract extension in Minnesota and likely be there at least seven years, maybe more).Saunders also got Anthony Bennett, a former No. 1 pick who will never live up to that billing but showed at Las Vegas Summer League this year he can become a solid rotation big in the NBA. And he got a future first round pick.Combine that with the potential of Zach LaVine (athletic but a lot farther to go in terms of game feel than Wiggins), plus the still young Ricky Rubio and others you might have something to build on in Minnesota. Saunders will look to move players of some value for assets now — J.J. Barea, Alexey Shved and others — and start to build for the future. In the deep West there is no reason for them to get vets and try to get the eight seed, rebuild the right way. It's about player development in Minnesota.But the key part of rebuilding is getting the cornerstone piece, and Saunders got that.Saunders couldn't win, but he played this all about as well as one can. He deserves a nice golf clap for that.
Kavanaugh accuser Deborah Ramirez "willing to testify," lawyer saysThe White House says it would welcome Senate testimony from Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's other accuser, Deborah Ramirez. She accuses Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct during a drunken college party in the 1980s, a claim he denies. The GOP asked for written details from Ramirez about any witnesses or evidence before they speak on the phone, saying it needs that information to determine how to proceed. Ramirez's lawyer, John Clune, joins "CBS This Morning" from Missoula, Montana, who says he wants to talk before handing anything over. Clune also says admission of gaps in memory helps his client's credibility.

The Cabinet Secretariat is keen on a central database of government and private sector employees who have subscribed to the general provident fund (GPF), public provident fund (PPF) and employees' provident fund (EPF) with Aadhaar as the primary identifier.It has directed the various departments monitoring such savings schemes to ensure that 100% Aadhaar seeding of all salaried accounts takes place by December 31, according to the minutes of the meeting seen by The Hindu .The proposal came up in a meeting chaired by the Cabinet Secretariat with the Ministry of Finance, Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG), Ministry of Communications and Information Technology and the Ministry of Labour and Employment on August 25 to discuss the "interoperability of savings schemes" and linking them to Aadhaar."The objective of meeting is to deliberate on Aadhaar linking of GPF, PPF and EPF accounts of employees, examine the possibility of a centralised repository of employees' fund details with Aadhaar as the primary identifier and establishing portability of fund accounts across organisations," Peeyush Kumar, Joint Secretary [Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) Mission], Cabinet Secretariat, said in the meeting.The Department of Economic Affairs informed that small savings schemes, including PPF, were operated by post offices, public sector and private banks. The Cabinet Secretariat asked the Ministry of Finance to examine whether a centralised platform of all savings schemes was being worked out as all banks had their own systems in place.Employees' informationFor government employees, the Ministry of Finance said that it is developing Employees' Information System, an online salary application system, which may also be used to maintain information related to GPF.While EPF is the savings scheme for private sector employees, the GPF is meant for government employees and PPF can be subscribed to by all workers.The Department of Posts informed the Cabinet Secretariat that 4.7 crore out of 56 crore PPF accounts in post offices were linked with Aadhaar. "All stakeholder departments to ensure 100% Aadhaar seeding of GPF, PPF and EPF accounts by December 31, 2017" the Cabinet Secretariat directed.
Labour wants trade unions excluded from a potential lobbying register and blames the MP who drafted the plan for including them in the first place.Green MP Holly Walker's member's bill would require those who lobby politicians to be registered and adhere to a code of ethics.It passed its first reading with unanimous support from all parties, but Labour has since put forward an amendment that would exclude trade unions.The unions are major backers of the Labour Party.Despite Labour's stance, the Greens are confident the bill can pass through Parliament with the support of National and other parties.Ms Walker told a select committee yesterday that the bill was drafted too widely and she expected it to be changed during the parliamentary process.However, she did not believe trade unions should be excluded altogether. Rather there was room to close other loopholes so small and non-profit organisations were not unfairly burdened."We need to have transparency about who has access and influence in that system. We think the public has a right to know who's influencing members of Parliament and on which issues."The lobbying register also had to be practical and fair, she said.Labour MP Trevor Mallard said the bill was a "bad piece of work" and should have been tidied up before going to select committee.It would currently capture a union official who rang him to help with a constituent's housing problem, or a foodbank that wanted assistance getting a client welfare entitlements, he said.Labour MP Ruth Dyson said the New Zealand culture was different from its foreign counterparts and easy access to politicians was part of that."People stop us in the supermarket and give us an earful of their view . . . It takes me a long time to do shopping and I love it."People had a right to have a say and she was concerned the bill could intimidate them and stifle debate. "We have those paid lobbyists. We know who they are - New Zealand is a village."National Party whip Michael Woodhouse said trade unions were influential lobbyists.
French wife of Norwegian neo-Nazi released from custody: sourcePARIS - Agence France-PresseOfficers from the Interior Security Intelligence Services (DCRI) store pieces of evidence in a car on July 18, 2013 near the main police station in Brive-la-Gaillarde, southwestern France, where Norwegian black metal rocker and convicted killer, Kristian Vikernes, is still in custody and questionned by the anti-terrorist services. AFP photoA French woman arrested with her husband, Norwegian extremist Kristian Vikernes who is suspected of plotting a "major terrorist act", has been freed from custody, a judicial source said Wednesday.Vikernes and his wife Marie Cachet were arrested on Tuesday at their home in a village in the central Correze region of France. The interior ministry said Vikernes, a black metal musician and convicted killer, was "close to the neo-Nazi movement" and could have been preparing a "major terrorist act".Vikernes, who also goes by the name "Varg", Norwegian for "wolf", had been under surveillance for several years.But anti-terrorism authorities in Paris opened a probe into the father-of-three at the beginning of the month after his wife purchased weapons -- albeit legally as she has a permit.Officers seized five long-range weapons at their home including four 22 caliber Long Rifles.Vikernes is notorious for having stabbed to death a guitarist from another black metal band. He spent 16 years in prison for the crime.Interior Minister Manuel Valls conceded that they had as yet identified "no target, no plan", but intelligence chiefs had decided it was important "to act before and not afterwards"."The DCRI (French domestic intelligence service) considered that messages he had posted on the Internet expressed huge violence." Vikernes' former lawyer in his murder trial on Wednesday criticised France for the arrest, calling the charges against him "thin."
JERUSALEM — A famously child-friendly country with a federally subsidized universal health care system that offers free fertility treatments, Israel has made it easier for economically distressed women to obtain an abortion.The 2014 "health basket" of medical services and medications approved by Israel's cabinet Sunday (Jan. 5) includes free abortions for Israeli women aged 20 to 33, regardless of the circumstances.The $4.6 million earmarked by the Health Ministry committee will cover some 6,300 abortions for women who cannot afford the procedure.In 2013, almost 20,000 women received permission to abort from hospital termination committees, according to Efrat, an organization that encourages women considering abortion to have their babies.Until now, government-funded abortions have been reserved for women younger than 19 or older than 40, and in cases where the fetus has a severe defect, the mother's life is endangered, or the pregnancy is a result of sexual abuse. If a woman believed the pregnancy would cause her harm, physically or emotionally, she had had to pay for the procedure herself.Ruth Tidhar, who heads Efrat's assistance department, said that in a country like Israel, where mothers receive paid maternity leave and preschool education is heavily subsidized, "it gives a mixed message when contraceptives aren't funded by the government while abortions are."Judaism does not share the Roman Catholic belief that life begins at conception, but various Jewish streams have a range of opinions on the issue. The one thing most Jews agree on: That abortion is always permissible if the mother's life is in danger.Rabbi David Stav, the head of Tzohar, a modern-Orthodox rabbinical organization, criticized the new abortion guidelines.In a TV interview on Arutz Sheva, Stav said it is "immoral" for the state to fund abortions that result from a mother's "personal decisions" rather than serious medical problems."The state (will be) allocating resources for personal decisions," said Stav that are "forbidden by Jewish law."Copyright: For copyright information, please check with the distributor of this item, Religion News Service LLC.
Times public editor Margaret Sullivan has a post up taking Nate Silver to task for daring Joe Scarborough to a bet over who would win the election. Basically, she says making a bet like this diminishes the Times and he shouldn't have done it. That may be so. I don't know and don't really care.But she concludes with this line …When he came to work at The Times, Mr. Silver gained a lot more visibility and the credibility associated with a prominent institution. But he lost something, too: the right to act like a free agent with responsibilities to nobody's standards but his own.I say this as an admirer of Silver and the Times. But I think this is almost a demonstrably false assumption and a sign Sullivan doesn't fully grasp the politics and new media environment Silver operates in.I've been attacking those who've been attacking Silver lately and I know that probably makes me seem like I'm some Silver diehard or something. But the reason he's getting attacked so ferociously on the right now is precisely because he's viewed as being the standard for poll prognostication. And his 'odds', which make Obama an almost overwhelming favorite, are seen by Republicans as really really damaging.Here's what Sullivan doesn't get. There are 7 or 8 different organizations running different flavors of systematic presidential poll analysis right now. They range from Silver to sites like TPM and RCP and Pollster to academic political scientists. And they all show pretty much the same numbers that Silver's showing. But Silver's the one who has the public rep as the brainiac polling-meister so he's the one everybody's focused on — both Dems who want to believe his numbers (and who tend to favor more science/evidence based analysis) and Republicans who desperately want him to be wrong. That is almost the definition of public credibility, which is what the Times purchased when they made their deal with him.Again, everybody is showing basically the same thing. But he's the lightning rod, pro and con.Like a number of media personalities/experts (and I mean that in a positive sense), Silver is not really reliant on the Times at all. He's his own brand. In the political realm he built it in the 2008 cycle (he obviously had a baseball sabermetrics rep before that).I don't think there's any question the Times gained considerably more than he did in the bargain. That's why I suspect they're paying him quite a lot of money and he was able to negotiate a deal in which the entire 538 franchise is still his. He's just leasing it to them.
Not everyone came to Yankee Stadium last weekend for New York City FC's home opener.Some came for a wedding.NYCFC supporters Patrick Rivera and Tirzah Gonzalez redefined the term "pregame celebration," gathering with dozens of fellow New York City Supporters Club members to celebrate their wedding beneath the shadow of Yankee Stadium."The experience was nothing like I expected," the blushing bride told MLSsoccer.com. "I thought it would be he and I and maybe 10 people if we were lucky."Instead, Patrick and Tirzah were swarmed by family and friends as they dashed across River Avenue from The Dugout to the outer facade of Yankee Stadium, decked out in traditional wedding garb. Accompanying them was Blue Ladies' supporter, Mei-Ling Hyler; a licensed state officiate who brought the necessary paperwork from City Hall along with her.Passers-by watched on in confusion as a herd of light blue fans escorted the elegant bride and groom to the walls of Yankee Stadium, taking in the ceremony beneath the tracks of the 161st Street subway station."This was absolutely the ceremony," Tirzah said. "We went to New York City's City Hall, got our paper work and all that jazz. The [licensed state officiate] signed it, our two witnesses signed it and so did we and in the mail it went!"(Credit: Patrick Rivera and Tirzah Gonzalez)This unconventional wedding is as unique as the couple themselves. A year prior, Patrick surprised his then-girlfriend with an impromptu proposal.And wouldn't you know it? Soccer was at the center of that moment as well."Patrick and I were at the Chicago Fire match on May 15, where coincidentally we drew," Tirzah recalled. "At halftime, he got on one knee. I initially thought he dropped something. So I looked under my seat to try to help him out."When I look up, he's holding a smoke bomb ring and he asked me to marry him. I told him to stop messing with me, halftime is almost over and I really wanted to grab some food."He assured me he was being sincere," she said. "When I saw how serious he was, I broke down crying and said a very firm yes."Bringing together their closest friends within the NYCFC supporters groups (Los Templados, Rotten Apples, English Blues, Blue Ladies and more), Tizrah and Patrick declared their vows for all to see – and it was everything they hoped it would be.(Credit: Patrick Rivera and Tirzah Gonzalez)"Some people wore suits, ties, dresses. They were crying! We were crying. I'm still crying! But so blessed," Tirzah said. "I don't think there are enough words to describe how lucky I felt. How humbled."Every single person there will forever be a part of one of the biggest moments of our lives and that will never be forgotten."

The Apsara Authority on Saturday threatened to take legal action against the individuals behind a series of photographs showing a woman posing topless at the Angkor Archaeological Park in Siem Reap City, calling the images "inconsiderate and pornographic."The photos, which drew the ire of many Cambodian Facebook users who shared them over the weekend, show an Asian woman standing among temples in the park wearing harem pants, a headscarf and nothing else. The images were originally posted to the "Wanimal" photography blog—which features photos of nude or partially nude women, often posing in public places—in October 2013 with the caption "Khmer Lady.""Wtf …..,I wanna kill her from now," commented one Facebook user on Saturday.In a more diplomatic tone, the Apsara Authority, the government body that manages the archaeological park, also denounced the images on the same day."The Apsara Authority strongly condemns the half-naked body of the woman standing in front of the temples, because taking naked photos is an act that is totally against Khmer ethics and culture," the authority says in a statement."The Apsara Authority…has decided to take legal measures by any means in order to punish the inconsiderate and pornographic act."The authority derives its name from a French acronym that spells out "APSARA," a reference to the celestial nymphs of Hindu and Buddhist mythology. Apsaras are often depicted in paintings, carvings and sculpture as bare-breasted women; the authority features one such bare-breasted apsara image on its website.Long Kosal, deputy director of the Apsara Authority's communications department, said Sunday that the photos appear to have been taken at the Preah Khan and Banteay Kdei temples."Based on our initial research, we found that this group is based in China and is skilled in producing pornographic pictures," he said.Mr. Kosal said the Apsara Authority had not yet identified the photographer or model, who he insisted was not Cambodian.Ry Anhchealy, deputy director of the provincial department of culture and fine arts, said that photographs and other depictions of shirtless females at the temples were inappropriate, regardless of the fact that many of the temples are adorned with carvings of topless women."That happened 1,000 years ago, so we don't want to comment on it, but you are asking me in 2015, so this is a different matter…. It is wrong."(Additional reporting by Ben Woods)[email protected]© 2015, The Cambodia Daily. All rights reserved.

BEIJING: In a country where anything from chopsticks to slippers can be designed to look like pandas, one Chinese energy company is going a step further by building 100 solar farms shaped like the bears along the route of the ambitious Belt and Road initiative.Panda Green Energy Group has already connected one such 50-megawatt (MW) plant to the grid in the northern province of Shanxi, the first step in a public relations stunt that emphasises the cuddly side of the world's second largest economy.AdvertisementBuilt with darker crystalline silicon and lighter-coloured thin film solar cells, the plant resembles a cartoon giant panda from the air.The Hong Kong-based firm is currently in talks with Canada, Australia, Germany and Italy to launch more panda-shaped power stations.The Belt and Road initiative is a plan to emulate the ancient Silk Road by opening new trade corridors across the globe using roads, power lines, ports and energy pipelines.A 100-MW panda power plant would be expected to generate 3.2 billion kWh of energy over 25 years, according to the company, capable of supplying power to over 10,000 households annually.AdvertisementAdvertisementPanda Green Energy is currently constructing its second panda power plant in Shanxi, which accounts for a quarter of China's coal reserves.Utilisation of one panda solar power plant will save the equivalent of a total 1.06 million tonnes of coal and cut emissions of greenhouse gases by 2.74 million tonnes in 25 years, the company said.The firm has been investing in and running solar power plants in China's major solar hubs such as Xinjiang and Qinghai province, as well as some solar projects in Britain.Shanxi aims to install 12 gigawatts of solar capacity by 2020 versus 1.13 gigawatts installed in 2015.
On their third album, the War on Drugs essentially continue to stake out their own particular patch of ground in 21st century rock & roll with an indie bent, nodding in equal parts toward older traditions and newer ones with a difference of two decades in between them, captured right down to the cover art, which is pretty much a companion piece to the art on their second album Future Weather. On the one hand, there's still a sense of world-weary wisdom and lost Americana as such at work from the start, as the extended breakdown toward the end of "Best Night" demonstrates, all silvery guitar jamming and sparkling piano following from Adam Granduciel's reedy singing. At the same time the diffuse qualities of feedback, psychedelic glaze, and textural experimentation via everything that fed into what became shoegaze (not to mention shoegaze itself) remain key, audible in the opening chimes of "Brothers" and "It's Your Destiny"'s spaced-out and exultant flow, perhaps most notably on the short instrumentals "Original Slave" and "Come for It." If the basic balance remains unchanged, the result has been a sound just enough of the War on Drugs' own as a result, which gets stronger and even more droned out and powerful as the album continues. More than once they find just the right way to make it all click into something even more distinct, like the higher-pitched croon on "I Was There" slipping out over a gentle chug underpinned by darker feedback shadings or the Motorik-as-classic-rock-anthem "Come to the City," which practically begs a massive arena/light show performance (little surprise the later instrumental "City Reprise #12" takes that feeling and runs with it even more triumphantly). "Your Love Is Calling My Name" is the album's clearest barnburner, with a brisk, sharp pace and Granduciel riding-the-freeway-referencing lyrics with an appropriate easygoing elan, all while feeling warm and enveloping around the edges (and especially on the great instrumental break leading back into a wonderful, focused guitar part).
US Carbon Tax "Close To Inevitable," Conservative Leader Proclaims — Moral Disgrace Of Ignoring Global Warming Too StrongJune 10th, 2016 by Zachary ShahanNot working to stop global warming is one of the most disgraceful, horrible things a policymaker can do. It demonstrates a complete lack of morals — unless the policymaker is simply ignorant, but that is very barely a legitimate excuse these days, given that the opinions of thousands of climate scientists are almost 100% that humans are causing unprecedented global warming that could destroy society.Starting from ABC, the question for some may remain "Why is the Republican Party still opposing the existence of this unprecedented societal threat and strong global warming action?"For some in party leadership, the story is clear: they are closely tied to one or more fossil fuel industries, and they are selfishly ignoring the science and fighting the solutions out of pure greed and corruption.While fossil fuel companies send a ton of cash into Republican policymakers' piggy banks, I don't actually think that's the direct reason for most Republican congresspeople's opposition. While congresspeople have a great number of resources available to them, they still just have 24 hours in the day, and their "resources" can very easily be biased or misinformed. Relying on party leadership and the conservatives who "call the shots" for guidance on how to respond to a specific issue, the simple story could be that most of these policymakers don't take the time to look deeply into the matter with an objective mind, and follow suit with the corrupt and lying Republican leaders who are heavily invested in the burning of deadly fossil fuels. I still think this is a moral #fail of a very high order, because no matter how much you know, you have to know that the truth regarding this matter is hugely important to billions of humans and the future of the human race, in general.And I think that is where opposition to global warming solutions like a carbon tax (or carbon fee & dividend that sends the revenues from a carbon fee right back to the people of the United States, resulting in no net increase in taxes) is breaking down. A growing number of conservatives have learned enough about global warming and climate change that they are eager to change the party line or even break the party line in order to get stronger US climate action moving. The latter would be a huge deal, because Republican congresspeople are known to vote in lockstep, taking orders from the party leadership without dissent, to a rather insane degree. Freedom of thought is not a cherished ideal when it comes votes on just about anything, but especially this topic — everyone with the GOP badge is expected to fall in line. Some congresspeople who have broken the party line on this topic later had to face difficult primaries in which their opponents were heavily backed by Republican movers and shakers and almost without exception (or maybe without exception) lost their seat.But there is reportedly talk that Republican congresspeople with a conscience who have done their duty and taken the time to learn about global warming are getting restless. They don't want the United States, and especially the Republican Party, to be in the history books for costing us millions (or more) lives, tens of trillions of dollars of damage, and unquantifiable suffering simply to extend the wealth of some polluting billionaires and millionaires.POLITICO reports on the following recent statements from US conservative leaders:Eli Lehrer, the president of the free-market think tank the R Street Institute: " In the long run, a carbon tax or something like it is probably close to inevitable. "" Jerry Taylor, president of the libertarian think tank the Niskanen Center: " There are some Republicans, more than you might think, who are deeply uncomfortable with the party's position on climate change. " (As they should be!)" (As they should be!) Aparna Mathur, a resident scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute: "It is worrying to me that the House would consider legislation to oppose a common-sense approach to addressing climate change. Instead of relying on dozens of federal and state regulations that themselves are costly, a carbon tax would be transparent and cost-effective." (This is in response to the likelihood that the US House of Representatives is about to prematurely vote against a carbon tax in order to try to build momentum against the option, should it become a serious possibility in the coming year or so.)We have reported (via Think Progress) in the past on conservative leaders who support a carbon tax, or carbon fee & dividend:Former Representative Bob Inglis (R-SC) said years ago that a carbon tax "really is a conservative position."The Cato Institute's Peter van Doren noted the obvious: "So, if fossil fuel combustion produces byproducts that cause negative health effects on third parties as well as changes in the temperature of the atmosphere, the obvious lesson from economics is to increase fossil fuel prices
Pam Bondi.On September 13, 2013, the Florida Attorney General's office announced that it was considering taking legal action against Trump University, amid allegations that the real-estate investment school had defrauded its student body.Four days later, Donald Trump's personal charity (illegally) donated $25,000 to a political group aligned with Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi's reelection campaign. Shortly thereafter, the Sunshine State's chief prosecutor decided that there were "insufficient grounds" to proceed with a probe of the mogul's school.Last summer, the Associated Press revealed that Bondi had personally solicited a donation from Trump — around the same time that her office was debating whether to pursue an investigation of his university.At a 2015 GOP primary debate, Trump boasted of his talent for buying favors from politicians, explaining, "When they call, I give. And you know what? When I need something from them, two years later, three years later, I call them, and they are there for me."This fall, Trump agreed to pay out $25 million to those who did bring suit against his school.On Thursday — less than two months after Trump won a presidential election on a promise to "drain the swamp" of D.C. corruption — his transition team told Bloomberg that Pam Bondi will take a job in the new White House.In a more rational political universe, that last development would never follow the preceding ones. Why would a president-elect with populist pretensions go out of his way to heighten the visibility of an attorney general whom he, at the very least, appears to have paid to drop a fraud case against him, using money that was earmarked for charity?But, in our fallen realm, the answer is simple: Because, apparently, he can.
Missing sailor's wife gives evidence at coronial inquestUpdatedThe first day of a coronial inquest into last year's disappearance of three sailors off Townsville in north Queensland has heard evidence from the skipper's wife that her husband was well prepared for the trip.Skipper Derek Batton, Peter Tunstead and his brother James Tunstead sailed out of Airlie Beach on the Kaz 2 catamaran on the April 15, 2007.Five days later the 10-metre sailing boat was found drifting outside the Great Barrier Reef off Townsville with no sign of the three men.Their wives and children have flown from Perth for the inquest.The first witness to give evidence this morning - Jennifer Batton - said she and her husband had previously taken the Kaz 2 out on two trips with no problems.She told the inquest her husband and neighbour Peter Tunstead had taken 10 weeks to plan the trip and they had allowed six to eight weeks and planned to stay reasonably close to the shore.Topics: law-crime-and-justice, missing-person, accidents, maritime, disasters-and-accidents, townsville-4810, airlie-beach-4802, qld, waFirst posted

It can happen to anyone at any time. One minute you're feeling an indescribable vibrancy and next an emptiness. It has sidelined the most talented cuppers in the field for minutes; hours in more severe cases. We are talking about the world of professional coffee tasting and it's most common ailment–palate fatigue!Professional coffee tasters, like our own Paul Massard and Stormin' Norman, put their taste buds on the line every day by cupping coffee for hours. With the daily cupping process come hazards and risks like burnt tongues, self-inflicted tongue bites and worst of all, palate fatigue.What is palate fatigue?Also known as taste bud exhaustion or sensory enervation, palate fatigue occurs when tasting a multitude of comparable products consecutively. In the realm of coffee, palate fatigue often strikes during the cupping process. During a cupping, slurping and slurping for hours on end could take a toll on your ability to distinguish between the different flavor notes of coffee.Why does palate fatigue happen?Many believe that palate fatigue occurs when your nose and taste buds are simply overworked. But researchers believe otherwise. Their theory is that your brain, not the sensory receptors on your tongue, becomes fatigued with similar sensory information. This is a more solid theory because our brains function like computers. When we experience something with our senses, it sends a data signal to the brain. The brain then decodes the data into a sensory profile we can then experience. When multiple similar data signals are sent in rapid succession, the brain begins to mix up the signals and creates false readings (AKA palate fatigue).Are there other types of palate fatigue?As a consumer, you've probably experienced a condition very similar to coffee palate fatigue at your local department store's fragrance section. After sniffing several different fragrance cards, they all start to smell the same. This is a form of palate fatigue that affects the nasal palate (it just so happens that coffee is the palate cleanser to smell when trying on perfumes. What a coincidence!).How does one prevail against palate fatigue?The simple answer is to just take a break from tasting–give your brain a chance to clear its cache.If you don't have the luxury of time, do what the pros do and employ a palate cleanser.Lastly, as any athlete will tell you, the best way to prevent exhaustion is through conditioning and endurance. The most physically fit palates often belong to Q graders and chefs. This is because experts have spent years conditioning their palates with High Volume Taste Training (or HVTT).Palate fatigue knows no bounds; the key is to stop it before it (for lack of a better term) leaves a bad taste in your mouth. Be prepared! Remember to do as the pros do–rest, cleanse or prevent palate fatigue all together by employing a little HVTT.Want to see how you stack up against the pros in the world of professional tasting? Take a tour for a chance to cup with the masters!

Prior to the Family and Medical Leave Act , workers in the United States didn't have any protection under the law for family or medical-related leave. That meant that your boss could legally fire you for taking time off to care for your kids, yourself or a sick relative.The impetus for the law came after the formal recognition that "t he lack of employment policies to accommodate working parents can force individuals to choose between job security and parenting," and that " due to the nature of the roles of men and women in our society, the primary responsibility for family caretaking often falls on women."The law ensures 12 weeks of unpaid leave for all U.S. workers for every 12-month period to care for themselves or a loved one. Although women were at the forefront of this fight, it allowed all workers to acquire much-deserved time off for caretaking.
Story highlights Boy's lawyer says his client "really kind of doesn't have an idea of what is going on"Tristen Kurilla, 10, is charged with homicide as an adultPolice say the boy admitted killing Helen Novak, 90, after she yelled at himKurilla told police he grabbed a cane and put it against Novak's throat and punched her"I killed that lady," the 10-year-old boy told a Pennsylvania state trooper, after a 90-year-old woman was found dead in the home of the boy's grandfather.Tristen Kurilla, a fifth grader, made the chilling confession Saturday, police said, after his mother brought him to the Pennsylvania State Police Barracks in Honesdale, about 140 miles north of Philadelphia.Now, Kurilla is being held at the Wayne County Correctional Facility and charged as an adult with criminal homicide, the Wayne County district attorney's office said. The boy is separated from adult offenders and is being constantly supervised, CNN affiliate WBRE reportedThe boy admitted to grabbing a wooden cane, holding it against 90-year-old Helen Novak's throat for several seconds and punching her in the throat and stomach, according to the police affidavit.Kurilla told police he was angry at Novak because she had yelled at him when he entered her room. He said he wanted to ask her a question.Were you trying to kill her? the trooper asked the boy."No, I was only trying to hurt her," Kurilla replied, according to the affidavit.The boy was ordered to be held without bail after his arraignment and is set to appear in court October 22.Bernie Brown, his lawyer, said he was petitioning the court to get the fifth-grade Damascus Elementary School student out of jail, WBRE reported."Tristen really kind of doesn't have an idea of what is going on," Brown told the station.Brown added, "Jail is still jail, no matter what part of the facility you are in."Brown also can petition a judge to transfer the case to juvenile court.Janine Edwards, Wayne County district attorney, said Pennsylvania law made it mandatory "that a criminal homicide charge be first directly filed in adult court by the prosecutor regardless of the age of the perpetrator," WBRE reported."It is not a choice I made," she told the station, adding that a juvenile detention center will not accept a child charged with homicide. "It's not a choice the warden made. It's not a choice Pennsylvania State Police made."The age of the defendant was unusual, she told the station."That's not something I've seen," she said. "I'm not sure how many times that's been seen in Pennsylvania or not."Police were initially called to the home of Kurilla's grandfather, Anthony Virbitsky, in Damascus Township on Saturday morning with a report that an elderly woman had died there, the affidavit said. Virbitsky was the woman's caretaker, authorities said.The county coroner responded to the home, found Novak's body and transported it to the morgue, the affidavit stated.A few hours later, the boy's mother, Martha Virbitsky, appeared at the state police post with her son and told Trooper John Decker that the boy had confessed to killing Novak, the affidavit said.The boy's mother told police that she "has had a lot of trouble with Tristen and that he has some mental difficulties" and had been violent in the past, the affidavit said.Kurilla had told his grandfather that Novak was bleeding from the mouth, but denied having done anything to her, Decker wrote in the affidavit.Anthony Virbitsky told police he checked on Novak but found no blood, although she was breathing heavily. He asked her if she wanted to go to a hospital, the affidavit said, but she refused. When he went to check on her less than an hour later, she was dead, Virbitsky told police, and then his grandson confessed that he had hit her.An autopsy performed Monday discovered "blunt force trauma to Novak's neck" and her death was ruled a homicide, the district attorney's statement said.Some residents in Damascus Township took issue with locking up the boy in the county jail."I know they see a lot of things but I don't think that they understand what they're doing," Kristy Tirney told WBRE. "I don't know."

Santi Cazorla has revealed that he's had skin from his arm grafted onto his ankle after a wound, resulting from a December operation on his plantaris tendon, failed to heal.The Spain international has also confirmed that the latest procedure, undertaken in Sweden, has left him stuck on crutches and unlikely to play again this season."I had to have a minor operation to close the scar that had opened," Cazorla told Spanish radio station Onda Cero."It was nothing serious but I still had to go to the hospital [on Thursday afternoon]."I had a graft done on my ankle a month-and-a-half ago because the skin on my ankle was practically dead and that was the reason why the wound would not close when I first had my operation in Sweden."Everything was going well until I started to do some exercises on the bicycle. The skin opened again and the stitches gave in. We hope this is the last one and I can return as soon as possible."I can't do anything, that is the worst thing about this situation, that it doesn't depend on me," he added."It's not a case of how much work I put in, I need for the wound to close. I just have to wait to see how the new skin that they took from my arm adapts."I now have to wait two weeks to see if the wound and the scar close. That is my biggest concern. I know I have to be optimistic and deal with it in the best possible way."Cazorla, who was a mainstay of Arsene Wenger's starting lineups in the opening part of the season, has been badly missed during the middle portion of the season. He too is missing his teammates and the cut and thrust of life in the Premier League."I want to return as soon as possible," he said. "I miss going to training, being with my teammates and playing. Right now I have to stay at home, move with crutches and it's a difficult situation to deal with."I still have one year left on my contract and my only desire is to return to playing and to compete at the highest level."Arseblog News wishes Santi all the best, we miss his dancing feet and his little smile.
How would college students deal with the ISIS?"The O'Reilly Factor" sent Jesse Watters to the streets of major college town Boston to find out. He asked some young citizens what their strategy would be to handle the brutal terror group.The only problem? Most people Watters spoke to didn't even know what ISIS is. A couple young ladies even suggested that we were at war with "the Icelandic State" or some strange place called "Pakistanian."Watch the hilarious video above.Poll: Millennials are Social Liberals, Fiscal Centrists
Are women oppressed today? If so, why is it that they live more? Why are they happier?Long-time political activist Adam Leonas examines the arguments about the oppression of women, and shows that all the supposed disadvantages are essentially trade-offs against much worse alternatives.He takes a fascinating look into the biology of the sexes, to find where female superiority and male weakness is located: sex. He argues that the point in history when the prehistoric gender balance was overturned was during "the worst mistake in human history": the Agricultural Revolution, when what he calls "the Female Coup d'etat" took place.The author, being unrelentingly radically progressive, concludes that in historic societies, capitalism included, women's power is greater due to their control over sex. He proposes radical ways for men to deal with their disadvantaged position, as well as radical ways to remedy the gender balance in society as a necessary prerequisite for equality and social peace.Read excerpts from the book.The Table of Contents.Review by National Coalition for Men PR Director J.

Birgitta Ohlsson, one of Sweden's staunchest advocates of equal rights and The Local's Swede of the Week, has had a busy week. The vibrant colours of Stockholm's Pride Week have been sullied by news of Russia's anti-gay laws, which among other things ban "propaganda for non-traditional sexual relations."Ohlsson has been working to ensure Sweden leads the international fight against the laws – something that resulted in her being pelted with eggs during a speech at a Pride event in Lithuania on Saturday.SEE ALSO: Topless activists demonstrate outside Russian Embassy"When it comes to countries like Russia I think it's so important to have a united front towards the negative messages that are coming from them, and Sweden is one of the key players in this dialogue," she told The Local.She added that she was pushing the European Union's foreign affairs spokeswoman Catherine Ashton into sharing a "very solid and firm position" on condemning the politics in Russia.SEE ALSO: A list of The Local's past Swedes of the Week"Of course, we have the horrifying anti-gay law – that is repulsive and disgusting, going in the total wrong direction. But then we have other laws that are also very severe for the Russian open civil society and that has to do with laws concerning freedom of expression, freedom of assembly," she said."Other countries are not holding to the position as they should when it comes to human rights and the rule of law."Russia, she claimed, needs to perform a complete U-turn:"[Russia is] not respecting LGBT human rights.

(Photo: Hilary Swift/RGJ)Buy Photo4:20 p.m. update:Legislative leaders reached by phone Thursday took a largely wait-and-see approach to news that Musk is asking for a $400 million-$500 million incentive package from the state that ultimately wins the gigafactory. They said they want to see the details first."Any time that we can lure a new industry with a real return on our investment, that's always something we should be looking at," said Assembly Speaker Marilyn Kirkpatrick, D-North Las Vegas. In the past, Kirkpatrick has been a critic of tax incentives that eat into education funds and has demanded more reporting on the results of incentives awarded by the state.Senate Majority Leader Mo Denis, D-Las Vegas, echoed Kirkpatrick's stance, saying new business is good for the state but he would have to review any incentive package that takes shape. State economic development officials have refused to comment on what incentives are being offered to Tesla."We want to diversify our economy so we want to attract good projects to come here," Denis said. "I'm in support of that. But we'll have to see all the specifics."Assembly Minority Leader Pat Hickey said Nevada is an attractive location even without offering the kind of huge cash incentives available in states like Texas."Our location, our current tax structure, the transportation availability, the access to lithium," Hickey said. "I think Nevada is a pretty good deal because of what we have to offer regardless of incentives."3:21 p.m. update:At the Economic Development Authority of Western Nevada, CEO Mike Kazmierski says it will be tough to compete with bigger states for the gigafactory in terms of dollars but Nevada has other advantages.Kazmierski on Nevada's gigafactory chances: "I'd be reticent to say anything's been decided. We just have to make them see our advantages."CLOSE What you need to know about today's announcement.

Check in married — check out single!An upstate resort famous for its lavish weddings will ironically serve as the venue for "Divorce Hotel" — a business that promises couples a painless split in an idyllic setting.For a flat $5,000 fee, the divorcing parties are put up in separate rooms at Saratoga Springs' Gideon Putnam Resort for a weekend and work with a mediator to finalize the details into a signed agreement."Practically, they are divorced after signing on Sunday," founder Jim Halfens, who already runs similar projects in his native Netherlands, told The Post. "After signing, all work is done and we send it to a judge who only puts a stamp on it to make it official."Halfens expects to start up his services at the end of September.He believes the main clientele will be New Yorkers looking for a speedy split — but any US citizens can participate as long as they agree to use the provided mediators and lawyers.Some guests will participate in a reality TV show, but most will conduct their marriage terminations in private.They want people to get into an environment that minimizes the stress of the situation and that's exactly what we offer. - Rob Sgarlata, hotel representativeHalfens reached out to the Gideon Putnam about two weeks ago, according to Rob Sgarlata, a representative for the hotel."They want people to get into an environment that minimizes the stress of the situation and that's exactly what we offer," said Sgarlata, whose resort has golf courses, swimming pools, hiking trails and spa treatments.Sgarlata does not think adding Halfens' service will tarnish the hotel's reputation as a wedding venue, adding, "We welcome all kinds of guests.""From our point of view, these are more guests with a specific need, and we have an opportunity to help them to fill that need," Sgarlata said. "We don't see it as different from any of our other groups."Since weddings will likely be held at the same time as some of the divorce negotiations, Sgarlata said the hotel will keep the milestones separate."We would be sensitive to having them in different parts of the hotel," he said.

At a Tampa film festival in 2014, a conservationist for Google said something that struck young Florida documentary filmmaker and digital designer Derek Alan Rowe. During a presentation on Google Earth's underwater street view feature, he said something along the lines of, "If I can get someone's head underwater, I can get them under the ocean."In other words, the way to get people engaged in the world around them is to first get them interacting with it.After some reflection on that idea, Rowe decided to use his background in technology and film to "set a new bar for conservation media." He made the move from Orlando to Durham, identifying with the city's growing tech scene. And now he's on his way toward setting that bar with WildEyes , a project aimed to bring all of the U.S. National Parks to life in virtual reality.The project launched last fall after Rowe raised $9,001 through an Indiegogo campaign. The funds went toward park and travel expenses and 360-degree camera equipment.Also helping jumpstart the project is Doctrine Creative , a small creative production company in Orlando that Rowe runs with three co-founders.To Rowe, the demo showed that WildEyes works in classrooms and should be in the hands of students everywhere.A new partnership should make this goal possible.WildEyes just became a content provider for Google Expeditions , a free application teachers can use to take their students on virtual reality field trips anywhere in the world—from the ocean depths to outer space.Google Expeditions will release WildEyes content to the app on the National Park Service's 100-year anniversary, August 25.In light of WildEyes' success, Rowe has not lost sight of his mission to create content that stays true to the park experience, that "breaks down what's inspiring about the natural world," he says.Nate Hoffmeier, assistant organizer of Research Triangle Park's virtual reality network, WildEyes is among a new crop of virtual reality startups that are reimagining existing technology to better industries such as education, medicine, therapy and even architecture, says, assistant organizer of Research Triangle Park's virtual reality network, RTPVRwas formed earlier this year by Vive , which is part of major smartphone brand HTC. It consists of top technology venture capital firms such as Sequoia Capital and Redpoint Ventures . With a $10 billion bankroll, the alliance meets every month in Beijing and San Francisco to hear pitches from virtual reality startups. And they're attracting the attention of venture capitalists. The Virtual Reality Venture Capital AllianceBut since the industry is so fresh, there's little competition between startups in the virtual reality space. This allows for room to collaborate on ways to build sustainable business models, with or without venture capital support, Hoffmeier says.Though it's part of an industry that hasn't yet seen massive success or massive failure, WildEyes has an edge, Hoffmeier believes.It uses virtual reality to "share these beautiful experiences with kids who might not have exposure to these places," and serves as an educator in the industry."WildEyes is hoping to increase awareness of our natural parks and introduce people to the concept of going outside and enjoying nature," he adds.Existing within a budding tech industry that's full of never-before-seen innovation, WildEyes stays in touch with something intangible and everlasting.It's harnessing new technologies as mediums to connect people of all ages to the universally primitive act of appreciating nature.
The Pennsylvania Railroad Harsimus Branch Embankment, a massive sectional retaining wall that traverses six residential blocks between Fifth and Sixth Streets, is one of the few intact relics of the legendary Pennsylvania Road-arguable the largest, wealthiest, and most influential of several railroad companies that occupied Jersey City's landscape for nearly 150 years.Designed by James J. Ferris, a prominent civil engineer and politician in Jersey City for whom a local high school is named (Ferris also supervised the piling and pouring of the Powerhouse's vast concrete foundation), the Embankment was erected form 1901-1905 to replace an older iron and timer embankment that was deemed too low and unstable.The Pennsylvania Railroad commissioned Ferris to design the elevated freight line on Sixth Avenue to bring seven railway lines through downtown Jersey City to Harsimus yard on the Hudson River. According to local historian John Gomez, ". . . Ferris made a conscious, successful attempt at integrating the massive structure into the surrounding residential streetscapes with as much elegance and beauty as one can give a stone bridge. The colossal granite and sandstone embankment soared segmentally - block by block, connected by steel bridges - past tenement windows, stables, warehouses and places of worship. Christened the Pennsylvania Railroad Stem Embankment, it stands as Ferris's engineering masterwork - and it turns out, his only surviving span."Residents of the quiet historic neighborhoods of Harsimus Cove and Hamilton Park, perfectly separated by the Embankment, had to adjust to this powerful structure. Around-the-clock steam locomotives carrying produce and live cattle cargo emerged westerly from the Pennsylvania Railroad Cut, traveled past tenement windows atop the 7-track Embankment, and led directly to the Harsimus Cove freight yards and waterfront wharves. Constructed of enormous sandstone and granite blocks, the Embankment reaches a breathtaking height of 27 feet at its western terminus near Brunswick Street. Each block-long section is 400 feet long and 100 feet wide. Gigantic plate girder bridges connected each segment but were dismantled in 1996 by Conrail and sold for scrap. Although no longer utilized, the Embankment is recognized as an engineering monument and was entered into the State Register of Historic Places in 1999.Reference:Gomez, John. "End of the Line?"

Marc KasowitzWashington: President Donald Trump has tapped a longtime legal adviser to serve as his private attorney while a special counsel investigates whether his campaign worked with Russia in last year's election, a source familiar with the decision said on Tuesday.Fox Business News and ABC first reported that Trump hired Marc Kasowitz, a New York-based trial lawyer known as a tenacious litigator, to represent him in a Justice Department investigation headed by former Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Robert Mueller.The appointment of a private attorney may indicate that Trump is seriously considering the impact the federal investigation could have on him personally and that he may wish to protect himself should others in his administration turn against him.The source said Kasowitz is expected to bring other lawyers on to work as a team to protect Trump.Other candidates for the job, including Brendan Sullivan and Robert Giuffra, withdrew their names from consideration, the source said."He can be aggressive — he's got that in him for sure," said John Quinn of Quinn Emanuel Urquhart and Sullivan, who has worked with and opposite Kasowitz. "He also can be smooth as silk, respectful and deferential." Kasowitz and the White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters.Kasowitz has represented Trump for more than 15 years but he is not known as a criminal defence lawyer. During last year's presidential campaign, Kasowitz threatened to sue the New York Times if it did not retract a story about women who accused Trump of touching them inappropriately. The Times did not retract the story.He also assisted in the defence of fraud claims against Trump University, a series of real-estate seminars. After the election, Trump settled the claims for $25 million.Trump has looked to Kasowitz's firm to fill positions in his administration. He has described former Senator Joseph Lieberman, a senior counsel at the firm, as a top candidate to serve as FBI director and is considering Edward McNally, a white-collar defence lawyer at the firm, as the next US attorney in Manhattan. A former partner at the firm, David Friedman, was chosen by Trump as US ambassador to Israel.Kasowitz also represents OJSC Sberbank of Russia, the country's largest bank, which is being accused in a US federal court of conspiring with granite company executives and others to raid the assets of a competitor.The outside counsel would be separate from the White House Counsel's Office, led by Donald McGahn.Mueller was appointed as special counsel by the Justice Department last week to investigate the Trump campaign's possible ties to Russia. Several congressional committees and the FBI are also investigating the matter.US intelligence agencies concluded in January that Moscow tried to sway the November vote in Trump's favour. Russia has denied involvement, and Trump has denied any collusion between his campaign and Russia.Controversy has engulfed Trump since he fired FBI Director James Comey two weeks ago as Comey oversaw an investigation into possible collusion between his presidential campaign and Russia.
KIEV (Reuters) - A peace roadmap agreed last week between Ukraine and pro-Russian separatists preserves the concept of a sovereign, united country within its current borders, President Petro Poroshenko said on Wednesday.Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko speaks during his visit to the Ilich Iron and Steel Works in the coastal town of Mariupol, September 8, 2014. REUTERS/Mykola Lazarenko/Ukrainian Presidential Press Service/Handout via ReutersPoroshenko also told a televised meeting of the government that a ceasefire between government forces and the rebels in eastern Ukraine was proving difficult to maintain because "the terrorists are trying all the time to provoke" Kiev's troops."The protocol (signed in Minsk last Friday) envisages the restoration and preservation of Ukrainian sovereignty on all the territory of the Donbass (in eastern Ukraine), including that controlled by the fighters," he said.Poroshenko added that he would submit to parliament next week a draft law that would grant a special status to some areas of Donetsk and Luhansk regions, which are currently controlled by the separatists.
KIEV/SEVASTOPOL, Crimea (Reuters) - The career of Sergei Yeliseyev helps to explain why Ukraine's armed forces gave up Crimea almost without a fight - and why NATO now says it is alert to Russian attempts to undermine military loyalty in its eastern European members.His rise to become number two in the Ukrainian navy long before Russia seized Crimea illustrates the divided loyalties that some personnel in countries that once belonged to the Soviet Union might still face.Yeliseyev's roots were in Russia but he ended up serving Ukraine, a different ex-Soviet republic, only to defect when put to the test. NATO military planners now believe Moscow regards people with similarly ambiguous personal links as potentially valuable, should a new confrontation break out with the West.In 2014, Yeliseyev was first deputy commander of the Ukrainian fleet, then largely based in Crimea, when Russian soldiers in unmarked uniforms took control of Kiev's ships and military bases on the peninsula.Instead of resisting, Yeliseyev quit and subsequently got a new job: deputy chief of Russia's Baltic Fleet.Yeliseyev, now aged 55, did not respond to Reuters questions sent to him via the Russian defense ministry.In Kiev, however, there is no doubt where his loyalties lay. "When he took an oath to Ukraine, these were empty words for him. He has always been pro-Russian," said Ihor Voronchenko, now commander of the Ukrainian navy, who once served with Yeliseyev.In fact, the Russian soldiers were pushing at an open door in late February 2014 - Yeliseyev was just one of many to defect and almost all Ukrainian forces in Crimea failed to resist.Russia annexed Crimea the following month, prompting a major row with the West which deepened over Moscow's role in a rebellion in eastern Ukraine that lasts to this day.At the time, Moscow and its allies in Crimea exploited weaknesses within Kiev's military to undermine its ability to put up a fight, according to interviews conducted by Reuters with about a dozen people on both sides of the conflict.The Russian defense ministry did not respond to questions on their accounts of the events in 2014 submitted by Reuters.One NATO commander told Reuters that, in a re-run of the tactics it deployed in Crimea, Russian intelligence was trying to recruit ethnic Russians serving in the militaries of countries on its borders.Speaking on condition of anonymity, the commander said the alliance was particularly sensitive to the risk in countries with high concentrations of ethnic Russians, notably the Baltic states.NATO had to guard against this, said the commander, though the risk should not be overstated because having Russian roots did not necessarily mean that a person's loyalty is to Moscow.Officials in the Baltic states, former Soviet republics which unlike Ukraine are NATO members, play down the danger.Related Coverage Russia unveils plan to build another power station in Crimea: TASSNATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg likewise said he trusted the armies of the Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Still, he told Reuters: "We always have to be vigilant. We always have to develop our intelligence tools and to be able to see any attempts to try to undermine the loyalty of our forces."DROPPING THE GUARDYears before the Crimean annexation, a Ukrainian appointment panel appeared to drop its guard when it interviewed Yeliseyev for the deputy naval commander's post.Yeliseyev was born near Moscow, graduated from a Soviet naval school in the Russian city of Kaliningrad in 1983 and served with the Russian Pacific fleet.So the panel asked Yeliseyev what he would do if Russia and Ukraine went to war. He replied that he would file for early retirement, according to Myroslav Mamchak, a former Ukrainian naval captain who served with Yeliseyev. Despite this response, Yeliseyev got the job in 2006.Mamchak did not disclose to Reuters how he knew what was said in the interview room but subsequent events bear out his account.Relations between Russia and Ukraine dived as Kiev moved closer to NATO and eight years after his appointment, with the countries on the brink of conflict over Crimea, Yeliseyev stayed true to his word by quitting.Russia's actions were not the only factor in the Crimean events. Ukraine's military had suffered years of neglect, there was a power vacuum in Kiev after the government was overthrown, and many Crimean residents felt more affinity with Moscow.Still, Ukrainian service personnel with Russian ties switched sides when the annexation began and some officers pretended to put up resistance only to avoid court-martial. Moscow also intercepted orders from Kiev so they never reached the Crimean garrison."There was nothing spontaneous. Everything was organized and each fiddler played his role," said Mykh
A former assistant attorney general who refused to apologize to a gay student leader at the University of Michigan whom he defamed and harassed online and on campus must now pay him $4.5 million, a jury decided.The "Chris Armstrong Watch" blog, created by former Michigan Assistant Attorney General Andrew Shirvell, 32, accused openly gay University of Michigan ex-student body president Christopher Armstrong of enticing minors with alcohol and recruiting people to become homosexual.The U.S. District Court jury Thursday awarded a $4.5 million civil settlement to Armstrong, 22, who said he suffered distress as a result of Shirvell's actions."I'm just incredibly humbled by what happened today," Armstrong said Thursday. "This is truly a victory, not just for myself, but for a lot of other kids out there."Michigan alum Shirvell blogged that Armstrong, who graduated in 2011, was "a radical homosexual activist, racist, elitist and liar."Deborah Gordon, the attorney representing Armstrong, said Shirvell also blogged that Armstrong participated in a number of sordid activities, including engaging in sex acts on a children's playground, inside a church and that he hosted orgies.Shirvell would find out via Facebook about events Armstrong planned to attend in Ann Arbor, Mich., turn up and try to blend in with the crowd, Gordon said. He showed up at Armstrong's house several times and at one point called the police to report a party Armstrong was attending; he then blogged that "Ann Arbor police raided out of control gay party," she said.Gordon told ABC News that she did not present the jury with anything on the blog that could be considered opinion, but showed the court that what Shirvell said was provable as false. She said Shirvell did not call a single witness during the trial, but "wrapped himself in the First Amendment."Shirvell contested in court that all his statements were either true, or protected because of Armstrong's role as a public figure. He said that he plans to appeal, according to The Associated Press."This should have been thrown out," he said Thursday. "Juries give short shrift to First Amendment rights."Gordon said Shirvell was told that the lawsuit would have been dropped if he had retracted his statements. She said that because the jury that heard the case is unable to make Shirvell issue an apology, the $4.5 million in damages would take its place."When we filed the case, we sent him a letter asking for retractions," Gordon said. "We sent a letter before the case was heard. The record needed to be set straight."Shirvell, who was fired by former Attorney General Mike Cox after criticism of Armstrong in 2010, said he is unemployed, and that he has no means to pay such a sizable settlement, The AP reported."There's no way I could possibly ever pay such a judgment," he said after the ruling.Shirvell, who represented himself, did not return calls from ABC News today.Gordon said Armstrong has a job that resulted from an internship he had last year. She says she will continue to represent him, but that the possibility of allowing a retraction to settle the situation has passed."The jury has spoken. He had his chance to take responsibility and make this right, and give Chris his reputation back," she said."The jury did it. I don't need any retractions, nor am I asking. Absolutely not. He can just live with that."The Associated Press contributed to this report.
Unionization more prevalent in government than private sectorOne of the biggest changes in the union movement has happened mostly under the radar, but it has big consequences for union officials, workers and the public at large. Unions used to be powerful in the private sector. But now, most union workers nationwide are government employees. It has been this way since 2009. Since...One of the biggest changes in the union movement has happened mostly under the radar, but it has big consequences for union officials, workers and the public at large.Unions used to be powerful in the private sector. But now, most union workers nationwide are government employees. It has been this way since 2009.Since 2000 unions have lost more than 2 million members in the private sector nationwide, but gained more than 200,000 members in government. Something very similar happened in Illinois, with union membership holding steady in government while membership dropped by 244,000 in the private sector.With a long history of private-sector unionism, Illinois hasn't quite reached that point yet, but the gap has narrowed to almost nothing. Government union members could outnumber private-sector union members as early as this year.With the shift to government unions has come a shift in union officials' priorities. Union bosses and lobbyists have long had sympathy for tight regulation of the economy and an activist government, but now they have a direct interest in the growth of government – that's where their members are, and that is the most likely place for them to find new members.At the same time, union officials have much less reason to worry about the state of the private economy. For government unions, an economy that fails to grow is not a pressing concern because they can press for tax increases to make up any lost income and preserve government programs that employ their own members. This is a big part of why government unions – but not private sector unions – have been major backers of the progressive tax hike push.The rise of government unions also has implications for health care. A few months ago many unions – almost all of them private-sector based groups such as the Teamsters, the Food and Commercial Workers, and the Laborers registered a number of complaints about ObamaCare. Government unions, such as the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees or the big teachers unions, however, have been much less vocal about the "Affordable Care Act." The Service Employees International Union, which represents many government employees, is one of the few unions that remains unabashedly in favor of the law. Government unions can be blasé about the imploding health-insurance marketplaces because governments are in a better position to pay whatever is needed to maintain quality insurance than almost any private employer is.Because unions now represent more government workers, they are less likely to bargain with businesses that are seeking to maximize profits and more likely to bargain with politicians who want to maximize their support. The temptation for politicians will always be to trade taxpayer money for union support.Finally, all unions have an interest in protecting their members from discipline. In the case of government, that means that unions make it harder for taxpayers to identify the people who enforce laws and run taxpayer-supported social programs, or hold government workers accountable for their actions. (Here's one example of where that can lead.) The inevitable result is a less transparent government, something that should be a concern for all of us – conservatives and liberals alike.Union expansion into government has been going on for 30 years, and this trend is unlikely to change on its own. Unions have changed themselves. Illinois citizens need to pay attention to the changes in the union establishment. The old storylines, and the old sympathies for working men and women who once battled against big corporations, no longer apply.
'In Meat We Trust' Argues We Got The Meat Industry We Asked ForEnlarge this image iStockphoto iStockphotoIn Meat We Trust An Unexpected History of Carnivore America by Maureen Ogle Hardcover, 368 pages | purchase close overlay Buy Featured Book Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How?The meat on your dinner table probably didn't come from a happy little cow that lived a wondrous life out on rolling green hills. It probably also wasn't produced by a robot animal killer hired by an evil cabal of monocle-wearing industrialists.Truth is, the meat industry is complicated, and it's impossible to understand without a whole lot of context. That's where Maureen Ogle comes in. She's a historian and the author of In Meat We Trust: An Unexpected History of Carnivore America.Ogle's book examines the pipeline that meat takes today from field to table by trying to understand its roots. She starts all the way back in Colonial America, when settlers found so much available land that they were able to raise livestock they could never have afforded in Europe. Meat, Ogle writes, became a status symbol in early America.Much has been made of the ugly details of the modern meat industry, from Upton Sinclair's The Jungle to Michael Pollan's Omnivore's Dilemma to various exposes and articles on slaughterhouses. The industry's roots, though, stretch back more than a century, when Americans left their farms for the big cities, leaving a vast urban population with a cash income and a hankering for meat."As more people moved to cities, the gap between the amount of livestock and meat that could be produced constantly lagged the demand on the part of consumers," Ogle told me in a recent interview.Ogle ties the rise of gigantic meat companies and industrial meatpacking facilities not to post-World War II subsidies and corporate takeovers, but to the rise of cities. Those urbanites wanted meat — and they wanted it cheap."As a result, farmers, and urban voters, and the USDA and politicians all agreed that farming in the United States needed to be much more efficient and needed to run more like a factory than what many people think a farm should be like," Ogle says. All "in order to reduce farmers' production costs and, therefore, keep the cost of food down."The demand for vast quantities of meat at cheap prices led to meat producers pushing for efficiency and squeezing every bit of profit from every animal. That meant the rise of giant feedlots fattening animals on corn feed, and huge meatpackers processing animals at factory speed and scale. The industrial meat system, Ogle argues, is a supply and demand problem."As long as the demand is there, we're going to continue to have these very large industrial systems, because that's the only way to satisfy demand," Ogle says. "You're not going to satisfy demand with small farmers."It's that kind of thinking that has opened Ogle up to frequent criticism on social media since the book was published on Nov. 12. In the introduction to the book, Ogle writes, "The battles over production and consumption of meat are nearly as ferocious as those over gays, gun control and marriage." Now, Ogle is in the middle of vicious debates on the efficacy of the way meat is raised and processed. (Check the comments under recent interviews with WNYC's The Takeaway and Salon.)Ogle has been accused of being a shill for big industry and of being anti-small farmer. But the book doesn't shy away from the realities of the modern meatpacking industry and presents it in realistic detail. Ogle says she doesn't want to pick a side, but merely present a nuanced look at an important issue that has been turned into political sound bites.Ultimately, Ogle finds there is a fundamental disconnect in the way many of us view meat. We want it; we want it cheaply; we want it made in a place where we don't have to deal with the sights and sounds of slaughtering animals; and we don't want it to come from factory farms. Something, Ogle says, has to give.
Ecosystem protection payments pay off Trees take up a lot of CO 2 , so one approach to reducing the rate of increase in atmospheric CO 2 levels is to reduce the cutting down of trees. Jayachandran et al. evaluated a program in which forest owners in Uganda were paid to not cut down their trees. Encouragingly, payments did reduce deforestation, and owners did not compensate by cutting down trees in neighboring forests. Furthermore, even in a scenario where cutting resumed after payments ceased, the beneficial delay in CO 2 release from cut trees, as quantified by the social cost of carbon, outweighed the monetary cost. Science, this issue p. 267Abstract We evaluated a program of payments for ecosystem services in Uganda that offered forest-owning households annual payments of 70,000 Ugandan shillings per hectare if they conserved their forest. The program was implemented as a randomized controlled trial in 121 villages, 60 of which received the program for 2 years. The primary outcome was the change in land area covered by trees, measured by classifying high-resolution satellite imagery. We found that tree cover declined by 4.2% during the study period in treatment villages, compared to 9.1% in control villages. We found no evidence that enrollees shifted their deforestation to nearby land. We valued the delayed carbon dioxide emissions and found that this program benefit is 2.4 times as large as the program costs.Land-use change—mostly deforestation—was responsible for 9% of global anthropogenic carbon emissions between 2006 and 2015, making it the second largest source of carbon emissions after fossil fuel combustion (1). Trees absorb carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) through photosynthesis and store the carbon in their biomass. When a tree is cut down, it stops absorbing CO 2 , and, as it decomposes or is burned, its store of carbon is released into the atmosphere.Curbing deforestation in low-income countries, where most deforestation occurs today, is viewed as one of the most cost-effective ways to reduce global CO 2 emissions (2, 3). The reasoning is that the cost to intensify agriculture and adopt nonwood fuels and construction material in poor countries to meet growing consumption needs without clearing forests is much lower than the cost of many of the technological changes in high-income countries that reduce emissions by the same amount. Thus, having rich countries finance forest conservation projects in poor countries is a promising way to address climate change.Indeed, the United Nations' REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) mechanism was created to financially reward developing countries for preservation of forests. The Paris Agreement negotiated in 2015 bolstered the role of REDD+ in international climate policy (4, 5). To put REDD+ into action, one needs to identify effective on-the-ground interventions that reduce deforestation. This Research Article evaluates a promising and popular type of intervention, namely, financial incentives for forest owners to keep their forest intact. This type of policy is called Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES): Payments are made conditional on voluntary proenvironment behaviors (6–8). PES is the environmental version of conditional cash transfers, a policy instrument used widely in developing countries to incentivize families to invest in child health and education.Despite the widespread use and growing popularity of PES, its effectiveness and cost-effectiveness are open questions. One key concern is what the PES community calls "additionality" and economists refer to as "inframarginality": Absent the payments, some participants would have engaged in the incentivized behavior anyway. If such individuals represent many of the enrollees, then the program will generate very little gain in forest cover per dollar spent. A second concern is that individuals will simply shift their tree-cutting from land covered by the PES contract to other nearby land ("leakage").This study was a randomized evaluation of a PES intervention that was implemented in order to measure the causal impacts on forest cover. The PES program offered private owners of forest in western Uganda payments if they refrained from clearing trees. The program was designed and implemented by a local conservation nonprofit, Chimpanzee Sanctuary and Wildlife Conservation Trust (CSWCT) (9). The study was carried out in 121 villages with private forest owners (PFOs); we randomly selected 60 of the villages to be in the treatment group. In treatment villages, the PES program was marketed to PFOs, and they were eligible to enroll. To participate, PFOs had to enroll all of their primary forest (10). During the 2-year program from 2011 to 2013, enrollees who complied with the contract received 70,000 Ugandan shillings (UGX), or $28 in 2012 U.S. dollars, per hectare of forest per year, paid out in cash at the end of each year. CSWCT employed forest monitors who conducted spot checks of enrollees' land to check for recent tree-clearing. The program also offered additional payments in exchange
Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker is fond of pointing out that he was voted into office based on his promise to take on state employee union collective bargaining rights so that he could get on with balancing the state's budget.Indeed, shortly after introducing his controversial 'beat down' of collective bargaining in the Badger State, Walker claimed that nobody should have been surprised by his actions because he had campaigned on the issue.We introduced a measure last week, a measure I ran on during the campaign, a measure I talked about in November during the transition, a measure I talked about in December when we fought off the employee contracts, an idea I talked about in the inauguration, an idea I talked about in the state of the state. If anyone doesn't know what's coming, they've been asleep for the past two years. Via Milwaukee Journal SentinelWhile there have been continuing efforts to show that Scott Walker never did reveal his plans for collective bargaining in the state during the campaign, definitive proof has now emerged via a video tape of Candidate Walker being interviewed by the editorial board of the Oshkosh Northwestern— just one week before the election.The smoking gun video was recently unearthed by Judd Lounsbury, and published on his Uppity Wisconsin blog, and reveals that Scott Walker was singing quite a different tune before winning his gubernatorial race. While you can watch the entire video at the Uppity Wisconsin website—and I recommend you do so—here is the relevant dialogue which takes place at 7:50 into the conversation -Editorial Board Member: Before, we were talking about state employees contributing to their plan, paying their share of the pension plan. Collective bargaining come into that? Walker: Yep (nodding yes) Editorial Board Member: How do you get that negotiated and accepted by the state employee unions? Walker: You still have to negotiate it. I did that at the county as well.Walker went on to indicate that he was willing to work with the unions, pointing out that he had used furloughs as a bargaining tool when negotiating with unions as Milwaukee County Executive and that he would "approach a similar strategy for the state." Walker further noted that he was open to compromise and that if the unions had ideas as to how to save money, he would be willing to explore what they might have to say.Sounds reasonable to me—except that it turns out that Governor Walker had no interest whatsoever in what the unions had to say. In fact, we know that the state employees' unions attempted to agree with Walker's proposals to modify their collective bargaining agreements before the Governor introduced his legislation placing severe limits on collective bargaining.So, Governor Walker fibbed. The question now is will Wisconsin voters care?While it seems difficult to ignore that Walker very much sought to mislead Wisconsin voters on a very important issue, there remains considerable support for his anti-collective bargaining position in Wisconsin. Still, polls reveal that a majority of Wisconsinites disapprove of Walker's anti-collective bargaining stance, calling into question whether or not the Governor would have emerged victorious in his race had he been more forthright with the voters of his state.Certainly, Governor Walker is not the first politician to fudge the truth during an election. There are ample examples on both sides of the political divide where dishonest campaigning is the norm.But will Wisconsin voters punish their governor for putting his state through the political turmoil that might have been avoided had he warned them of his plans? According to the most recent PPP survey, while Walker's approval numbers in his state are upside down — 52 percent voice disapproval with their controversial governor— he fares better on the question of returning him to office. His fate, however, remains a toss up with 49 percent of Wisconsinites saying he should stay and 49 percent saying he should go.Clearly, this is going to be a very interesting election and I cannot imagine a better opportunity for voters to voice the opinion that we would prefer our candidates to be honest about their plans before we elect them to office rather than surprise us after they've got the job.contact Rick at thepolicypage@gmail.comTwitter @rickungar
Officials discussed the club's future at meeting Monday, but the owner has decided to close the club by FridayCameo, location of mass shooting, to close for good by end of weekSunday's mass shooting at Cameo nightclub has Cincinnati leaders demanding answers about security at the club."We will evaluate the club and the safety and the security as we always do," Cincinnati councilwoman Yvette Simpson said during Monday's Law and Public Safety Committee meeting.Simpson's comments came approximately 36 hours after police said local men started firing guns inside Cameo nightclub, killing one man and injuring 16 people."It hurts our sense of security," Councilwoman Amy Murray said. "Cincinnati is a safe place, and it hurts our sense of security."Murray asked Cincinnati Police Chief Eliot Isaac about safety measures at bars and nightclubs."Who's required to have a metal detector for people to go into a bar?" Murray asked. "Is it a requirement? Who's required to have it?"Isaac said there's no mandate bar owners have to follow, but he said establishments like Cameo often work with police to devise safety protocols. That's why the club on Kellogg Avenue has a metal detector."I know that (Cincinnati Police) District Two has worked with this particular bar owner around several things," Isaac said. "And I believe that was one of the safety strategies that they've implemented."Councilman Charlie Winburn said the city should consider asking all bars and clubs that serve alcohol to create safety plans."I think we may want to establish a best practice, if we don't already have them, for bars that we would sign off on safety, that here's what every bar must have," Winburn said.In addition to questions about security, council members brought up Cameo's liquor license."We've made decisions to remove liquor licenses," Simpson said. "We've made decisions to redevelop safety plans and allow places to stay open."In Cameo's case, that step proved unnecessary. The club's owner voluntarily surrendered the club's liquor license on Monday afternoon.Hours later, the owner announced the club would close its doors for good on Friday.Rodgers said he received a notice to vacate the premises from the landlord and owner of the property.In a letter, Rodgers notified the owner that although he had planned to move out in May due to the landlord's planned sale of the property, he will instead voluntarily surrender the property immediately.AlertMe

Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland says Ottawa will forge its own path on the world stage because Canada can no longer rely on Washington for global leadership.In a major speech setting the stage for Wednesday's release of a new multibillion-dollar blueprint for the Canadian Armed Forces, Ms. Freeland rejected Donald Trump's "America First" foreign policy and its dismissal of free trade, global warming and the value of Western alliances in countering Russian adventurism and the Islamic State.While she did not mention the U.S. President by name, Ms. Freeland expressed deep concern about the desire of many American voters to "shrug off the burden of world leadership."Story continues below advertisementJohn Ibbitson: Trudeau decides it's just not worth appeasing Trump in foreign-policy shiftOpinion: Chrystia Freeland must turn vision into realityOpinion: Freeland has woken up to reality. Has Trudeau?"The fact that our friend and ally has come to question the very worth of its mantle of global leadership puts in sharper focus the need for the rest of us to set our own clear and sovereign course," she told the House of Commons on Tuesday. "To say this is not controversial: It is a fact."The Liberal government's decision to publicly question U.S. leadership echoes criticism last week by German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who said Europe has to take on a larger role on the global stage as Washington was no longer a reliable partner. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke by phone with Ms. Merkel on Tuesday and they reaffirmed their commitment to the Paris climate treaty and to multilateralism.Ms. Freeland said Canada has been able to count on the powerful U.S. military to provide a protective shield since the end of the Second World War, but the United States' turn inwards requires a new Canadian approach to defend liberal democracies."To rely solely on the U.S. security umbrella would make us a client state," she said. "To put it plainly: Canadian diplomacy and development sometimes require the backing of hard power."Story continues below advertisementStory continues below advertisementGiving Canada's military "hard power" will allow it to meet global challenges, she said, listing North Korea, the civil war in Syria, the Islamic State, Russian aggression in the Ukraine and Baltic states and climate change as major threats to the world order."We will make the necessary investments in our military, to not only address years of neglect and underfunding, but also to place the Canadian Armed Forces on a new footing – with new equipment, training, resources and consistent and predictable funding," she said.Wednesday's defence-policy review is expected to lay out the military's priorities for future overseas deployments, and outline Ottawa's 20-year plan for spending billions of dollars to upgrade warships and fighter jets, among other things.Ms. Freeland said Canada will step up militarily and diplomatically to boost its international voice while, at the same time, urging the United States to recognize the important role its plays in fostering peace as the world's biggest military and economic power."We seek and will continue to seek to persuade our friends that their continued international leadership is very much in their national interest – as well as that of the rest of the world," she said.Ms. Freeland, who has emerged as one of Mr. Trudeau's more capable cabinet ministers, expressed the Liberal government's disappointment with Mr. Trump's decision to pull out of the Paris climate treaty, calling on the world to show "renewed, uncommon resolve" to combat climate change. Mr. Trump campaigned as a global-warming denier, calling it a hoax.Story continues below advertisement"Turning aside from our responsibilities is not an option. Instead we must think carefully and deeply about what is happening, and find a way forward," she told MPs.Ms. Freeland also championed the benefits of free trade, now under challenge with the rise of U.S. protectionism led by the Trump White House. Free trade isn't responsible for the gap between the rich and poor in developed nations of the world, she said."International trade is the wrong target," she said. "The real culprit is domestic policy that fails to appreciate that continued growth, and political stability, depend on domestic measures that share the wealth."Outside the Commons, Ms. Freeland sidestepped questions about the wisdom of taking indirect potshots at Mr. Trump – who issued an angry tweet against Ms. Merkel last week."I was careful to only refer to Canadian sources and Canadian examples," she told reporters. "This is about us standing on our own two feet, having a foreign policy that expresses as an independent and sovereign country what we need to achieve in the world."Conservative foreign-policy critic Peter Kent said Ms. Fre
Acquiring the Reflectance Field of a Human Face Paul Debevec, Tim Hawkins, Chris Tchou, Haarm-Pieter Duiker, Westley Sarokin, and Mark Sagar SIGGRAPH 2000 Conference Proceedings Updated 4/10/04 Abstract:We present a method to acquire the reflectance field of a human face and use these measurements to render the face under arbitrary changes in lighting and viewpoint. We first acquire images of the face from a small set of viewpoints under a dense sampling of incident illumination directions using a light stage. We then construct a reflectance function image for each observed image pixel from its values over the space of illumination directions. From the reflectance functions, we can directly generate images of the face from the original viewpoints in any form of sampled or computed illumination. To change the viewpoint, we use a model of skin reflectance to estimate the appearance of the reflectance functions for novel viewpoints. We demonstrate the technique with synthetic renderings of a person's face under novel illumination and viewpoints.The PaperSIGGRAPH 2000 Conference Proceedings The MovieSIGGRAPH 2000 Electronic Theater The DemoSIGGRAPH 2000 Creative Applications Laboratory debevec-siggraph2000-high.pdf (3.6MB)320x240 QuickTime (19.6MB)640x480 DivX (148MB)Facial Reflectance Field Demo SIGGRAPH 2000 PowerPoint Slides15.4MB SIGGRAPH 2000 Papers Video (Divx)54MB The Light Stage. The primary apparatus used in our work is the Light Stage. Version 1.0 of the Light Stage is designed to move a small spotlight around a person's head (or a small collection of objects) so that it is illuminated from all possible directions in a small period of time. From this data, we can then simulate the object's appearance under any complex lighting condition. A set of stationary digital video cameras record the person or objects' appearance as the light moves around, and for some of our models we precede the lighting run with a geometry capture process using structured light from a video projector. Light Stage 1.0 consists of a wooden superstructure and a two-bar mechanism made of ABS plastic tubing to rotate the light in azimuth (theta) and inclination (phi). The primary theta axis is is attached to the superstructure at the top using two lazy Susan bearings which form an axle. The 300' power cord to the light is wound around this axle which allows the theta axis to be spun by pulling the cord. The axle triggers an electronic beep each revolution, which is recorded by the digital video cameras and is later used to register the light source directions. The phi axis bar is lowered manually by a marked string (actually a ball-chain) which runs through the axle and attaches to the phi bar near the light. The phi operator lowers the axis 180/32 or or 180/64 degrees per theta revolution. The lighting process takes approximately 80 seconds to record a 64x32 sampling of lighting directions. The materials to build the rig were bought in 10 successive trips to Home Depot for a total of $1,000. Light Stage 1.0 was operational from December 1999 to January 2000 in generously loaned space from Professor Shawn Brixey of the UC Berkeley Art Practice Department. Light Stage 1.0 Chris Tchou adjusts the video projector unit used for structured lighting, which is on wheels so that it can be moved to three locations and then removed during a capture session. H.P. Duiker sets up one of the two Sony VX1000 mini-DV cameras used for reflectance capture. Tim Hawkins marks off lengths on the phi-axis ball-chain at the top of the Light Stage. Just left of him are the theta axle and power cord, currently in need of re-winding. H.P. sits in the rig before a capture session, while Tim and Chris take the reins of the theta and phi axes. The theta-cord is now wound. A 1-minute-exposure photograph of a reflectance field capture session; the path of the spotlight is traced out as a spiraling luminous streak. A photograph of a set of objects being captured; the exposure lasted for three theta revolutions of the 64-revolution capture session. While the rig runs, the cameras record an image of the person under every possible direction of illumination. We can recombine this set of images to generate a rendering of what the person would look like under any complex form of illumination - where light comes from every direction with different colors. Most importantly, this includes illumination that we have sampled from the real world using the light probe lighting capture technique. Below are five images of a subject's face illuminated with light from different environments: The environments are, left to right, St. Peter's Basilica, the UC Berkeley Eucalyptus Grove, The U
The record heat that is baking Alaska is poised to smash a host of climate records in 2016, including the earliest snowmelt date at NOAA's Barrow Observatory, the northernmost point in the nation.Staff at the observatory reported snowmelt occurred May 13, the earliest snowmelt date in 73 years of record-keeping, beating the previous mark set in 2002 by a full 10 days.The early melting follows a record-setting winter that saw temperatures average more than 11 degrees above normal for the 49th State, shattering the previous record set in 2015. At 320 miles north of the Arctic Circle, Barrow is usually one of the last places in the United States to lose snow cover.Baked Alaska Download ImageSnow is not the only thing that's vanishing. Preliminary data from the National Snow and Ice Data Center indicate 2016 will set the record for minimum winter sea-ice extentoffsite link, eclipsing the 2015 mark. Satellite photos from mid-May depict an early sea-ice breakup with an ominous series of openings, known as leads, extending deep into the Arctic.Animation: Arctic ice on the move Download ImageDavid Douglas, research biologist with the U.S. Geological Survey, said this spring's conditions illustrate how fragile and dynamic pack ice has become. "It looks like late June or early July right now," he said. "Polar bears are having to make their decisions about how to move and where to go on thinner ice pack that's mostly first-year ice." Walrus could also face a tough summer, he said.For 40 years, wildlife biologist George Divoky has studied another Arctic species, the black guillemot, marking the start of egg-laying season for the fish-eating seabird on nearby Cooper Island. Guillemots generally lay their first eggs 10 days after snow-out in Barrow. Divoky, director of the nonprofit Friends of Cooper Island research institute, predicts a record early start to the season this year.Early ice-out is a double-edged sword for guillemots, he said. The birds do well during the early part of the season, but when the ice pulls off shore, it takes the birds' forage fish with it, reducing chick survival.Intense spring heat also perturbs a host of biological and chemical cycles, from tundra green-up and wildlife breeding seasons, to fluctuations of atmospheric gases like methane and carbon dioxide. For scientists, climate change presents an unending — if disconcerting — series of research opportunities."It's like a train wreck you can't look away from," Divoky said. "You never know what you're going to see and this year's as big a mystery as any."

In 1996, Cyberflix Incorporated decided that PC gamers would like the opportunity to look around a virtual recreation of the ship. CD-ROM technology was new and exciting and many companies took advantage of the format to store large multimedia files that would have been impossible to store on the outdated magnetic media that came before. While looking around the doomed ship and talking to its crew and passengers is fun and even educational, Titanic: Adventure Out of Time also gives you the opportunity to play a whole adventure game based around the luxury liner and it's ill fated maiden voyage. Perhaps you can go back in time and change the fate of the ship, saving lives and thus preventing James Cameron from ever making the Titanic movie? Surely that has to be worth a shot? (Yes we were kidding, we love the adventures of Jack and Rose really).InstallationTitanic uses a 16 bit installation program, meaning that it won't install on 64 bit versions of Windows at all. To help with this problem, we've prepared a replacement installer that will copy over the required files from the CD-ROM. The installer will also set up the required registry keys, install the very latest patches and configure the game for optimal settings. Since the games configuration utility is 16 bit only too, there is no way to change these options other than manually setting some registry keys, which our installer takes care of.32 bit Windows users can use the installer on the CD, but may still prefer to use our updated installer since the original installer seems to want to overwrite various DirectX files that shouldn't normally be tampered with.You can download the replacement installer here (link broken? Let me know here). Note that there are several versions of Titanic: Adventure Out of Time. If the installer does not work for your version, please leave a comment and let us know, leaving as much detail about your copy of the game as you can.Playing the gameOn many systems, the game should now run and play correctly. Titanic is a very old game however and before you sink any time into playing it you should check that everything is running correctly.

Updated 8 December 2009Amanda BiggsSocial Policy SectionContentsIntroductionCiting long waiting lists for public dental services and financial barriers to timely dental care, the National Health and Hospitals Reform Commission (NHHRC) proposes the establishment of the Denticare Australia scheme, to provide a 'universal scheme for access to basic dental services' in its final report to government.[1] Supplementing this, the NHHRC also proposes an expansion of existing state-based school dental programs, more funding for oral health promotion and an internship scheme for dental graduates. The Denticare scheme and related dental health proposals, were first suggested in the NHHRC's interim report. These remain essentially unchanged in its final report.[2]The Denticare scheme was one of the 'most welcomed' of all the reform proposals contained in the Commission's interim report, issued in November 2008.[3] Nevertheless, the response to the Denticare proposal has not been universally positive. Issues that were raised in the wake of the interim report, such as the cost of the scheme, access for disadvantaged groups, and the capacity of the dental workforce, continue to be of concern.[4]This Background Note provides an outline of the proposed Denticare scheme, including the dental services to be covered, cost estimates and financing arrangements. Responses to the proposal and some key issues for further discussion are highlighted.What is Denticare Australia?The final report recommends, among other dental and oral health proposals, the establishment of Denticare Australia, through which all Australians would have access to a 'basic package' of dental services. These dental services would be provided through either the public or private sector and be funded by Denticare Australia at no or at subsidised cost to users.The basic package of dental services would include preventive work (such as scaling and cleaning of teeth), diagnostic (x-rays), extractions and restorative work (such as fillings of cavities) as well as the provision of dentures. People could choose to have the basic package of dental services provided through a private dental plan or under public dental arrangements.Full details of what services would be covered are not provided in the report, but it makes clear that certain 'additional' services such as orthodontics would not be included under the basic package. Individuals wanting additional dental services, the NHHRC suggests, would have the option of purchasing additional health insurance products.[5] Purchasing dental services directly, that is, without buying insurance, is not an option canvassed in the final report.These proposed arrangements are outlined below.Those who choose the private option would purchase a health plan from a private health insurer to cover a 'basic package' of dental services. Denticare Australia would pay the premium for these plans, which would meet approximately 85 per cent of private dental costs; representing a significant discount.[6] The remaining costs would be paid by consumers although these co-payment amounts are expected to be lower than currently applies.[7] Consumers would then access basic dental services through a private dentist where most of their dentist's fees would be met by the private health plan.The interim report proposed that the premium paid by Denticare Australia to private health insurers, be 'risk adjusted'.[8] This would mean that a person assessed with a higher dental risk would pay a higher premium than someone assessed as having a lower dental risk. However, this proposal is not repeated in the final report, leaving open the question of what sort of premiums would apply..Those who decline the private health plan option would have access to basic dental services free of charge through state-based public dental services. These services would receive expanded funding from Denticare Australia, although the level of this expanded funding is not detailed in the final report. Those accessing public dental services may still face delays for treatment, but the NHHRC expects waiting times to be less than is currently the case.Access to public dental services would not attract a co-payment, even where services are contracted out to private dentists. Nor would public dental services only be restricted to those on concession cards as is currently the case.[9] Anyone opting not to purchase a private dental plan could access public dental services. However, it is not clear how someone who had already purchased a private plan, but who then elects to be treated in a public dental clinic, would be prevented from doing so.The final report notes that some specialised services such as those provided to people with an intellectual disability may only be available through public dental clinics.[10]The final report estimates that the cost of the Denticare scheme including the related dental proposals, would be around $5.5 billion annually (this costing includes funding for the proposed dental internship program, expansion of the school dental program and the oral health promotion program). Of this amount, the NHHRC proposes that the government allocation would be $

Think Progress has really been all over the Florida voter purge story, finally driving the kind of attention to the issue that it deserves. It's really a case of a political party trying to steal an election in plain sight. When you see the head of the Florida Republican Party admit on national television that the purge is based on flawed data, but also that it must continue, you know that the ulterior motives are clear.As mentioned, Think Progress' coverage has led to news outlets finally paying attention to what's happening in Florida, including Ari Berman at Rolling Stone. And at least one elections supervisor, in Palm Beach County, has rejected the voter purge list citing the high error rates associates with their generation, and will not be sending out notices to voters that their rights can be taken away if they don't prove their citizenship within 30 days. According to the supervisor, the purge lists are "not credible."Amidst all this, voting rights activists surveying the scene in Florida got some additional good news. A federal judge today blocked a separate Florida voter suppression law, which is designed to make voter registration drives more difficult.A federal judge blocked enforcement of key provisions of a restrictive voting law in Florida today, a breakthrough victory for Florida voters and voting rights advocates nationwide. The law, H.B. 1355, included onerous restrictions on community-based voter registration drives, forcing the League of Women Voters of Florida and other groups to shut down their drives. In his decision, U.S. District Judge Robert Hinkle found that the Constitution and federal law prohibit most of Florida's recently-passed restrictions, and highlighted the law's impact on the Plaintiffs' constitutional rights. "Together speech and voting are constitutional rights of special significance; they are the rights most protective of all others, joined in this respect by the ability to vindicate one's rights in a federal court. … [W]hen a plaintiff loses an opportunity to register a voter, the opportunity is gone forever," U.S. Judge Robert L. Hinkle wrote in his opinion blocking most of the Florida law. "And allowing responsible organizations to conduct voter-registration drives—thus making it easier for citizens to register and vote—promotes democracy."Florida passed the law in order to crack down on voter fraud, a virtually non-existent practice.This ruling will have no bearing on the voter purge, though it does show the lengths to which Rick Scott and Florida Republicans are willing to go to guarantee an election for their side. As for the voter purge, activists will continue to track the efforts throughout the state.
"Leader McCarthy has committed the classic Washington gaffe of saying something everyone knows is true," White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters.ADVERTISEMENTMcCarthy's comments drew the ire of Democrats, who said they were proof the House's Benghazi probe is a partisan attempt to attack a Democratic front-runner during the presidential campaign."Everybody thought Hillary Clinton was unbeatable, right? But we put together a Benghazi special committee, a select committee," he said on Fox News's "Hannity" Tuesday night. "What are her numbers today? Her numbers are dropping. Why? Because she's untrustable."McCarthy is considered the likely successor to Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), who is stepping down at the end of next month.Both Boehner and House Benghazi Select Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) have gone to great lengths to insist the Benghazi investigation is nonpartisan.
Preview | RecapMavericks-Trail Blazers PreviewBy NICOLINO DIBENEDETTOPosted Mar 05 2015 3:03AMLaMarcus Aldridge and the Portland Trail Blazers are rolling, but that wasn't the case against the Dallas Mavericks last month.Aldridge and the Trail Blazers will try to avenge that defeat with their fifth straight win Thursday night against the Mavericks, who may have Chandler Parsons and Tyson Chandler back.Portland (40-19) is averaging 108.5 points during a four-game winning streak, and Aldridge is chipping in with 28.0 and 13.3 rebounds in the last three.The All-Star forward was impressive again Wednesday, scoring 29 points while Nicolas Batum added 20 with eight assists to help Portland rally for a 98-93 overtime win against the Los Angeles Clippers.The Trail Blazers weren't as fortunate at Dallas on Feb. 7, blowing an 11-point lead in the final two minutes of regulation and getting outscored 15-5 in overtime of a 111-101 loss. Aldridge had 25 points and 14 rebounds and Damian Lillard scored 26 but missed 12 of 19 from the field.Batum also struggled in that defeat, missing all eight of his shots and finishing with two points and 10 boards.Lillard is looking for a bounce-back effort against the Mavericks (40-22) after he missed 12 of 13 attempts, including all seven from 3-point range, to finish with a season-low five points Wednesday. Lillard, who had a carer-high 18 rebounds, totaled 60 points on 50.0 percent shooting over the previous two games."The most important thing was that we played the type of basketball we needed to down the stretch to win the game, and I still found a way to impact the game," Lillard said.The Blazers are atop the Northwest Division, percentage points ahead of Houston for the third seed in the Western Conference. Expanding that lead may be difficult as they've dropped five of seven meetings with Dallas, which could be getting Parsons (ankle) and Chandler (hip) back from injury. Parsons has missed five games and Chandler three and both are with the team at the start of this three-game trip.Parsons is third on the team with 15.4 points per game, while Chandler ranks among the NBA leaders with 11.7 rebounds.They were essential to last month's win over Portland. Parsons had 20 points, nine boards and three steals and Chandler added 11 points and 13 rebounds.Dallas overcame their absences Monday, avoiding a three-game slide as six players scored in double digits to beat New Orleans 102-93."That's why it is a team," coach Rick Carlisle said. "We're a strength-in-numbers type of team."Having a productive Rajon Rondo at the point also helps. The guard had 19 points on 9-of-15 shooting in his best performance since being suspended one game following a heated exchange of words with Carlisle during a 99-92 win over Toronto on Feb. 24."He's done a great job," Carlisle said. "Again, he's learning what it takes to play with our players and vice versa. We're on a path where we're going to figure it out."He's looking to be aggressive. He's looking to make aggressive paint and rim attacks, and when he can finish it's great and when he draws one or two guys, he can find the right guy. That's where his special ability is."Rondo missed the last matchup with Portland due to an Achilles injury.Copyright 2015 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.

One day the world will wake up and give the correct amount of attention to what religious leaders have to say. While this dream doesn't come true it is cause for celebration when one of them publishes something that does not occur just inside of their own head.This Thursday his holiness the Pope issued a memo to all his VPs (AKA bishops) containing his thoughts on the problem of global warming. Instead of blaming us humans in it for pissing off God — which in turn would force Him to punish us with more and more waves of heat—, Pope Francis took the sensible road and said it as it is:"Humanity is called to take conscience of the necessity of changes in lifestyles, of production and of consumption, to combat this [global] warming, or at least the human causes that produce it or accelerate it."For the first time since I started trying to ignore what popes say on press releases one statement has caught my attention. Of course Pope Francis had already expressed positive views on gay acceptance, the fight on poverty and football — which are all problems worth discussing —, but never in a way that was this official.The Pope's views in a document like the encyclical function as the Catholic Church's positioning on the subject. He's the CEO, after all. Now during masses priest can talk (openly) about our individual contribution towards the Apocalypse, which can be effective in a large scale. Recycling and using renewable energy might become gateways to heaven too."The earth, our home, is beginning to look more and more like an immense pile of filth." — Pope FrancisAnother good thing about the encyclical is that it opened the door so other denominations could also make their position on global warming clear. Imam Mohamed Magid of the Islamic Society of North America, for example, said to TIME Magazine that "people of all faiths can come together for this cause because the concept of stewardship on Earth is a shared belief." A proof, thus, that a bit of sensibleness can bring people of so distinct creeds together.Whatever the Pope says still resonates strongly around the world. It is more effective in all senses, then, to talk about real issues than about the deathly sin that is the use of contraceptive methods. Religion should be a comforting and educating experience, not a constant struggle to revalidate beaten dogmas. This man Jorge Mario seems wise enough to understand he can only do good to people if people listen to him — so he's adapting.This Pope is pop.

California farmers now must abide by the nation's strictest rules for a widely used pesticide in a change designed to protect farmworkers and people who live and work near agricultural fields but is likely to raise prices on produce.The restrictions announced Wednesday target chloropicrin, a pesticide injected into the ground before planting crops such as strawberries, tomatoes and almond orchards. In recent years, the chemical has caused hundreds of people to suffer from irritated eyes, coughing fits and headaches, state officials said.The new regulations surpass standards required by U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.Brian Leahy, director of the California Department of Pesticide Regulation, said Tuesday that the higher standard is needed in California, the nation's leading agricultural producer and most populated state, where farms are often next to people. Costs are sure to rise for farmers, who will pass it along to consumers, but Leahy said it is worth it."It is burdensome," Leahy said. "But if we're going to use these tools, we've got to ensure that they're used as safely as possible."Under the new regulation, farmers are limited to applying the pesticide on up to 40 acres in one day, a reduction of 75 percent. It also expands the distance between fields and human activity — in some cases to double the distance. Farmers who use upgraded tarps to cover their fields while applying the pesticide can follow less stringent regulations, said officials.Farmers use about 5 million pounds of the pesticide a year, most heavily in the Central Valley counties of San Joaquin and Fresno and along the coast in Monterey, Santa Barbara, Santa Cruz and Ventura counties.The state has been talking with growers for more than a year about the new standards and will immediately begin implementing them, with full compliance required by 2016.The state documented 787 people as suffering from exposure to the pesticide drifting through the air between 2002 and 2011, according to the most recent records. In 2013, 19 people picking raspberries in Monterey County were sickened, and in 2012, 15 people in their homes and two firefighters near a Ventura County strawberry field reported irritated eyes, officials said.California farmers fear that tighter restrictions will increase the costs of their fruits and vegetables, potentially driving the market out of state or the country. Almond and grape growers use chloropicrin once every 20 to 30 years when they plant a new orchard or vineyard, but California's strawberry growers, who use it each season, may be hit hardest.California produces 88 percent of the nation's strawberry crop, supporting a $2.3 billion industry, said Carolyn O'Donnell, a spokeswoman for the California Strawberry Commission.It will cost the state's strawberry growers an estimated $20 million to buy upgraded tarps to cover their crops and comply with the standards, she said."Farmers and their families live near their farms and work in their fields and care deeply about protecting the safety of their workers, neighbors and communities," O'Donnell said.
Macquarie Mint under investigation for use of Rising Sun badge on commemorative coin; ceases promotional material using word 'Anzac'UpdatedA commercial mint in Victoria is being investigated for its use of a protected defence emblem on its 2015 Gallipoli landing centenary coin and the word 'Anzac' in advertising material.The Macquarie Mint mailed promotional material to thousands of Australian households in the lead up to Anzac Day, hoping to sell its $10 silver commemorative coin.The front of the coin is printed with the image of an armed soldier underneath a Rising Sun emblem, a symbol protected by the Department of Defence.The Rising Sun badge was worn by soldiers of the 1st and 2nd Australian Imperial Force in both World Wars and has become an integral part of the digger tradition.The department has told the ABC the badge cannot be used in full or in part without express permission from the Government, and it has no record of the Macquarie Mint asking permission to use the symbol.The Department of Veterans' Affairs has also pulled up the mint over its use of the world 'Anzac' in promotional material for the coin, which the mint has agreed to stop distributing. The word Anzac does not appear on the coin.It comes just a week after supermarket chain Woolworths sparked social media backlash for using the word Anzac and the phrase 'Fresh In Our Memories' over the images of former soldiers."As a protected mark, the Rising Sun badge may not to be renamed, cropped, manipulated or edited in any way, used in part or overlayed with another image," a defence spokesman said."It also cannot be used without the written permission of the Department of Defence."Defence is looking into this matter and as such, cannot provide any further information at this time.""Macquarie Mint does not have permission to use the word 'Anzac' for this purpose, and was contacted on 21 April 2015 regarding its use in the letter," a Department of Veterans' Affairs spokesman said.The department said it wrote to the Macquarie Mint earlier this week asking it to immediately stop using the term.It said companies are liable for up to $51,000 for using the word without permission.In a written statement, a Macquarie Mint spokesman said they would cease any future distribution of marketing material featuring the coin image and the single piece of marketing material featuring the word Anzac."I might add that Macquarie Mint has donated a share of proceeds from sales of our First World War Silver Collection to Legacy Australia over the past four years."This has helped contribute over $100,000 to help care for families of incapacitated and fallen veterans."Macquarie Mint has advertised its 2015 souvenir as the official tender of Kiribati, an island in the central Pacific.It says only 150,000 coins would be minted.Each comes with a certificate of authenticity confirming its specifications.Topics: world-war-1, community-and-society, history, defence-and-national-security, defence-forces, federal-government, vic, australiaFirst posted
RIO DE JANEIRO — They don't make as much money as their counterparts of the opposite sex. They don't receive as much TV airtime or media coverage. They don't attract as many fans to arenas or as many followers on social media.This sounds like a typical gender inequality story in American sports except for one thing: In gymnastics, the men are less popular than the women.The chasm has only widened at the Rio Olympics as the U.S. women have dominated and the U.S. men have faltered. Whereas the American women waltzed to victory in the team competition and appear poised to capture two more medals in the all-around Thursday, their male counterparts finished a distant fifth as a team and didn't sniff the medal stand in Wednesday's all-around."It's absolutely frustrating that it's not equal, but I think it's about winning," said U.S. Olympian Chris Brooks. "The women have a wonderful track record of producing champions and medals over and over again. Companies want to be involved with champions and medal winners. If we're going to complain about it, we also have to do better."While more success on an Olympic stage would certainly narrow the popularity gap for the American men, sports marketers remain unconvinced it would close altogether. They're skeptical a gold medal-winning men's gymnast could ever attract the same caliber sponsorships or endorsements past female champions have.View photos Chris Brooks competes on the horizontal bar during the men's individual all-around. (Getty) MoreBy the morning after the all-around competition at the 2012 Olympics, champion Gabby Douglas had already gained 200,000 Twitter followers and received props from the likes of Oprah Winfrey, Lil Wayne and Nicki Minaj. Douglas would later grace cereal boxes and magazine covers, make the rounds on the talk show circuit and even star in her own reality TV series.By contrast, American male gymnasts who win Olympic medals seldom become household names. Danell Leyva, the bronze medalist in the 2012 all-around competition, reportedly still lives at home with his mother and stepfather. Jonathan Horton, the top performer on the U.S. bronze-medal-winning team in 2008, told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette two years ago that he receives 10 times more recognition for appearing on the show "American Ninja Warrior" than anything related to gymnastics."The women's combination of athleticism, youthfulness and feminism seems to grant them a broader demographic appeal in America," said Bob Dorfman, executive director of San Francisco-based Baker Street Advertising."Women admire and respect them, men love watching them, boys want to date them, young girls want to be them. And with the must-see Olympics attracting a wider audience than any other sporting event outside of the Super Bowl, it easily makes these athletes household names and faces, attracting a wide array of sponsors."There are several factors that contributed to American female gymnasts overtaking their male counterparts in popularity during the 1970s.[Related: 'Brazilian boyfriend' of Simone Biles enjoys own time in Olympic spotlight]The introduction of Title IX in 1972 created more opportunities for female gymnasts at the college level and began the gradual process of cash-strapped athletic departments axing their men's programs. A new generation of female gymnasts also began appearing about that same time, younger and more petite than their predecessors.When 14-year-old Romanian gymnast Nadia Comaneci won three gold medals in 1976 and became the first female to score a perfect 10, she quickly became the darling of that Olympics. Young girls identified with Comaneci's small stature, vibrant personality and remarkable athleticism. Parents began enrolling toddlers in tumbling classes and more gymnastics clubs began popping up nationwide to satisfy the growing demand.Story Continues

byOn our BCC backlist, one of our permas asked whether the below meets the Snopes test."Die Boek van Mormon" By John M. PontiusThe account was originally posted by Pontius at his blog, but he has since taken the actual account down, although the comments remain. Therefore, I'm pasting here the account as given by Pontius:I was searching through my books in storage a few days ago and came across a first edition of the Book of Mormon in Afrikaans. I served a mission in South Africa from 1971 to 1973. It was an interesting and challenging experience. I attended the Stake Conference in Johannesburg on May 14, 1972 when the new translation of the Book of Mormon into Afrikaans (Die Boek van Mormon) was presented. It was an electric moment. People wept. Some had waited all of their lifetimes to read the Book of Mormon in Afrikaans. Many people had learned English for the sole purpose of reading this scripture. The Spirit was strong among us as we rejoiced. Remembering back more than 50 years, I can still remember Professor Felix Mynhardt [not a member of our church] as he spoke of his experience in translating that sacred book. I will retell it as best I can recall. Professor Mynhardt was invited to come to the stand and speak about his experience in translating the Book of Mormon. He recounted how he had been given a gift of languages from God from his youth. He said that he was fluent in many languages, including English, Afrikaans, Hebrew and Egyptian, as well as many others. He was presently employed as a language professor. He said he had been praying that the Lord would give him some task, some divinely important task, that would justify his having this gift of language from God. He said in about 1970 that he had visited with a group of Mormon leaders, who sought to commission him to translate the Book of Mormon from English into Afrikaans. He said that he knew of the Book of Mormon from his religions studies, and his initial reaction was that he did not want to be involved in translating it. However, that evening, as he prayed upon his knees, as was his habit, he said the Spirit of the Lord convicted him. The message was something on the order of, "You asked me for a great, divinely inspired task of translation, I sent it to you in the form of translating the Book of Mormon, and you declined." Professor Mynhardt said he could not sleep through the night because he knew that translating the Book of Mormon would get him into trouble with his university, which was owned and operated by the Dutch Reformed Church. When morning came he telephoned Elder Clark to inform him that he would begin the translation immediately. He stood at the pulpit and described the experience. He said, "I never begin translating a book at the beginning. Writing style usually changes through a book, and becomes more consistent toward the middle. Accordingly, I opened to a random place in the middle of the Book of Mormon, and began translating." He said, "I was startled by the obvious fact that the Book of Mormon was not authored in English. He said, "It became immediately apparent that what I was reading was a translation into English from some other language. The sentence structure was wrong for native English. The word choices were wrong, as were many phrases." He said, "How many times has an Englishman said or written, "And it came to pass?" We all laughed, and knew he was right, of course. He continued, "When I realized this, I knew that I had to find the original language, and translate it back into the original language, or a similar language to the original, and then proceed to translate it into Afrikaans. He listed a half-dozen languages he tried, all of which did not accommodate the strange sentence structure found in the Book of Mormon. He said, "I finally tried Egyptian, and to my complete surprise, I found that the Book of Mormon translated flawlessly into Egyptian, not modern, but ancient Egyptian. I found that some nouns were missing from Egyptian, so I added Hebrew nouns where Egyptian did not provide the word or phrase. I chose Hebrew because both languages existed in the same place anciently." "I had no idea at that time why the Book of Mormon was once written in Egyptian, but I can tell you without any doubt, that this book was at one point written entirely in Egyptian." I heard him say this over and over. Then, he said, "Imagine my utter astonishment when I turned to chapter one, verse one and began my actual translation and came to verse two, where Nephi describes that he was writing in the language of the Egyptians, with the learning of the Jews!" He said, "I knew by the second verse, that this was no ordinary book, that it was not the writings of Joseph Smith, but

Gudiya was six when she went missing from a train in Bihar. The 23-year-old was re-united with her parents in Guwahati, Assam, last week, thanks to an enthusiastic government official and Google search.Gudiya's parents say 17 years ago she was traveling with her uncle in a train from Patna to Guwahati when he got off at a station to buy something to eat and could not board it on time. Gudiya was found alone by railway officials on the train in Guwahati, but she could not tell them who she was.She sent to a children's home, where she was raised. About her life with her parents she could only remember that an uncle worked in a biscuit factory near a railway crossing in front her home in Patna.Neelakshi Sarma, an official of the Assam state child protection society, got close to Gudiya and decided to try and trace her parents. She says she even visited Patna but failed to find them.Ms Sarma then turned to the Google search. "I was searching on Google for hours. One day I got the contact number of a biscuit factory in Patna that help me to trace Gudiya's uncle and finally her parents," she said. When Gudiya went missing she could speak only Hindi; today she knows only Assamese.
A man unhappy with the fare a Deltona taxi driver was charging started beating the cabbie but the Red Cab worker pulled out a gun to defend himself, deputies said.When deputies arrived at the parking lot of the Winn Dixie at 2880 Howland Blvd. after 11:30 p.m. Wednesday, they found Bobby Calvert, 59, of Deltona bleeding "significantly" from the nose, a report shows.Calvert told deputies that he picked up Michael Staton, 39, and brought him to the grocery store. When he told Staton that the fare was $12, "Staton became agitated over the price of the fare," investigating deputies wrote in their reports.Calvert showed Staton the fare chart that showed $12 but Staton got out of the cab and walked to driver's side, opened the door and dragged Calvert out, while punching him several times in the face, deputies said.Calvert was able to reach for his firearm he had in the vehicle and pointed it at Staton because he was in fear for his safety. Staton walked away, deputies said.Staton was located at a nearby gas station. When deputies asked him to come outside so they can talk to him, Staton exited the convenience store but became uncooperative. He later kicked a deputy as they tried to secure him, reports show.Staton was charged with burglary with assault or battery and battery on a law enforcement officer.
I have nothing but sympathy for those who are outraged when people promise to do one thing and then do something completely different. Take Donald Trump, for example.Since becoming president-elect, the Donald has averred or outright reneged on his pledges to prosecute Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham Clinton2016 pollsters erred by not weighing education on state level, says political analyst Could President Trump's talk of a 'red wave' cause his supporters to stay home in midterms? Dem group targets Trump in M voter registration campaign: report MORE, repeal ObamaCare, and build a Mexico-funded wall — the latter being, without a doubt, the central promise of his campaign.ADVERTISEMENTMost politicians at least wait until they're in office to pull the bait-and-switch, but Donald Trump never has been "most politicians," has he? He's backing off on his promises faster than Lena Dunham's boyfriend and if I were a Trump supporter, I would be pretty displeased right now.It makes a lot less sense to me when people are outraged at those who do exactly what they've been saying they were going to do for months, if not years.As the autopsy of Hillary Clinton's second failed bid for the presidency continues, a recurring theme is that third-party candidates and their voters are to blame. Strictly by the numbers, it's true that there were enough Gary Johnson Gary Earl JohnsonA Senator Gary Johnson could be good not just for Libertarians, but for the Senate too Clinton would beat Trump in landslide in 2016 re-run, says Hill.TV poll Rand Paul endorses Gary Johnson's Senate bid MORE and Jill Stein voters in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Florida to have put Hillary Clinton over the top had all of them had voted for the former Secretary of State.Which means about as much as saying Hillary would have won had a strange woman lying in a pond distributing swords mystically gifted the presidency to her.42% of Clinton voters think there is a "good chance" #Recount2016 will overturn the election. https://t.co/gUgCAHDN8C pic.twitter.com/otvUXysgXn — BridgetJackJeffries (@Weighted_Glory) December 2, 2016Third party candidates always run, and in this case, both Gary Johnson and Jill Stein also ran in 2012. It's a pretty safe bet that they would have drawn the same number of votes in 2016 as they did in 2012.Analyses that tell us things like "if Jill Stein's supporters and half of Gary Johnson's backers had voted Democratic, Trump would have lost the state" don't actually tell us anything meaningful because they assume a make-believe world where regular and dedicated third-party voters don't exist.When one deducts Jill Stein's 2012 votes from her 2016 totals, she only has enough new voters to flip Wisconsin (barely) and Michigan, assuming that 100% of her new voters would have otherwise voted for Clinton. But that in itself is a myopic assumption when only 89% of Democrats voted for her.If only 90% of the extra Stein voters had voted for Hillary while the rest voted for Trump or stayed home, Michigan is the only state that would have flipped. In none of these scenarios did Jill Stein voters cost Hillary Clinton the presidency.It's harder to say who Johnson hurt more since he tended to pull more evenly from both sides of the political divide. There are numerous reasons to believe that he hurt Trump more than he hurt Clinton, especially when one considers that #NeverTrump was always a stronger and more pervasive phenomenon than #NeverHillary, and the bulk of those #NeverTrump voters seem to have wound up on Johnson's doorstep.Still, splitting the new Johnson voters by 60-40 in favor of Clinton and the new Stein voters by 90-10 in favor of Clinton only flips Michigan and Wisconsin, leaving us with President-Elect Trump.Ultimately, it does not matter whether the numbers say that third party voters could have, would have, or should have delivered the election to Hillary Clinton, because since the primary season began, the #NeverTrump and #NeverHillary factions have not been silent.My latest at *The Hill*: the people cheering on #Recount2016 have taken a vacation from reality:https://t.co/rTkttCA2To — BridgetJackJeffries (@Weighted_Glory) November 29, 2016There was every indication that both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton would lose a small but significant portion of his or her own base. We pleaded with Trump and Clinton primary supporters to choose someone better; both sides sneered at us, insulted us, and dismissed our concerns.They nominated their candidates knowing that we would never join in, and while that worked out for Donald Trump (by an electoral hair), those who supported Hillary Clinton in the primary remain shocked and outraged at third
The Ministry expects that 90 million metric tons of coal will be absorbed by the domestic market in 2014. The Indonesian government aims for more domestic consumption of coal as it wants coal to supply around 30 percent of the country's energy mix by 2025 (from 24 percent in 2011), in an effort to reduce the country's dependence on expensive oil as a source for power generation.Indonesian Coal Statistics:2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Production 194 217 240 256 275 353 383 421 Export 144 163 191 198 208 272 304 349 Domestic 49 61 49 56 67 80 79 72in million tonsSource: Ministry of Energy and Mineral ResourcesIndonesia's Tighter but Confusing New Coal Export PolicyThe Ministry expects that the recent confusion that occurred in Indonesia's coal mining industry due to the tighter export policy will not translate into a significant disturbance of the country's coal exports. This new policy stipulates that Indonesian coal miners need to obtain a 'listed exporter' status (Eksportir Terdaftar, ET) from the Energy and Mineral Resources ministry to export coal. The new rule applies to both PKP2B-holders and IUP-holders. However, many Indonesian miners many faced difficulty to obtain the new license amid a lack of clarity regarding the new legal framework. Therefore, the Indonesian government delayed implementation of the new policy by one month (initially the policy would come into effect starting on 1 September 2014).To obtain the ET, Indonesian coal miners need to seek a recommendation from the Ministry for Energy and Mineral Resources first as stipulated by Regulation of the Director General of Mineral and Coal No 714 K/30/DJB/2014 (Peraturan Dirjen Minerba No 714 K/30/DJB/2014). To obtain the recommendation, the miner is required to show documents that prove it has met tax and royalty payment obligations. It is also mandatory to have the clean and clear certificate (CnC). This CnC certificate shows that the miner has no outstanding royalty and other tax debts, fulfilled exploration and environmental commitments, has no property delineation issues and obtained forestry permits.This new policy is made in order to optimize state revenue from the coal mining industry and have more supervision on coal exports (illegal coal shipments are currently still a big problem).Up to September 2014, 137 Indonesian miners have requested for the recommendation of the Energy and Mineral Resources Ministry, 47 of which have obtained the recommendation.China's Coal Import BanIt was reported that, starting from 2015, China may ban imports and local sales of coal that contains high levels of ash and sulphur in an attempt to tackle air pollution. This policy is expected to hit Australian miners the hardest as China, the world's second-largest economy, imported approximately 54 million metric tons of Australian thermal coal in 2013, most of which does not meet the newly proposed restrictions.However, the negative impact of this new policy on Indonesia, the world's major steam coal exporter, is limited as Indonesia mostly ships coal with low heating value, sulphur and ash content.Share this column‹ Back to Today's Headlines
The Nevernever is a magical realm of the supernatural separate from the normal world.Contents show]Description EditThe Nevernever is the spirit world. It exists alongside our own as a sort of alternate dimension, but its shape is not the same as the Mortal world. The Nevernever is vast, much, much larger than the mortal world, perhaps infinite.The Nevernever touches the Mortal world in places where they have something in common, a resonance of energies. If a point in the Nevernever is a dark and spooky place, then it touches a dark and spooky place in the mortal world. But, maybe five feet over, it's only sad, and that leads to a place in a cemetery on the other side of the country.[1]The Nevernever contains—somewhere—the afterlives realms known by various names: Heaven, Hell, Olympus, Elysium, Tartarus, Gehena and others.[2]Faerie EditThe Sidhe control the parts of the Nevernever that are closest to the Mortal world. It is separated in two territories ruled by the Summer and Winter Court.Ways EditMain article: WaysThe walks in the Nevernever are very rarely only five feet away, and a person might get confronted by a horrible creature. The Nevernever is a scary place. It is wise to do a lot of planning and have back-up when exploring. However, knowing the Ways, the safe paths, can get a person to a far away location quick and easy with a minimum of beastial interference.[1]Outer Gates EditMain article: Outer GatesThe Outer Gates are located at the edge of Faerie on their outer borders.[3]In the series EditGrave Peril EditMain article: Grave PerilIn Grave Peril, a well-known ectomancer, Mortimer Lindquist, has a theory that the barrier between this world and the Nevernever is slowly being torn away. He says that the border has been waggling back and forth for the last two weeks. The instability has been making it easier to form bigger, stronger ghosts when people die. Soon, the border will be so thin that there will be more problems with demon attacks than with gang violence. Mortimer is afraid of some super ghost that is apparently coming.

An Emory College German Studies professor has received a national award for her debut book examining the evolution of protagonists in modern Yiddish literature.Miriam Udel, associate professor of Yiddish language, literature and culture, and director of graduate studies at the Tam Institute for Jewish Studies, has won the National Jewish Book Award in Modern Jewish Thought and Experience for her work, Never Better! The Modern Jewish Picaresque.Udel, who grew up in the Miami area, graduated from Miami-Palmetto High School.Her book examines Yiddish fiction as it grew out of the Jewish enlightenment of the 18th and 19th centuries — which, like broader literature, was concerned with the repair and improvement of readers — and into a genre less driven by change.The title gestures at the comic spirit of one of the authors she writes about, Sholem Aleichem. His characters might have answered the question, "How are you?" with a cheerful, "Never better!" even as they feared life might not actually get better.The genre therefore embraces the Jewish role of outsider or person living at the margins of community. In that way, literature has been a response to the marginalization of Jews and Jewish aspiration, Udel said."To have it win in a category other than scholarship tells me that this book has something real to contribute to the conversation about modern Jewish thought," Udel said. "I believe it has the potential to shape what we talk about and how we discuss issues."The Jewish Book Council honored Udel and other award winners at a ceremony in March at the Center for Jewish History in New York City. The council began recognizing authors through its awards program in 1950.Hiram Maxim, chair of the Emory German Studies department, is proud of the Udel's award and its timing, coming during her second year of a deep dive with Emory colleagues into the often overlooked body of 20th Century Yiddish children's literature published between and immediately after World Wars I and II."The award is a wonderful affirmation of Dr. Udel's outstanding contribution to the scholarship on modernist Jewish literature, and the department is already excited about her next book project on Yiddish children's literature, a topic that she is exploring this semester in a jointly taught course with Dr. Marshall Duke from the psychology department," Maxim said.Udel said she also collaborated with her husband, Adam Zachary Newton, a distinguished visiting professor at the Fox Center for Humanistic Inquiry, on her debut book.

Netherlands' Party for Freedom (PVV) leader Geert Wilders arrives for a news conference after a European far-right leaders meeting in Koblenz, Germany, January 21, 2017. REUTERS/Wolfgang RattayAMSTERDAM Campaigning for the Dutch election began on Wednesday with anti-Islam leader Geert Wilders frontrunner in a vote that will test the anti-establishment sentiment that swept Britain out of the European Union and Donald Trump into the U.S. presidency.Wilders, a eurosceptic, anti-immigration fan of Trump, has dubbed the March 15 parliamentary election the start of a "Patriotic Spring" in Europe, where French and German voters go to the polls in May and September.Wilders and his Party for Freedom has led in opinion polls for most of the past two years, but the fragmented political landscape means a coalition government of four or more parties is all but inevitable.ADVERTISING inRead invented by TeadsADVERTISING inRead invented by TeadsHis main rival, Prime Minister Mark Rutte of the conservative VVD Party, is banking on a strengthening economic recovery to restore popularity lost during the austerity years of 2012-2014.The two announced on Wednesday they will face off head-to-head in a televised debate on March 13.Wilders' party is expected to get 20 percent of the popular vote, compared to Rutte's 16 percent. A simple majority is generally sought to govern, but all but one party have ruled out sharing power with Wilders, whose policies are seen by many as offensive and sometimes unconstitutional.There are 31 parties competing for votes, with 14 likely to win at least one seat in the 150-member parliament. The next three largest parties command no more than 10 or 11 percent of the vote each."The overwhelming majority of Dutchmen basically do not vote for (Wilders)," said Kristof Jacobs, a teacher at Radbout University in Nijmegen.NO "NEXIT"So a victory for Wilders is unlikely to lead to the Netherlands leaving the European Union, closing the border to Muslim immigrants or reinstating the Dutch currency, policies only his party endorses.In December, Wilders was convicted of inciting discrimination for leading supporters in a chant that they wanted "Fewer! Fewer! Fewer!" Moroccans in the country.A study published by the Social Affairs Ministry on Tuesday found that up to 40 percent of the Turks and Moroccans in the Netherlands do not feel they belong or are accepted.If Wilders' PVV party finishes first but is unable to form a government, Rutte will be left trying to forge a centrist coalition with several parties that share little more than opposition to Wilders.In that case "we will stay put and manage the country until there is a new coalition," Finance Minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem said on Tuesday, quipping the situation could persist for "years" under the constitution.The Netherlands, a country of 17 million that relies heavily on foreign trade, in 2005 rejected the European constitution and last year voted down a treaty for closer EU ties with Ukraine.A poll by Motivaction on Tuesday showed more than 61 percent of respondents see Dutch politicians as "elitist, unreliable and dishonest."Around 37 percent of likely voters said they hadn't decided who to vote for."I find it difficult to make a decision," said Renee Keijzer, from the town of Volendam. "So much has happened in the world that it is hard to position yourself properly."(Additional reporting by Stephanie van den Berg; Editing by Anthony Deutsch and Janet Lawrence)
Page ContentParentcraft Services is a free-standing Unit, forming part of the Obstetric Department and situated at Level 1, Block E, Mater Dei Hospital.The Mission of Parentcraft Services is "Education and Support".Education is mainly carried out through courses offered to expectant clients/couples, but also in the form of Post natal sessions (alias reunions), which serve as an educational tool as many queries are answered and information straightened out during these meetings.In late 2011, were also introduced the very popular sessions for Grandparents. Furthermore, a number of ad hoc sessions are also offered, while Education also includes sessions for student nurses/midwives, secondary or post-secondary students.Parentcraft Courses include: Early Pregnancy Courses (starting from 10 weeks pregnancy) and Childbirth Courses (usually starting from 28 – 30 weeks pregnancy). The latter are also available for specific groups, including English Speaking Clients, parents with other children (Refresher), Couples expecting Multiples, and School-age clients (held at Ghozza).Courses are offered in the morning, afternoon and evening. This includes weekdays, Saturdays, Sundays and even Public Holidays. Most times, 2 or more concurrent sessions are held. As can be expected, the most popular lectures are those held in the evenings, weekends, and on Sunday mornings, with the latter having 4 or even 5 concurrent sessions. Evening, weekend, and Sunday groups are considerably large, with an average of 18-22 couples per group.Furthermore, there has been a considerable increase in one-to-one sessions. These include clients with special needs, e.g. partner abroad, single mothers with problems, social problems, drug abuse, low IQ; deaf/dumb; pre-adoptive parents; etc.Other sessions are also held regularly, in liaison with other Units/Departments. These include sessions about Dental Care, Standards of Childcare Centres, Stem Cell Collection, Speech and Language Development, Healthy Weight in Infants and Toddlers, etc.Besides lectures at MDH, Parentcraft Education is also offered through the Media, through various professional handouts and booklets, and through active participation and organization of conferences for the general public.Furthermore, an innovative project is the "Mother and Child module" being presently offered to 175 MCAST Students.Furthermore, Parentcraft Services Support has a very popular Support Tel. Helpline - 2545 5124, where clients can call in, to ask help for any problem, both during pregnancy or after delivery. The telephone helpline is open to all, including those who have never attended, relatives, and anyone wishing to make use of this service. Calls vary from brief ones enquiring about the courses or about their applications, to complicated and intense ones, sometimes requiring referral to other Departments/Units.There has also been a significant increase in one-to-one counselling sessions, presenting mostly with pregnancy-related, emotional, or social issues, the latter many times requiring referral to the Social Work Unit. We also have the possibility of referral for Familiy Therapy.Furthermore, Parent Craft Services works in close liaison with various Services and Departments, including: Ghozza (Education Department – formerly called School Girl Mothers Unit), Il-Benniena and Homestart (Social Services); SANDS (Stillbirth and Neonatal Death Society) and the Bereavement Midwife; ABC (Association of Breastfeeding Counsellors) and Breastfeeding Walk-In Clinic; Caesarean Support Group, TIPS (Tiny Infant Parent Support); Multiple Connection, Richmond Foundation, Institute of Familty Therapy (IFT), SEDQA, Midwives Association, Health Promotion Unit, Faculty of Health, Institute for Further Studies, MCAST, etcParentcraft Services also has a generic email - parentcraft@gov.mt that serves both for Education and for Support purposes, while arrangements are being made to offer a Facebook page.Many more projects are in the offing, including Early Pregnancy Courses for Teenage Mums-to-be which will start in November/December 2013. These specific courses will be offered on Sunday mornings, so that they will not interfere with school. The father-to-be and both sets of parents are all invited to attend.Various talks are also being held with the Education Department, and with other Departments and Organisations, further optimizing the already sterling service being provided to the Maltese Public.
Some Interesting Facts about Nikola TeslaDid You Know?...Tesla was considered an eccentric man who talked of death rays that could destroy 10,000 airplanes at a distance of 250 miles. However, Tesla devised the AC (alternating current) system that we use in our homes today. AC offered great advantages over the rival DC system.By using Tesla's transformers, AC voltages could be stepped up (or down) and transmitted over long distances through thin wires. DC could not (it required a large power plant every square mile and had to be transmitted through very thick cables). Tesla also invented electric motors that today are used in every appliance in your house. He invented fluorescent bulbs and neon signs. He designed the world's first hydroelectric plant, in Niagara Falls and patented the first speedometer for cars. Thomas Edison, who's money was invested in DC power systems, did his best to discredit Tesla. Edison even went so far as to claimed that AC electricity was far more dangerous than his DC power.At the 1893 World Exposition in Chicago, Tesla demonstrated the safety AC electricity was by passing high frequency AC power through his body to power light bulbs. He then was able to shoot large lightning bolts from his Tesla coils to the crowd without harm.By 1898, he was demonstrating to the world the first remote controlled model boat at Madison Square Garden. Tesla wanted to provide free energy to the world and in 1900 began construction of a "Wireless Broadcasting System" tower on Long Island, New York. This tower was intended to link the world's telephone and telegraph services, and transmit pictures, stock reports, and weather information worldwide.Tesla ran into financial trouble with the world thinking he was insane. The transmission of voice, picture, and electricity was unheard of at this time.Tesla demonstrated the principles behind radio nearly ten years before Marconi. In 1943 the US Supreme Court ruled that Marconi's patents were invalid due to Tesla's descriptions of his work. Still, most references do not credit Tesla with the invention of radio.Tesla made the earth into an electric tuning fork by getting a steam-driven oscillator to vibrate at the same frequency as the ground. The result was an earthquake in the surrounding city. He had accurately determined the resonant frequencies of the Earth almost 60 years before science could confirm his results.In 1899, he sent waves of energy through the Earth, thus providing the theory for earthquake seismic stations. By adding electricity to the returning energy he created the largest man-made lightning bolt ever recorded (130 feet). The accompanying thunder was heard 22 miles away and created a blue glow around the meadow outside his Colorado laboratory.At the beginning of World War I, Tesla proposed the use of energy waves to detect German submarines (known today as RADAR). Thomas Edison rejected his idea as ludicrous.Eventually, Tesla was awarded the Edison Medal, which was an insult to Tesla, given the verbal abuse that he had taken from Edison.Tesla died penniless at age 86 on January 7, 1943. In his lifetime, he received over 800 different patents. Scientists continue to scour through his notes.The "Tesla bladeless disk turbine engine" that he designed, when made with modern materials, is proving to be among the most efficient motors ever made. Experiments he performed with cryogenic liquids and electricity provide the foundation for modern superconductors. He also talked about experiments that suggested particles with fractional charges of an electron. In 1977 they were "discovered" as quarks! Nikola Tesla has been referred to as "the man who invented the 20th century." His use of alternating electrical currents and invention of the AC engine brought revolutionary changes in electrical power generation and transmission that remain the global standard today. Tesla recited entire books from memory, and designed his machines in his head, rather than on paper. He was also frequently ridiculed for proposing "impossible" inventions … which he then went and invented anyway.Various Nikola Tesla Quotes:* "The idea came like a flash of lightning and in an instant the truth was revealed." * "The motors I build there were exactly as I imagined them. I made no attempt to improve the design, but merely reproduced the pictures as they appeared to my vision and the operation was always as I expected." * "Ideas came in an uninterrupted stream and the only difficulty I had was to hold them fast ... In less than two months I evolved virtually all the types of motors and modifications of the systems which now identified with my name." * "I do not think there is any thrill that can go through the human heart like that felt by the inventor as he sees some creation of the brain unfolding to success... Such emotions make a man forget food, sleep, friends, love, everything." * "Instinct is something which transcends knowledge. We have, undoubtedly, certain finer fibers that enable us to perceive truths when logical deduction, or any other willful effort of the brain,
The vice presidential candidate is courting Bacolod City voters in a campaign stop with his wife, who traces her roots to Bago CityPublished 8:00 AM, April 13, 2016BACOLOD CITY, Philippines – Senator Ferdinand Marcos Jr is hoping to drum up support for his vice presidential bid in Negros Occidental, a known bailiwick of Liberal Party (LP) standard bearer Manuel Roxas II, as he campaigned in this city accompanied by his Negrense wife.The vice presidential candidate was in the capital of Negros Occidental province on Tuesday, April 12, to meet with Bacolod Bishop Vicente Navarra and barangay leaders.He also called on Negros Occidental Governor Alfredo Marañon Jr., a staunch supporter of Roxas, and Mayor Monico Puentevella at the Provincial Capitol and the People's House.The province is a known bailiwick of Roxas, whose mother Judy Araneta-Roxas is from Bago City.Marcos' wife, Louise Araneta-Marcos, also traces her roots to Bago City. She is also the second cousin of the administration candidate."Everyone here is Ilonggo by birth. I'm Ilonggo by choice because I married an Ilongga from Bago. I have a particularly close feeling for Bacolod and Negros," Marcos said.He added that local candidates were friends of his, though he acknowledged that they are members of the LP, and that they have to work within the confines of the party line."They know my capabilities and my plans. That's how we are approaching different areas, and Negros is one of them. We feel we have support of all quarters," the senator said.Asked if he could sway Marañon on his side, Marcos said that it was clear that the governor is with the majority, but did not dismiss the possibility."We've known each other for quite a long time. He knows me as a person. Maganda naman pagkakakilala niya sa akin. Whether or not [the governor will support me], we will continue to campaign," the senator said.He added, "We'd like many people to join us in our campaign. And we'd be very pleased if all the leaders will also support and help us."Marañon backing RobredoWhile Marañon admitted that many Negrenses are also supporting Marcos' bid, he said that he is backing the candidacy of the LP's vice presidential bet, Camarines Sur Representative Leni Robredo."I'm for Leni...When I said I'm supporting a candidate, I will really support that candidate. I won't betray that support. If I don't like the candidate, I will tell them frankly that I don't like them and that I'm supporting somebody else," Marañon said.The governor also complimented Marcos on how he handled himself during Sunday's vice presidential debate. The senator was the subject of attacks from his rivals over the ill-gotten wealth amassed by his family during the martial law years."I admire his patience," Marañon said.Meetings, protestsAccompanied by his wife and son Zandro, Marcos also met with Bacolod Bishop Vicente Navarra at the Bishop's House during his visit to the city.Navarra said that the meeting was "very cordial and [we exchanged] pleasantries," adding that they did not talk politics."We wish him all the best. I told him to keep cool and treat everybody as his friend. Maintain his desire to serve the people if ever he gets elected," Navarra said.Meanwhile, about 50 members of activist groups Karapatan and Bayan held a picket at the Central Market, where Marcos met with vendors Tuesday morning. They also held a rally at Casa Orola at Rizal Street, where the senator met with members of BBM Volunteers in the afternoon.Clarizza Dagatan, secretary-general of Karapatan-Negros, said that they were urging people not to give Marcos a chance to return to office."He has no remorse with the human rights abuses committed by his family during the Martial Law," she said.Remembering EscalanteDuring the reign of Marcos' father, the late President Ferdinand Marcos, Negros was a province keen on ending the dictatorship when the sugar crisis erupted in the late 1970s. Sugar is the primary commodity of the Negros islands.One of the biggest rallies in the locality led to a gruesome incident dubbed as the Escalante Massacre. Several protesters were gunned down by government forces who were later charged with various counts of murder and frustrated murder.More than 40 security

SOFIA (Reuters) - Bulgaria's nationalist Attack party will work to topple the government if Sofia backs a new round of Western sanctions against Russia over its annexation of Crimea, the party's leader told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday.Leader of Bulgarian nationalist Attack party Volen Siderov (R) arrives at Sofia's investigative service building March 12, 2014. REUTERS/Stoyan NenovAttack holds the balance of power in the Bulgarian parliament, and its threat is an extreme example of the domestic pressures European governments face in taking a position on the worst crisis in East-West relations since the Cold War.If the party pulls the plug on Prime Minister Plamen Oresharski's minority coalition government, it could tip the European Union's poorest member state back into political instability. Months of street protests felled one government last year and almost toppled its successor, at a time when the country was struggling to revive economic growth.Bulgarian leaders' position in relation to the Ukraine crisis is especially precarious. On the one hand, the country has pushed for closer ties with the EU bloc, which it joined seven years ago. On the other hand, it is almost entirely dependent on Russian energy supplies, and many Bulgarians feel a deep affinity for their giant neighbour across the Black Sea.Attack, which is a noisy critic of the United States and Bulgaria's NATO membership, is the only Bulgarian party to openly champion Russia's intervention in the Ukraine."If the current Bulgarian government supports them (tougher sanctions), I will take a firm opposition line towards it and I will work for its toppling," party chairman Volen Siderov said in an interview in his office in the Bulgarian capital."Then we will have to ask ourselves the question what government and what majority will come after it, whether it willbe the same, or whether it can be changed," he said."It is a problem for the voters, who have to wake up and finally understand that the government in Bulgaria should have an independent policy and put an end to colonialism that we have been forced into."As if to underscore Bulgarian ties to Russia, Siderov has antique guns and swords fixed on his office wall - some of them relics of Russia's wars against Turkey in the 19th century that helped Bulgaria throw off 500 years of Ottoman rule.TAKING A STANDAs well as the threat of Attack withdrawing its support, the ruling Socialist party also risks angering voters in the European elections in May. The elections are seen as a key test for the survival of a government that has already faced down three confidence votes since taking power last year.A Gallup poll last week underlined the country's divided loyalties: 30 percent of Bulgarians supported Ukraine joining the EU, while 27 percent supported Ukraine forging closer links with Russia instead.The Socialist party is a direct descendant of the communists who governed Bulgaria before the fall of the Berlin Wall, when the country was seen as Moscow's most pliable ally. Many of its core supporters are pro-Russia.Its conflicted position has led the government to send mixed signals about its intentions. Bulgaria allowed the first round of sanctions against Russia and twice took part in navy drills with a U.S. warship in the Black Sea. The prime minister said the country would not support further sanctions, but then also suggested Bulgaria would not veto them if imposed.In any case, a new round of punitive measures might be fiercely resisted by many of the EU's other ex-communist nations, who are fearful of Russia's aggression but have the most to lose by imposing sanctions."Bulgaria needs to impose a veto," said Siderov, a white-haired former journalist, who was charged with hooliganism earlier this month after an alleged row with a female French diplomat on a plane. "It has the right to do that and then the European Union will not be able to impose sanctions," he added."And silently, and not officially, the German and French representatives will say "well done for saving us", because their turnover with Russia is in tens of billions of euros."
In a shocking incident, a ten-day-old newborn died after being bitten by rats in the intensive care unit(ICU) of the government hospital in Guntur on Wednesday. Wounds were seen on the face and body of the newborn.Andhra Pradesh Health Minister Dr K Srinivas had sought a report from the hospital in this regard and an inquiry has also been ordered into the incident, Hospital Superintendent Dr Venugopal said.The boy was born to a woman named Laxmi on August 17 at the Vijayawada General Hospital. He was shifted to Guntur for a surgery after developing some health complications, and afterwards placed in the ICU, he said.His mother noticed this morning that the boy's right hand fingers had been bitten by rats. He died during the treatment, said the superintendent.
SACRAMENTO — Facing a torrent of accusations, a for-profit company that operates taxpayer-funded online charter schools throughout California has reached a $168.5 million settlement with the state over claims it manipulated attendance records and overstated its students' success.The deal, announced Friday by Attorney General Kamala Harris, comes almost three months after the Bay Area News Group published an investigation of K12 Inc., a publicly traded Virginia company, which raked in more than $310 million in state funding over the past 12 years operating a profitable but low-performing network of "virtual" schools for about 15,000 students."Knowing that something will be done to address the schools' problems is very reassuring," said Gabriela Novak, who pulled her daughter Elizabeth from K12's San Mateo County school after a year of frustrations and difficulty communicating with her teachers. "Finally, the system is working."Harris' office found that K12 and the 14 California Virtual Academies used deceptive advertising to mislead families about students' academic progress, parents' satisfaction with the program and their graduates' eligibility for University of California and California State University admission — issues that were exposed in this news organization's April report.The settlement could help spur legislation that would prevent for-profit companies like K12 from operating public schools in California.The Attorney General's office also found that K12 and its affiliated schools collected more state funding from the California Department of Education than they were entitled to by submitting inflated student attendance data and that the company leaned on the nonprofit schools to sign unfavorable contracts that put them in a deep financial hole."K12 and its schools misled parents and the State of California by claiming taxpayer dollars for questionable student attendance, misstating student success and parent satisfaction and loading nonprofit charities with debt," Harris said in a statement. "This settlement ensures K12 and its schools are held accountable and make much-needed improvements."The California Teachers Association and the California Charter Schools Association both applauded Harris' announcement and denounced the company's practices — even though the two special-interest groups are frequently foes.But in a news release Friday, K12 stressed that it had admitted no wrongdoing and insisted it had already planned to take up several of the 60 corrective actions required under the agreement over the next few years. It also disputed the attorney general's description of the size of the settlement, calling it "flat wrong.""Despite our full cooperation throughout the process, the Office of the Attorney General grossly mischaracterized the value of the settlement just as it did with regard to the issues it investigated," K12 Chief Executive Officer Stuart Udell said in the statement.Under the settlement, which is subject to court approval, K12 will pay $8.5 million to settle the state's claims.It also agreed to "expunge" about $160 million in credits it has issued to the California Virtual Academies since 2005 that have helped the schools cover the cost of the contracts they hold with the company, whose rates routinely exceed what the schools can afford.But Udell said that the credits should be called "subsidies," not debts, and that the company's commitment to expunge them shouldn't be used by Harris to hike the size of the settlement. He also defended the credits, saying they had protected the schools against financial uncertainties."(The) schools have not paid that money to K12 and K12 never expected to receive it given California's funding environment," Udell said.This news organization's investigation into K12's California schools revealed the company reaps tens of millions of dollars annually in state funding while graduating fewer than half of its high school students. It also showed that kids who spend as little as one minute during a school day logged onto K12's software may have been counted as "present" in records used to calculate the amount of funding the schools get from the state.The revelations show why California needs tighter rules for online charter schools, said Bruce Fuller, an education policy professor at UC Berkeley."Virtual charter schools' profit-seeking too often leads to deception about their true effectiveness," Fuller said. "The Legislature should move aggressively to prevent such harm to students and taxpayers."The settlement requires K12 to take a slew of corrective actions.The company must: ensure the accuracy of its advertisements, train teachers to prevent improper attendance claims and reform the way K12 contracts with the California Virtual Academies.K12 must also eliminate any type of incentive compensation for its enrollment staff, provide all students functional computers and give families a subsidy of at least $20 per month to cover the cost of high-speed internet service.Emily Bertelli, a spokeswoman for the California Charter Schools Association, called the settlement "a good start," but said the Legislature must change the law to prevent such abusive practices from happening again.When lawmakers return to work in August after a monthlong summer
Increasing dredging requirements resulting from Enbridge's massive oil spill into Michigan's Kalamazoo River in 2010 could push the cleanup bill to almost $1-billion, above and beyond what is covered by the insurance of the company's U.S. affiliate, that unit reported on Wednesday.Earlier this month, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ordered Enbridge to perform additional dredging to remove submerged oil and to maintain sediment traps throughout the river as a result of the Line 6B rupture. On Wednesday, Enbridge Energy Partners L.P. estimated it will incur approximately $175-million more in costs to pay for the additional work. "This estimate is an increase to the total estimated costs of $820-million related to the Line 6B crude oil release that was previously disclosed and excludes any additional fines and penalties," it said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission."The actual costs incurred may differ from the foregoing estimate as we discuss our work plan with the EPA and work with other regulatory agencies to assure that our work plan complies with their requirements. Any such incremental costs will not be recovered under our insurance policies as our expected costs for the incident will exceed the limits of our insurance coverage."Story continues below advertisementThe partnership operates the U.S. portion of Enbridge's oil pipeline network, which moves more than two million barrels a day to the U.S. Midwest, Midcontinent and Southern Ontario from Western Canada.Late Wednesday, a spokesman from parent company Enbridge Inc. said at this point the company won't discuss its total out-of-pocket costs. But he noted the annual report, which stated claims for the Line 6B release are covered by Enbridge's comprehensive insurance policy. That policy had an aggregate limit of $650-million (U.S.) for pollution liability."We are still in the middle of this process and cannot determine what total costs will be," Graham White said in an e-mail.More than three million litres of oil leaked into wetlands, Talmadge Creek and the Kalamazoo River after a pipeline ruptured near Marshall, Mich., on July 25, 2010. A ruling last year by a U.S. regulator pummelled Enbridge's response, describing it as being so poor that "you can't help but think of the Keystone Kops."The spill, the largest onshore oil spill in U.S. history, has given significant ammunition to opponents of new projects, including TransCanada's proposed Keystone XL pipeline and Enbridge's Northern Gateway.With a report from Reuters
Renting accommodation to illegal immigrants is to become an offence from December, Amber Rudd has announced.Speaking at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, the home secretary said: "Today I'm announcing that from December, landlords that knowingly rent out property to people who have no right to be here will be committing a criminal offence - they could go to prison."Ms Rudd also announced that from December, immigration checks will be a mandatory requirement for people who want to obtain a licence to drive a taxi.From next autumn, banks will also have to carry out regular checks to ensure they are not providing essential banking service to illegal migrants.The home secretary also said the government will launch a consultation on whether to make it more difficult for companies to hire foreign workers.
Photo by Mike Coppola/Getty ImagesThis article originally appeared in Vulture."When I'm onstage, I get real happy up there. Maybe that's the only time in my adult life that I feel like myself. You're standing up there—you know what I mean—like a gladiator, and them lights is on you, and you look down and everyone's looking up at you ... and it's all these smiles around you. And they get dressed and they put perfume on and stuff, and they're going to see your show. That feels good, man. These people, you know, they love you. Even if it's for a minute, they really do. They love you, man. You know, it's like a love-fest ... It's the best feeling, man. I love stand-up." – Dave Chappelle, Inside the Actor's Studio, 2006The lights go dark. A giant silhouette of Dave Chappelle appears onstage. The curtain drops, and all you see is a puff of smoke. Wearing a slim black two-button suit, he tells the crowd, who collectively decided to giving him a standing ovation before he said a word, to sit down, to relax. "This is a very special night," he says before launching into his first joke. "You know what I feel like, being in New York this week? Like a motherfucker who's been locked up for a decade." He pauses there, puffs his American Spirit, and lets the laughter settle a little. "People see me like, 'Damn, nigga, you got swole. How have you been, baby boy?' Pretty good! Pretty fucking good." The crowd erupts in approval.AdvertisementThis is why he quit Chappelle's Show. This is why he walked away from $50 million nine years ago. This is why he went to Africa. This is why he went silent, kept silent, and lived on a farm in Ohio. This is why he'd only reappear occasionally to perform poorly reviewed, loose, meandering sets of essentially shooting the shit. This is why, 10 months ago, he stopped a performance in Hartford and just quietly read his book onstage. It wasn't because he was crazy or on drugs or any of the myriad reasons people who aren't Dave Chappelle liked to say. He quit so he could eventually come back and perform a show like the one he did last night, at Radio City Music Hall, in front of 6,000 deferential, diverse, well-dressed fans.When I enter, I'm instantly and surprisingly overwhelmed with emotion. With a jazz trio called Supa Lowery Bros at the top of the stairs, playing an instrumental version of Kendrick Lamar's oddly appropriate "Bitch Don't Kill My Vibe," I'm taken by how incredibly eclectic and buzzing the crowd is. I'm not exaggerating when I say it is the most diverse room I've ever been in. It looks like the streets of New York City were moved inside. It looks like the cast of Orange Is the New Black if it were half male and everyone were allowed to wear their cutest outfits (and not just because I eventually sat two seats down from Natasha Lyonne). A young Asian guy wearing a hat with the New Yorker logo on it stands in line in front of a white guy in a Twiztid hat, an Indian guy in a suit, an African-American skater in a Obey hat, and a woman in dreads who was talking to a woman with a feather in her hair. This is why Chappelle's run of ten shows needed to be here, at Radio City. It's big enough that I could see how wide-reaching his fan base is, but not so big (like Madison Square Garden would've been) that we turned into a faceless blob just moving in and out of passageways. With the band now playing a jazzed-up version of a Kanye West song, it is all reminiscent of Dave Chappelle's Block Party, Chappelle's 2006 concert documentary, which the comedian called the "best day of my career."The vibe continues inside Radio City's massive auditorium, where a DJ spins a mix of neo-soul, old-school hip-hop, and random nostalgia hat-tips. Everyone knows every word of Biggie's "Juicy" and the Cheers theme song. This is the first of the five shows Chappelle added after the first five sold out. Unlike on the previous nights, Chappelle splits the bill with a musician. In this case, Nas. Though Chappelle goes on first, don't be fooled. It is his show.Because he has a musician follow him, Chappelle's one-hour-and-change set differs from the 90-minute ones that many publications reviewed last week. It's a tight set. It is hour

The building will house some 470 antennas and more than 20,000 linear feet of coaxial cable to ensure residents paying $4.3 million and up for apartments will have uninterrupted wireless service. "For this level of building that's top-end in every way, a D.A.S. is just part of the scope of the work," Mr. Gordon said.Even in buildings that receive wireless signals, residents may experience problems if too many people in the area use the same wireless network at the same time. An in-house wireless network would reduce such capacity issues when call volume is high.The antenna technology is fairly common in stadiums, hotels and more recently, office towers, said Laura Keyes, a senior account executive at Axispoint Technology Solutions Group, which designs and installs distributed antenna systems. "Residential buildings were later to the game," she said, "but now almost all new construction includes a specification for D.A.S."Over the last year, the firm has designed 14 distributed antenna systems for new residential and commercial towers, double the number of the previous year. Clients range from the Modern, a 450-unit rental near the entrance to the George Washington Bridge in Fort Lee, N.J., to 432 Park Avenue in Manhattan, which topped out last year at 1,396 feet and holds the title for the tallest residential tower in the Western Hemisphere.Adding the systems to older apartment buildings is rare, Ms. Keyes said. Once residents are in place, she said, management "doesn't have an incentive to spend the money." The exception is apartment complexes that are undergoing a major renovation. Retrofits are more common in commercial buildings like offices and hospitals, she noted, because of the demand for wireless in such environments.Several years ago, Time Equities acquired the top 10 floors of 633 Third Avenue, a 40-story tower where Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has an office. Spotty cellphone coverage had been a problem at the building, and when the governor's lease was up, souping up reception "became a negotiation point in the renewal," said Robert Singer, the director of development for Time Equities. "As you might imagine, we had to quickly get in the game and figure out how to solve it."

Matthews, a native of Scottsdale, Ariz., now looks to become the first American-born player selected No. 1 in the NHL Draft since Patrick Kane was chosen by the Chicago Blackhawks in 2007.It isn't every day you see an 18-year-old prodigy take his talents overseas and dominate against many NHL-caliber players the way Auston Matthews did this season for Zurich in National League A, Switzerland's top professional league.The 6-foot-1, 210-pound left-handed center is No. 1 on NHL Central Scouting's midterm list of international skaters eligible for the 2016 draft on June 24-25 in Buffalo, N.Y. Goran Stubb, the NHL Director of European Scouting, is in the process of finalizing the last international ranking to be released next month on NHL.com.Many think that if Matthews was born 48 hours earlier, making him eligible for the 2015 draft, he might have given Massachusetts native Jack Eichel a run for his money as the top American-born player selected.Eichel went No. 2 to the Buffalo Sabres after Connor McDavid was chosen No. 1 by the Edmonton Oilers.While Matthews performed well against men this season, finishing second in voting for National League A most valuable player, Eichel has also proven to be no slouch in his rookie season in the NHL.That raises an interesting question: Are Matthews and Eichel more similar or different in their approach and style to the game?"We're both pretty big guys and we like to have the puck on our stick; we're both power forwards," Matthews told NHL.com. "I think the style of our game might be a little bit different. Jack is obviously an unbelievable skater. I've never seen somebody skate like him. He has a great shot and is really powerful. I kind of am a little bit quicker in the corners and stuff with my hands. I try to use my hands and vision a lot."David Gregory, who has evaluated prospects for Central Scouting the past 15 years, saw plenty of Matthews last season with USA Hockey's National Team Development Program and followed the path of Eichel during his Hobey Baker Award-winning season at Boston University."I guess it's a little like asking me to compare Rembrandt and Picasso," Gregory said. "They both make your art gallery better."Eichel and Matthews teamed up for the United States at the 2015 World Junior Championship. Eichel, who was captain, had one goal and four points in five games. Matthews, the youngest player on the U.S. roster, had one goal and three points in five games.Video: WPG@BUF: Eichel beats Hutchinson for the lead"Where Jack and Auston are similar is that they are both great on their edges," NCAA hockey analyst Dave Starman said. "They are both great with the puck wide of their body; they glide fast. Even when they're not moving their feet, they're so strong and so good on their edges they generate a lot of speed even without their feet moving."Left wing Matthew Tkachuk, No. 1 on NHL Central Scouting's midterm ranking of North American skaters eligible for the draft, has skated alongside each player."They are both really competitive and have the puck on their stick the whole game," Tkachuk said. "They are fast, hard to play against, and along the boards they're going to come out with the puck. Auston seems to have the puck glued to his stick and Eichel has straight-away speed. He's probably the fastest I've ever seen from blue line to blue line."Eichel had 38 goals and 87 points in 53 games for USA Hockey's Under-18 NTDP in 2013-14. Matthews had 55 goals and 116 points in 60 games for the U-18 NTDP in 2014-15.Danton Cole coached each player at the USA Hockey program in Plymouth, Mich."From a physical standpoint they're both very similar, but it's a different-type game," Cole said. "People have seen Jack play now and aren't surprised anymore with the power he plays with. With Auston, I don't want to say he's more finesse, but maybe more of a cutter, whereas Jack is more power."But they're big centers who play at a real hard pace and what's very similar is that they each have a competitive burn to succeed at all costs."Some see Eichel as a two-way power forward who produces points and Matthews as a two-way skilled forward who produces points. Others believe Eichel is more dominant in open ice, but Matthews is more of a force in tight quarters. Either way, a team can't go wrong."Matthews to
Co-opting Narratives of the Otherby Yasmine Nagaty"There's really no such thing as the 'voiceless'. There are only the deliberately silenced, or the preferably unheard."This is the famous assertion made by renowned author and political activist Arundhati Roy. The term, "giving voice to the voiceless"- with which we are now all too familiar finds its roots in the contours of classic imperialist thought, where the "civilized" (essentially Western, white connoisseurs of knowledge and development) have gained more of a "self" by going out to "help" communities of the so-called third world. Of course, at the heart of this self-acclaimed charity lies the responsibility of representing the marginalized of those communities.Representing women (as well as children) continues to be a profitable business for the Western media. Indeed, anthropologists Arthur and Joan Kleinman note that images of distant, suffering women and their children suggest there are communities incapable of or uninterested in caring for its own people. This logic thus suggests the need to re-write the stories of suffering of these individuals.And yet, whereas the old and tired variations of "giving voice to the voiceless" have sought to narrate these stories, the latest recreation of this phenomenon is to provide the platform from which women can narrate their stories of suffering themselves. This is done in a space sponsored and confined by the same Western discourse that has continued to dictate representations of their communities.By now the identity of these communities is a no-brainer; they are the communities of the "global south", the "third world", of any essentially non-Western community. Among many, anthropologist Homa Hoodfar notes that for the past two decades, Muslim women in particular, have been the most pervasive subjects of discussion in Western media. She attributes this phenomenon to the notion that,"Failing to contextualize non-western societies adequately, researchers simply assume that what is good for western middle-class women should be good for all women."Due to this tendency, as well as a general fixation on the lifestyles of Muslim women, marriage and the veil (the two topics most dubbed as features of otherness in Muslim culture) are the most enduring subjects covered by western media.In the one camp, honor killings, child marriage, forced marriage and forced veiling appear as some of the most prominent headlines here.In the other camp, which is equally dangerous, appear the outliers of this discourse, the narratives that seek to illustrate just how normal (normal here denoting consensual) marriage and choices of dress can be for Muslim women.This month, The Independent published an article titled "Bravo DKNY for a Ramadan Collection that Shows Muslim Dress Means More Than a Burqa." The author, a Muslim Pakistani writer by the name of Bina Shah, seeks to illustrate how the choice of fashion line and models is itself a "controversy" that contrasts starkly with the decision of the European Court of Human Rights to uphold France's ban on the niqab. Images of the models, proudly identified by the author as two Middle Eastern women; one fashion editor of Styles Magazine and the other a fashion designer in Dubai are attached. This collection of DKNY, she claims, shows that Muslim women can be "effortlessly chic and modest at the same time."This statement, along with the title of the piece, suggest that it is OK for Muslim women to dress in a manner different from the quintessential styles offered by Western brands like DKNY, in "long, flowing dresses, long-sleeved shirts, coats, and even a three-quarters-length leather jacket." At the same time, this is vaguely pitted as an alternative to the now imposed ban on the niqab and more conservative forms of Muslim dress. The logical flaw in this argument is evident, for the author fails to establish relevance between the two, instead referencing both DKNY's Ramadan collection and the niqab ban as "controversies." There is a vague assumption here that with the ban on the niqab, Muslim women would be at a loss for what to wear.Another peculiar piece published on The Huffington Post this month reads, "Force or Choice? American Muslim Marriages." The crux of this article is the notion that forced marriages are- as though this is a surprise- not representative of Muslim marriages in the US. To nail home the point, images and stories of Muslim couples are attached to illustrate just how consensual these marriages are.Some will ask what the problem with these representations are if their goal is to break essentially racist and orientalist perceptions of Muslims and Islam. The problem, simply, is the apologetic undertone used in articles like these for the very existence of the identity of "Muslim women" and the perceived dictations of Islam. It is the notion that there is a
One of the more common refrains during America's nearly ever-present campaign season is that this election, this year, is the most important of our lives. We documented this in July, noting that it was first used in one form or another back in 1856, but has been common since at least 1980. Why is each election most important? Well, that's often a bit more nebulous.According to a new survey from PRRI and The Atlantic, we can describe one way in which voters in 2016 felt this was the most important election in history. Forty-one percent of respondents – including two-thirds of those who voted for Donald Trump – felt that the 2016 election was critical because it was our last chance to "stop America's decline."The fraction of Hillary Clinton voters who agreed with that sentiment was much smaller, at only a fifth.Trump himself positioned this election as a final opportunity for his party, at one point telling the Christian Broadcasting Network's David Brody that 2016 was "the last election that the Republicans have a chance of winning" — in part thanks to shifting demographics. The idea of decline clearly also overlaps with the motto embroidered into his hats. America was once great; it no longer is; Trump will reverse that. The decline will stop.Responses to the question also correlate to age and economic status. Older Americans were more likely to agree with the sentiment, as were members of the white working class.The net result of the election is that those voters who were worried about the decline of the United States are now among the most optimistic about the next four years. About 28 percent of Americans think the quality of life in their local communities will improve under Trump – but more than half of members of the white working class who voted for Trump think that it will. In other words, for now at least, Trump's core base of support felt that this was an unusually important election – and that the results stopped what they perceived as the worst-case scenario.Featured Image: EPA(c) 2016, The Washington Post · Philip Bump
A bathroom is a perfect platform to showcase your designer and innovative skills and go beyond ordinary or limited. QS Supplies are popular for their trendy, futuristic, designs concepts and have in the past come up with iconic ideas like the Arch overhead Shower and the Zen Rock Basin . With these radiator concepts, the goal was to create a future-ready appliance that can make full use of its designer potential in any setting, domestic or commercial while performing its basic function of warming up a room. The designer's craft rises to meet this challenge in every aspect with each radiator getting the thumbs-up from interior decorators that have been made familiar with these concepts. Although a bit heavy on the pocket, these ideas for modern as well as traditional styled radiators are refreshing and are well worth the money you spend on them.
It's not hard to find North Korea watchers who are critical about the level of effort being made in South Korea to prepare for major change in the DPRK. Although South Korea's Ministry of Unification has in one form or another been tasked with preparing for reunification since 1969, progress towards the once laudable goal has been at best, glacial. And while government initiatives often get tangled in politics, observers say an additional problem now relates to the general public's increasingly apathetic attitudes towards unification.But although it is understandable that South Korean interest in the DPRK is decreasing with time, the fall of the USSR and Berlin Wall both underscore how seemingly unimaginable changes can quickly change realities on the ground. And if similar changes occur on the Korean peninsula, will South Korea be ready?To find out, we asked eleven defectors to share their thoughts about the current state of preparedness in South Korea and, specifically, about what steps the Seoul government and NGO community should take to better prepare the public for change.From efforts to improve public perceptions of ordinary North Koreans to the need to avoid revenge killings in a post-collapse scenario, many of the responses underscore one important issue: the urgent need to educate South Koreans about the benefits of unification.To learn more about the biographies of the refugees NK News interviewed for this series, please click hereQuestion 4. What do you think are the most urgent and important steps that the South Korean government and relevant NGO / activist organizations should take to prepare for changes in North Korea?South Korea simply wants to avoid unification. That's because the South Koreans are scared of the potential tax burden and of what it will be like to live side-by-side with North Koreans.Because of this, I believe it is important for the South Korean government and NGOs to make efforts to change South Korean perspectives. South Koreans need to be open-minded about living with North Koreans and in particular – to understand that unification is coming and has to come, no matter what they want.I believe the current discourse about unification focuses too much on economic issues and does not focus enough on pointing out that above all unification is about living together.The constant discussion of economic worries will not help relax tensions between North and South Koreans, especially if defectors are discriminated against in South Korea, as they are now. The role of civil society should therefore be to focus on this fact in an effort to change perceptions of living together.South Korea needs to educate North Koreans as to how unethical and anti-democratic their current dictatorship is through the defectors. There's nothing more urgent than the unification of the Korean Peninsula.If more money is spent on national defense while the two Koreas are separated, it affects the economy. Some politicians are waiting for the North Korean regime to collapse on its own. They also try to bring a change through economic cooperation. But these are the wrong methods, I think.The North Korea's regime won't collapse on its own. Economic aid and cooperation will only help the North Korean regime survive and retain its power.The South Korean government therefore needs to help NGOs and organizations more actively engage.Many South Koreans, especially younger ones, are against the unification of Korea. If this continues, unification will never come and the conflict between the two Koreas will never end. NGOs need to raise awareness by putting defectors at the forefront of the debate.North Korea is a closed country. Even the most basic freedoms are limited and government control is strong. People are brainwashed and they cannot receive appropriate information. As such, they don't actually know that they are lacking the most basic human rights – which means they can't even get angry about this. It is therefore critical that more effort is made at informing North Koreans in North Korea about their actual situation.In recent years defectors have confirmed that North Koreans are becoming more and more informed about the outside world through media and information as the border becomes more porous. If NGOS could distribute increased amounts of outside information within North Korea then it would provide impetus for the collapse of North Korean government.In North Korea, you are either the oppressor or the oppressed – there's no such thing as middle ground. But this might all swing in the opposite direction if there are radical changes in the North. Indeed, there will be countless people who hold grudges against the government for its ruthless and oppressive rule.So, without adequate measures after a regime collapse North Korea could become a stage for bloody retaliation. Revenge will beget even more revenge. If we don't prepare beforehand, the country will turn into a bloodbath within just a few months of any major transition.I have heard that people in North Korea's security forces say that they may one day need to escape into China. I think this shows just how high people's hostile sentiment could be — and the level of fear in the North Korean government. Therefore, North Korea will need international aid,
Irony usually conveys a difference between how things seem to be and the reality. As a literary technique it is used when a certain outcome is revealed, but is not what readers were expecting or hoping for. Irony can be difficult to define; it's often subjective and depends on the audience's expectations.Take the song "Ironic" by Alanis Morissette. There were many heated debates when it came out over whether the situations described in the song are actually ironic or just unfortunate incidents. And over the years there were more debates about whether the song really is ironic because it's called "Ironic" but nothing in the song is ironic. Confusing? Yes, that's irony.While it is possible for one person to find something ironc that another person does not, there are several defined categories for irony that apply in life and in literature.Categories of IronyThere are many ways to play with irony. This is great because it brings added layers and texture to a story. Irony is predominantly defined within three main categories: dramatic irony, situational irony, and verbal irony. Let's have some fun with each.Dramatic IronyDramatic irony is used when the audience knows more about what's going on than the characters. This creates suspense, or humor, as the audience waits to see if the characters will come to understand what's really happening. Dramatic irony heightens the audience's anticipation, hopes, or fears, but it can also be used for comedic effect.Have you ever read a novel or watched a play or movie where the narrator was omniscient (knew what every character was thinking and feeling)? These are great setups for dramatic irony.A novel's heroine visits her favorite café every day from 11am to 1pm to work on her manuscript. Her brother's best friend knows this and is trying to find a way to ask her out on a date.The day he gets up the courage to go to the café she's not there. Where is she? The reader knows she's been taken ill, he does not. Now, a healthy dose of suspense is added to the plot.Let's take the same woman and her brother's best friend in a different, comedic direction. She still visits the café every day and her brother's best friend is still determined to tell her how he feels. In this instance, he wants to leave a love poem at her door. One day, thinking she'll be at the café, he goes to her apartment to slide his poem under her door, but we know she's running late and is still at home. Right when he bends down to push the piece of paper under her door, she flings it open in a hurry, steps out, and trips right over him!A woman thinks her boyfriend is about to break up with her. He hasn't been himself lately, acting distracted and distant. We know he bought her an engagement ring and is nervous she won't say yes. He calls her one afternoon and simply says, "I need to see you. Meet me at Columbus Square at six o'clock." She's sure he's going to break up with her. But when she arrives, he's set up a beautiful proposal with a string quartet, dozens of roses, and a huge sparkler of a diamond.In Macbeth by William Shakespeare, Macbeth appears to be loyal to Duncan, but he is actually plotting his murder. Duncan doesn't know Macbeth's plans, but the audience knows what is going to happen.George Orwell makes full use of dramatic irony in Animal Farm. Throughout the book the reader knows many crucial facts that the characters are not aware of. Such as the animals believing Boxer was sent to the hospital, when the reader knows the pigs sold him to the slaughter house and used the money to buy whiskey for themselves.Dramatic irony has a nice place in both comedy and tragedy. As readers wait to see when the main character will "catch on", suspense is building and the pages are turning. For more examples, take a look at Dramatic Irony Examples.Situational IronyThis type of irony occurs when something happens that is completely different from what was expected. Usually, these instances incorporate some type of contradiction and a certain level of shock.An ambulance driver speeds to the scene of a road accident. The victim isn't badly hurt until the ambulance driver whips around a corner and runs over the victim's legs, not realizing she'd crawled to the center of the road.The whole story of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz by L. Frank Baum is a case of situational irony. Dorothy and her friends are in search of external forces to help them get what they need, but discover that they each had what they needed the whole time. Dorothy learns that the shoes she was wearing can get her home. Scarecrow discovers he was
